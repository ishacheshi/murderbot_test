There were other things I hated, but the story having no description was the worst part.\\n\\nThe main character is a murderbot that has social anxiety. It\\'s not done in a relatable way at all. \"Omg they hate me because I\\'m a robot\". It\\'s just said over and over again that the main character feels awkward around humans.\\n\\nLater on the story points out that since the main character is a robot it has no gender and doesn\\'t care about sex. Again there\\'s a whole paragraph on this and it doesn\\'t feel naturally integrated into the story at all. \"Look I\\'m trying to be diverse\". Yeah it\\'s a robot of course it doesn\\'t have to have a gender. Another thing is that the main character reads actually like a girl so this whole gender neutral thing is not working out.

I have so many books to read but I could not keep looking at this book just sitting on my Kindle. Plus, it’s only a novella. I can put off my ARC’s long enough to read a novella right? Well, that’s at least how I convinced myself to read this today. While this book was good sci-fi fun, what really made the read special for me was Murderbot. Only one novella and a short story read and I’m already in love with Murderbot. The story had some good action and a decent sci-fi plot, but Murderbot was the main attraction.

No sooner have we met and loved Murderbot, than a creature attacks them.\\nThe hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun.\\nMurderbot is sometimes good at its job, so it rescues its charges and goes on its way.\\n\\nThere's one thing about Murderbot though, all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\\n\\nFor some reason, the universe is conspiring to keep Murderbot away from its TV shows. It's all it lives for. All it cares for, liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\\n\\nThis is the samest same I have ever samed. It's a lot easier to deal with fictional characters. They're limited to the realm of your imagination and when you don't want to deal with them you just don't think about them. But some characters sneak past that barrier. They thrive beyond your escapism and latch themselves onto you like a barnacle. Some annoy you. Some fascinate you. Some turn you on. But most importantly, some are you.\\n\\nI am Murderbot. Patron saint of all antisocial introverts everywhere who just want to be left alone. But Murderbot is too- special. It deserves friends. It deserves joy, freedom and all the things we're told to live for. Will it get them?

I just found out that Ms. Wells has sold a total of four (count em (4)) novellas in the Murderbot series with the second titled \"Artificial Condition\" (16.99 for a hardcover and 9.99 for the kindle) to appear somewhere near the beginning of 2018 and upon a bit of research found the the book here at GR ->\\n\\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...?\\n\\nBook 3 is scheduled to be a hardcover titled \"Rogue Protocol\" (The Murderbot Diaries #3) found here -->\\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...\\n\\nand also priced at 16.99 (for 160 pages) print and ten bucks for the kindle. (Aug 7, 2018) then book 4 \"Exit Strategy\" (The Murderbot Diaries #4) prior to years end.\\n\\nWhat have I gotten myself into ?\\n\\nEntry #2\\n\\nWell now I\\'m 100 pages into the book and quite enjoying it. I also found an interview with Ms. Wells. Here is one of the questions regarding this book:\\n\\nQ: Has there been any interest in turning All Systems Red into a movie or TV show?\\n\\nA: No, there’s been no interest that I know of. I’m not sure what would work best, though a movie or TV show would have to have a lot of voiceover, since so much of the story is internal to the main character.\\n\\nQ: If this did happen, who would you like to see play the main characters and why them?\\n\\nA: I’m not sure who would play Murderbot. I was always kind of imagining Viola Davis [Suicide Squad] for Dr. Mensah. In the story, Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon, is meant to be a far future version of How To Get Away With Murder.\\n\\nEntry # 3\\n\\nI have read a couple of times now, in two different interviews, that Ms. Wells credits that murderbot was inspired by Tanith Lee\\'s \"Silver Metal Lover\" and Tanith Lee\\'s writing in general. Ms. Wells has grown in stature in my reading opinion.\\n\\nThis book was certainly well written and an entertaining story and I totally look forward to the next installment of this series.\\n2017-09-books-bought\\n101 likes\\n3 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

I could easily understand the political structure, where security units fit, the governing module, Peservation Society, the tech, the social rules, and medical capabilities just from following along with the plot. What is most gripping about the story is the juxtaposition of a character designed to protect humans who can't actually stand them. Murderbot is also completely untethered to its programming, and so wouldn't even have to continue protecting humans, but does so for mysterious reasons, and is only really interested in watching TV. I love speculative fiction that can give social commentary on the present, and so many of us can probably relate to Murderbot—compelled to serve society, while kind of detesting fellow humans, and only actually being motivated to rot at home. What a weirdly contradictory mode of being. And yet, Murderbot is capable, heroic, and likable. The character is so gripping, I may just have to continue with the series. Even though I find the plot to be predictable and simplistic, and the emotional impact to be non-existent. I also don't like any of the other characters, who don't seem developed or to get arcs. As a reader who likes earnest stories, deep themes, and epic scope, a cozy sci-fi probably isn't going to be my cup of tea. But Murderbot is a complex and intriguing enough character that I could see myself coming back for future installments just to see what the character will do next.\\nsci-fi\\n101 likes\\n4 comments\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

The plot's straight-forward, the prose is decent, and it's charming and witty. Murderbot, who repeatedly says that she'd rather be netflixing, is surprisingly relatable. One of my favorite parts is when Murderbot is faced with the prospect of spending time with people and is (understandably) horrified. She can't control her facial reaction which in turn makes the human crew she's assigned to uncomfortable to know that they're making Murderbot uncomfortable (and that she has feelings as human as any of them).\\n\\nAlso, I've just realized that I've been using female pronouns for Murderbot, when Murderbot is actually genderless and is referred to as 'it' by the crew. For some reason I naturally thought of Murderbot as being female and I'm not sure why, maybe because the author is a woman?\\n\\nPosted in Mr. Philip's Library\\n2017-releases\\n \\nauthor-woman\\n \\nhugo\\n \\n...more\\n99 likes\\n18 comments\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

Short, action packed and just enough of a story to make you fall for a Murderbot.\\n\\nOriginal Review\\n\\nI totally enjoyed this. As a book recommended to me by multiple good reads friends I knew that there was a high probability that would happen but what I didn’t expect was to fall in love with a SecUnit (fancy talk for cyborg) with a malfunctioning governors unit (more fancy talk for something that makes you behave).\\n\\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\\'t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\\n\\nMurderbot is assigned to a group of humans exploring a planet to see if it can be terraformed for a new colony. It is basically doing the least amount of work possible, just half-assing everything more worried about the serials it is watching that doing its job. Really it is just going through the motions for most things until everything starts going wrong for the team it is protecting and now Murderbot has to step up their game or all of the humans will end up dead and it will end up reprogrammed or worse.\\n\\nThe humans in the party notice that something is maybe a little off about Murderbot just after one of its members is almost eaten by a huge wormish thing and all the trouble starts. Murderbot doesn’t enjoy one on one interaction with the team at all and it is hilarious some of the stuff it thinks while trying to learn how to by an integral member of the team and keep them alive.\\n\\n“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.”\\n\\nThe story is short but completely entertaining. It is what I always hope I’ll find in a SciFi book but rarely do. A fun story with a great cast of characters that doesn’t get too caught up on the geekiness factor and try to overexplain everything. This was just a great ride with a funny, pessimistic cyborg that has problems dealing with real people and prefers to hide behind an opaqued mask. I can totally relate to most of that anyway. But Murderbot is completely endearing in their own way.\\n\\n“Gurathin turned to me. \"So you don\\'t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\"\\nI looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”\\n\\nI’m completely hooked and will definitely catch up on the series as this seems like it is going to be a great ride.\\n\\nD.G. was the first friend to recommend this to me but not the last so thanks for the great recommendation guys.\\n4-5-stars\\n \\nawesome-audio\\n \\nbeautifully-broken-bastards\\n \\n...more\\n86 likes\\n14 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

Yep, a security bot made to kill people (and other stuff) is actually shy and would rather watch TV. *lol*\\n\\nThe writing was fast-paced and engaging, every character lively and distinct (not always easy, especially not in short stories) and the unobtrusive humour was delightful.\\n\\nI will definitely continue reading this series after the great ending to this and can\\'t wait to know more about Murderbot\\'s adventures and self-discovery that also teach us a lot about what it is to be \"human\".\\n86 likes\\n42 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

And narrates a delightfully fun, filmic sci-fi\\nNobody was touching my humans & My clients are the best clients\\n\\nThe heart of this novella is definitely the sarcastic narration of Murderbot, who has very strong K-2SO vibes, the sarcastic droid from Star Wars Rogue One.\\nEarly on this droid (with organic components) already notes: As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\\nThis is definitely true, 35.000 hours of entertainment is more interesting than killing to this droid, and later on we learn that this is only a SecUnit, not really an entity meant for heavy duty military work (I’m not a combat Murderbot).\\n\\nThe plot is an exploration of a planet gone wrong, with quite some tropes (think of Data from Star Trek Next Generation foremost) but also subversions of what you learn to expect from standard sci-fi.\\nI had a lot of fun following Murderbot on adventure, for instance the following observation: I am always supposed to speak respectfully to clients even when they accidentally are to commit suicide or Murderbot plus actual humans equal akward and not to forget: Also, I don’t care & And blablabla\\n\\nThe novella is super filmic and high on action, but still it will be hard to convey the sass of Murderbot in a compelling manner, and Scarlet Johansson will probably never say: To kill the shit out of it.\\n78 likes\\n4 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

In fact, i think it accomplishes something extraordinary in regard to murderbot’s character. we get important (albeit limited) background info that contextualizes its current rogue state, we see it forced to contend with external threats and internal dilemmas about not liking people but being tasked to protect a small group of them anyway, and the ending gives us insight into its intentions and motivations—all without ever feeling rushed or contrived. again, in only half the length of the average book!! and with a nonhuman protagonist!!! that is a feat indeed. (i do think the conflict resolution happened a bit quickly but murderbot can’t always be narrating like a human, so i’m not going to complain too much about it.)\\n\\nthat being said, i still feel like i have absolutely no grasp on the world and only a very weak understanding of the sci fi elements. i think the former might be intentional, because i have a million questions and i’m certain that if i went back and reread only like two (if that) could be answered. the latter is more of a me problem because there is sufficient information for readers to keep up, but i just felt like the details got lost on me, and i would sit there wondering what was going on and how exactly the technology worked. hoping the second novella will clear some things up for me but i did really really love this and it makes me sad to give it less than 4 stars so take this as a very affectionate 3.5 \\U0001f979',\n",

But despite Murderbot's name for itself, it's actually a rather hilarious & relatable individual.\\n\\nBeing deeply invested in downloaded media & characterized by it's inability to interact with humans without being awkward, I feel as though Murderbot will connect with many readers on a personal level.\\n\\nThe short arc of this story is entertaining to say the least & even manages to pack in some heavy themes about autonomy & friendship (HELLO THIS IS WHAT I WANTED BUT DID NOT GET FROM AUTONOMOUS!)\\n\\nIt really appeals to my desire for Science Fiction that doesn't require hundreds of pages & convoluted paragraphs to make its point. I'll definitely be continuing on, as I'm intrigued to see what more is in store for Murderbot!\\n4-star\\n \\nyear-2018\\n75 likes\\n15 comments\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Book Clubbed\\n149 reviews\\n225 followers\\nFollow\\nJune 7, 2021\\nI stumbled across Fugitive Telemetry when I received it as an ARC, which is the 6th novella in this series. I should have started, properly, with #1, but I\\'m a shortsighted fool. Despite my misstep, I\\'m circling back to read the series in order. There are already over 12,000 reviews of this book, and I doubt I have anything groundbreaking to add, so I wanted to do something different and examine the opening paragraph of this book, which I think captures the entire appeal of Murderbot:\\n\\n\"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\\n\\nIs this not the most human instinct you have ever encountered? The extremes, like murder or saving a life, are hard. They take hard work, discipline, and passion. Life is a constant negotiation between the chasm of what we could achieve--if we will lived up to our full potential--and the humdrum, realistic accomplishments we actually achieve. If you can\\'t be the best murderer, why even murder at all?\\n\\nInstead, it is much easier to let waves of shiny, prolix entertainment wash over you. I know I have! Hell, right now, I have been sitting on my couch, reading this very book. Now, I have justifications I can tell myself because this is a book, instead of a TV show or a movie featuring Kevin James or whoever. Is it really that different, though? Escaping into a book instead of creating something, volunteering, murdering, etc. You know, things that take resolve.\\n\\nDespite these misgivings, Murderbot is pulled into adventures because of its job title. Namely, it has to save humans from themselves, which is not as exciting as becoming a villain but allows for many more moments of humor and unexpected tenderness.\\n\\nListen to full reviews at https://bookclubbed.buzzsprout.com/.\\n77 likes\\n10 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

But I am a big fan of good, crisp writing, and an even bigger fan of all my friends who loved this book -- 21 of my GR friends have rated this! And I only have 59 friends here. I didn't read this for a long, long time, because I was afraid I wouldn't like it, and then carol., Nataliya, Dennis, Vivian, Mitticus, David, Monica, Jennifer, Jade, Allie, Barbara K., Rebecca, Stephen an Anna would never speak to me again.\\n\\nJust kidding about the two stars, by the way -- I just did that to irritate Nataliya. I'll fix it in a couple of days.\\n\\nThis was a great little book. There's a thin plot about a daring escape, realization that Somebody Is Chasing Us, and yet another daring escape. The plot was not the point. No, what made this so enjoyable was the personality of the narrator, a person that many misanthropic readers (i.e., most of us, at least sometimes) can identify with. It's absurd to believe that we developed big brains to be able to hunt mastadons or whatever -- the real reason we developed big brains, of course, is that we're in a zero-sum arms race against one another, constantly walking a tightrope between power and submission even with people we love.\\n\\nWhat a fucking relief to walk away from all that for 163 pages. Murderbot is responsible only for the humans' physical safety and need not concern itself with their approval, satisfaction or any of the other things that make life so stressful. This was done with gentle humor and also with sharply-barbed commentary on slavery, people as rental property, and the disdain with which large bureaucracies treat their members and the public.\\n\\nLooking forward to the rest of the series.\\n72 likes\\n30 comments\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

It makes us sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here.\\nAs opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do, what I should do, what I needed to do.\\n\\nMartha Wells has done an amazing job with making the construct Murderbot, as they call themselves in The Murderbot Diaries, completely empathizable! And this is coming from someone who doesn't like the robots-take-over-world trope. But Murderbot, doesn't care about the world, and does their job half heartedly, while devoting most of their free processing time to entertainment. Being a construct doesn't mean they are devoid of feelings or emotions however, and complex ones like social anxiety too. Working security with a team of scientists who don't just leave it alone gives space for a lot of character development.\\n\\nIt's tough to do inner monologues well, but it's great when done well and I really enjoyed Wells' writing. The book is a short novella with them escaping danger as the base plot, and more page space was devoted to characterization than world-building. But I didn't mind that, as the story could have been happening on any outer planet common in Sci-Fi. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series!\\n\\n🌟🌟🌟🌟\\n\\n[3/4 star for the premise and the whole book; One star for the characterization; Half a star for the world-building; 3/4 star for the story; One star for the writing - Four stars in total.]\\n2024-reads\\n \\nreviewed-in-words\\n92 likes\\n6 comments\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

Now it works in security and calls itself a Murderbot. Bored with its existence it whiles away the time watching TV soaps in between and while on jobs.

Written in a first person perspective, the story was very entertaining and humerous. The writing style was quite casual, which felt slightly awkward on the page. Given the length of the story, there was not a lot of world-building in this novella. I wanted more explanation of technology and the surrounding world. However, this is the first book in the Murderbot Diaries series so there may be more world-building in the later books.

       "  'text': 'Bookishrealm\\n3,241 reviews\\n6,429 followers\\nFollow\\nDecember 31, 2020\\nThanks to Bethany for picking out this book for me for our TBR swap. I\\'ve been trying to slowly get into more sci-fi and this definitely was the perfect place to start\\n\\nAll Systems Red is definitely not what I was expecting in terms of science fiction books. I think that I was going into this book expecting something serious; HOWEVER, this book was definitely more on the light hearted side. It focuses on this A.I. being named Murderbot who is contracted out to work with a group of humans. While there were some great plot points, I think I became invested in the story because of the character development. I would love to be friends with Murderbot. They have a quirky sense of humor and I absolutely love the process that they go through in bonding with the crew. I haven\\'t read a book in a while where I wanted to be friends with the main character.\\n\\nThere is also this great conversation about the definition of what it means to be human and also the treatment of creatures/beings that aren\\'t the \"normally\" identified as having the same organic composition as humans. It\\'s clear that Murderbot has inner thought that deal with this conversation. The manner in which he interacts with the other characters and how they interact with him is super important to the story as a whole. I felt myself getting all warm and fuzzy inside about some of the things I saw develop between them.\\n\\nOverall, this was a quick and great read. I loved the action that took place even if it wasn\\'t the focul point of the story for me. I\\'m interested in seeing where the next story is going to go especially based on how this one ended. I\\'m excited to hear more from Murderbot\\'s perspective. If you haven\\'t picked up this series yet I highly recommend it!\\nadult-science-fiction\\n \\naudiobook\\n \\nbooks-i-own\\n \\n...more\\n57 likes\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

To me, Murderbot is a He. Now, with this obvious infuriating and offending personal preference out of some people’s way, let’s dive in. SPOILERS ahead.\\n\\nBelieve me when I tell you that you’ll find it simply impossible not to love this self-aware SecUnit that hacked into his own governor module and is anxious around humans and doesn\\'t like showing his face.\\n\\nHow can you not like the funny, sarcastic bot thinking he\\'s a complete failure at his murdering job and would rather watch tv shows?\\n\\nMurderbot might feel like an unreliable narrator because it’s very obvious he’s struggling with his identity and feelings and confusion about what it means to be alive and free, but his tone is absolutely a blast. He’s sarcastic, awkward, anxious, uncomfortable around humans, he hates them but also cares for them, he doesn’t like showing his face, but also does it when requested by a certain someone, even though he was not forced to do it (he was a Free Agent, no longer a slave of his programming).\\n\\n\\nBut she had barely looked at me and I had barely looked at her because again, murderbot + actual human = awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\nI put the pilot’s console on standby, and looked at Mensah. She pressed her lips together, like she wanted to say something and was repressing the urge. Then she nodded firmly and said, “Good luck.”\\n\\nI felt like I should say something to her, and didn’t know what, and just stared at her awkwardly for a few seconds. Then I sealed up my helmet and got out of the hopper as fast as I could.\\n\\n\\n\\nMensah sent me a private message through the feed: I hope you’re all right.\\n\\nBecause you need me. I don’t know where that came from. Alright, it came from me, but she was my client, I was a SecUnit. There was no emotional contract between us. There was no rational reason for me to sound like a whiny human baby.\\n\\n\\nThis shows perfectly how confused he was by his own thoughts and desires, his feelings often betraying an underlying need for connection even when he claims he despises it, even when he doesn’t know how to feel about his own thoughts.\\n\\nI mean, how adorable is that? No? Too emotional and lovey-dovey? How about this?\\n\\n\\n\"So you don’t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.”\\n\\n“Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s another question I’d like the answer to.”\\nGurathin looked at me expectantly. She isn’t talking about me, idiot.\\n\\n\\n\\nGurathin hesitated. “It’s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.”[…] “It’s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can’t be watching it, not in that volume; we’d notice.”\\n\\nI snorted. He underestimated me.\\n\\nRatthi said, “The one where the colony’s solicitor killed the terraforming supervisor who was the secondary donor for her implanted baby?”\\n\\nAgain, I couldn’t help it. I said, “She didn’t kill him, that’s a fucking lie.”\\n\\nRatthi turned to Mensah. “It’s watching it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It calls itself ‘Murderbot’ , Gurathin said.\\nFrom their expressions I knew everything I felt was showing on my face, and I hate that. I grated out, “That was private.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t need to look at me. I’m not a sexbot.”\\n\\n\\nThis is the other side of him, the part that makes us laugh. But even in this sort of aggression and displeasure of interacting with humans, it’s so obvious that he does this because some other part of him is fighting back. It’s a paradox within him that he struggles with to reconcile. So to Murderbot the human interactions felt like he was seen as a thing to be used for their own gratification. He lives in a world where constructs like him, half robot half human parts, are treated and used as slaves. They were lucky if they were bought by a decent human being to free their contract. As he states, most of those bots fall in love with their guardians, albeit in secret.\\n\\nWhen DeltFall, a sister habitat on the other side of the planet Murderbot is currently operating on with his crew, is going silent, they set on a mission to find out what\\'s going on with that base.\\n\\nUpon entering the base, he finds out the humans were indeed dead and the SecUnits in there went rogue. He tried to kill them but got captured and they implanted a combat module in the socket behind his head to turn him against his own crew. When he is saved by Dr. Mensah, and brought back to their hopper, they try to save him, but he demands to be put down and when his request is denied, he shoots himself to spare the humans from being hurt by him.\\n\\nNeedless to say he was brought back by the crew but they also found out that Murderbot was a free agent all along. Now they suspect him for tampering with their wrong maps and the whole messed up mission. However, several crew members vouch for Murderbot for not, well, murdering them.\\n\\nEventually they find out who killed the DeltFall people and they try to escape from the planet, fortunately succeeding in their attempt.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t help myself but Mensah and Murderbot were just so cute working together and interacting. It was obvious he felt more comfortable around her as opposed to how he felt towards other humans. She respects him, she understands his struggles. Maybe it\\'s the romantic in me, but I felt like there was a deeper connection between them. The private talks between them are so powerful, so intimate and precious I just melted.\\n\\nPersonally, I found it so sweet how Murderbot listens to Mensah\\'s request of removing his helmet and showing his face to the rest of the crew. I’m fairly certain after I noticed many interactions between them, that he cares a lot about her, calling her his ‘favorite human’.\\n\\n\\n“I know you’re more comfortable with keeping your helmet opaque, but the situation has changed. We need to see you.”\\n[...]\\n“It’s usually better if humans think of me as a robot.” I said.\\n“Maybe, under normal circumstances.” [...] But this situation is different. It would be better if they could think of you as a person who is trying to help. Because that’s how I think of you..”\\n\\nMy insides melted. That’s the only way I could describe it.\\n\\n\\nThe relationship between Mensah and Murderbot starts like a strong friendship, though sometimes it might feel romantic to some of us ( maybe because we operate on different parameters). Though he specified that he doesn’t have a gender nor the sex parts for any gender, I’ll argue till our sun fails to rise that a romantic relationship is not strictly related to your gender or what’s down below the waist (robot, human, or alien). So, in that regard, I don’t agree with others who vehemently state that there could be no romantic relationship developing between them because of the aforementioned reason.\\n\\nThis first part concludes with Mensah buying Murderbot’s contract and becoming his Guardian or in other words, his owner. As already mentioned, constructs like him are used by people or companies for different jobs, but can be bought and then they would have a guardian.\\n\\nBut the ending is actually bittersweet and he actually runs away, refusing to go with Mensah, not because he doesn\\'t want to live with her, but because he doesn\\'t want to be told what to want and who he is. He wants to find out who he truly is and to be free, which I can totally understand considering beings like him were slaves.\\n\\nSo excited to jump right into the next volumes.',\n",

In a word: meh\\n\\nin detail:\\nI’m too old for this novella, I think.\\n\\nLook, I get that teens and young people today are incredibly freaked out about security and real (or imagined) threats loom large in their worldview.\\n\\nI also get that that freaked-outed-ness leads to bingeing on media, smartphone addiction, gaming addiction, RPG & Cosplay popularity and the demand for permanent safe spaces, etc etc to escape a terrifying, unsafe reality they feel they just can’t cope with.\\n\\nEmotional overload and exhaustion comes from the feeling of being constantly on fear alert, ie “all systems red” all the time.\\n\\nHighly functioning autistics are all the literary rage because that not only provides some diversity in fiction, but also mirrors the fear non-neurodivergent young people have of ‘bad’ emotions (danger!), interacting with live people who have not been internet screened (danger!) and experiencing sensory overload (danger!) from ubiquitous screens and non-stop information streams. (Social anxiety/confusion and sensory overload are often experienced by autistics.)\\n\\nSo here we have an “autistic” behaving security unit with a hacked gov programme, i.e. it’s brain-simulation is now not normal (= neurodiverse).\\n\\nIt can't wait to escape into streamed media because “it’s easier to deal with imaginary emotions than real ones,” prefers to keep its helmet opaque to maintain an emotional barrier between it and others, is constantly monitoring info scans (just the facts), can’t look people in the eye and prefers to always wear its armour to protect its organic parts (i.e. skin sensitivity).\\n\\nAll typical autism behaviour. But it has a job to do -- namely, maintaining a safe space for the group. \\nAnd when its people want to give it a cosy, liberated life, it runs away. It doesn’t know what it wants, but Mom and Dad are stifling it with their idyllic expectations. If that's not immaturity!\\n\\nMurderbot is basically modern teens/young people and their world view reflected in sci-fi. That’s cool for young people, I'm sure, but I can’t relate to any of it.\\n\\nChillins, Grandma’s just too old for all that. 2 stars.\\n2024-reads\\n \\nnorth-american-lit\\n \\nnovellas\\n \\n...more\\n56 likes\\n18 comments\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

Murderbot’s dry humor and reluctant heroism hooked me early on.\\n\\nThe final pages gave the story real emotional weight and elevated it from a clever concept to something quietly profound.\\n\\nHighly recommended if you enjoy character-driven sci-fi with heart, sarcasm, and an unforgettable ending.\\n55 likes\\n6 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

Estoy dentro.\\n\\nNo creo que entiendan lo obsesionado que estoy con este personaje. Por más absurdo que pueda sonar… sí, en gran parte me siento identificado con un robot asesino con armas en sus brazos (déjenme excursarme). Un gran mérito de la autora, digo, lograr que esta pieza de ciencia ficción se sienta real, el carácter de su personaje es clave: un ser que no solo prefiere evitar cualquier interacción humana por su poco desenvolvimiento social, sino que pasa su tiempo sobrepensando cómo lo perciben los demás y, no mucho menos importante, que quieren que lo dejen terminar su serie. Entre él y yo, solo hay unos pistolas-brazos de diferencia.\\n\\n➤ \"Por eso me alegro de no pertenecer a la humanidad. Siempre llegan a estas conclusiones absurdas\".\\n\\nClaramente no cuenta con la popularidad ni alcance que considero que debe tener, así que paso a contarles: se centra en Matabot, uno de los tantos androides fabricados y alquilados por una famosa aseguradora. Se supone que las empresas/corporaciones de este universo alquilan a estos androides como un servicio soporte para sus respectivas misiones, y es exactamente eso lo que hace un equipo de investigación, sin embargo, la unidad que alquilaron no es del todo convencional. Esta unidad, autodenominada Matabot, ha logrado hackear el sistema y, por lo tanto, funciona independientemente y es \\'inmune\\' a las órdenes programadas. ¿Un androide diseñado para hacer daño con conciencia y libre albedrío? Lo sé, suena al fin de la humanidad, pero no se preocupen, Matabot nos deja en claro sus intenciones desde el primer párrafo: \"Podría haberme puesto a matar gente después de hackear mi módulo de control, pero entonces me di cuenta de que tenía acceso a la red combinada de canales de entretenimiento (… ) Habían transcurrido unas 35.000 horas desde entonces, sin demasiadas matanzas, pero seguramente habría pasado, no sé, poco menos de 35.000 horas consumiendo películas, telenovelas, libros, obras de teatro y música. Como máquina de matar despiadada, era un completo fracaso\".\\n\\n➤ \"Demasiada atención. Me di la vuelta para refugiarme en un rincón, de espaldas a los humanos\".\\n\\nComo libro, creo que está ejecutado de forma original e inteligente; narrado en primera persona, seguimos la aventura en el desconocido planeta bajo los ojos de Matabot. Eso sí, no esperes complejidad en el universo ni un arco argumental con giros, el acierto de la novela es el monólogo del protagonista: humorístico, irónico y en un constante conflicto humanizado. La aventura de los científicos es lo suficientemente entretenida como para no desdibujarse y se complementa con otros subtópicos que se presentan. No creo que la entrega de los planetas por parte de las entidades corporativas para su explotación fuera una no intencionada crítica al sistema capitalista y mercantil. Así mismo como los humanos \"mejorados\" y estos androides alquilados con partes orgánicas parecen un distópico presagio de cómo la tecnología podría ir compenetrándose aún más con el humano, como si se tratase de un episodio aterrador más de Black Mirror.\\n\\n➤ \"Las entrañas me dieron un vuelco. Detesto tener emociones por cosas reales. Prefiero tenerlas por El santuario de la luna\".\\n\\nPerfecto comienzo, perfecto final, y extremadamente corto. Con un conflicto interno constante, Matabot llama a la reflexión sobre el libre albedrío, ¿cuál es el precio de la libertad?, el hackeo lo humaniza porque por primera vez siente el peso de la toma de sus propias decisiones: y es ahí donde más me reflejo. Una grata introducción que me dejó algo hambriento. Afortunadamente, la autora ha dejado mucho más que un platillo. Supongo que nos vemos pronto, Matabot.\\n\\n➤ \"Vale, prefiero a las personas imaginarias del canal de entretenimiento antes que a las de verdad, pero no se puede tener lo ficticio sin lo real\".\\n2022\\n48 likes\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

Murderbot is already one of my favorite characters I've read from this year - snarky, easily annoyed, and just wants to be left the hell alone but also shy, sensitive, and protective. I did struggle a little bit with getting the other characters confused and the lack of world building, but I'm not sure what one can expect in this short of a book. I'm sure that will work itself out as the series continues, and I know I am continuing.

He finds this easier than dealing with the world.\\n\\nI was already enjoying myself thoroughly because Murderbot is so sarcastic (sample line: \"The hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun\"), but I just melted all over inside when Murderbot takes off his armor and is revealed to be a human hybrid, and not a full robot, like the humans have assumed (it becomes clear that is an assumption Murderbot wants them to make, but more on that later). The specific thing that made me melt is that he was cold and had to wrap himself up in a blankie, and the contrast between a cold, robotic killing machine that you expect, and the actual living being that has feelings and likes to be warm and comfy almost made me lose my mind out of immediate and intense affection for the lonely little guy.

Всі системи: небезпека» Марти Веллс – якісна сучасна космічна фантастика, якої ну дуже мало видається останнім часом на нашому ринку.\\n\\nКнига прочитана в рамках рубрики #читаю_на_роботі. Дуже давно хотів познайомитись з цією серією, чув від відвідувачів книгарні тільки позитивні відгуки про неї, тому вибір був очевидний.\\n\\nКоротенько про сюжетікс.\\n\\nДалеке майбутнє, боротьба між космічними компаніями за ресурси та вплив триває. Головний герой – вартмех, якому вдалося зламати власний модуль контролю. За контрактом він охороняє місію дослідників на далекій планеті. Він вправно виконує обов’язки, а у вільний час дивиться серіальчики. Але спокійна місія закінчується, коли сусідня експедиція потрапляє в халепу, а вбивцебот з супутниками має докопатися до правди, щоб вижити.\\n\\nА тепер про враження. Єдиний відчутний для мене недолік книги – не супер-пупер розкриття всесвіту. Так, я згоден, що на 150 сторінках не розгуляєшся. Авторка і так вмудрилась пояснити чимало аспектів життя людства у майбутньому, але моя допитливість та інтерес хочуть більшого. І дуже хочуть! Тому сподіваюсь, що у наступних частинах дочекаємось більше подробиць.\\n\\nПодії відбуваються дуже динамічно, нудно точно не буде. Все просто несеться. Текст захоплює з головою і не відпускає. Бам-бам. Екшончика вистачає. Головний герой ну дуже чудовий. Тут і оповідь від першої особи, але мені зазвичай не заходить, прям доречна. Його думки, логіка, прийняття рішень, філософія – бімба. Дуже близький мені цей протагоніст. Можливо, я теж вбивцебот, хах?)\\n\\nРезультат: це саме те, чого не вистачає на поличках фантастики. Дуже не вистачає. Не баріться – купуйте та читайте. Книжка точно потрапляє в улюблені, серію продовжу читати.\\n2024\\n \\n5-star\\n \\nfantasy\\n45 likes\\n1 comment\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

They are a bit different from most of the Company SepcUnits becuase they have modified themselves to take out the control that the Company and the humans have over them, but they know that this is incredibly dangerous for them and so they have to keep this hidden and just pretend to still be functioning as they should.\\n\\nI really liked the character of Murderbot as it's really quite a grump when it comes to humanity and it's quite cynical about our kind. I enjoyed the inner monologues and pessimistic outlook a lot more than I expected, becuase a snarky but witty robot is always something worth reading about.\\n\\nThis is the story of a team on a new planet who are conducting research but whilst they are there they are interrupted by an attack and Murderbot has to rescue some of them. Quickly it comes to light that the attack may not have just been chance, and we follow the team as they try (with Murderbot's help) to uncover what really went on and who is acting against them...\\n\\nI found this a fun and quick read with some great twists and ideas. The characterisation is brilliant, and the story is good fun too so I am very happy I finally got to read this one and I am certain that I want to continue on with the series too. Solid 4*s from me :)\\nbooktubesff-2018\\n \\nbooktubesff2018\\n44 likes\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Evelina | AvalinahsBooks\\n925 reviews\\n472 followers\\nFollow\\nMarch 16, 2018\\nI had heard all sorts of wonderful things about All Systems Red before I picked it up (I have a lot of Goodreads friends who know their stuff when it comes to sci-fi! Yes, I\\'m looking at you, Caro M.) Now I trust their recommendations even more, because this book is easily my best February read. You can read the post with better formatting here on my blog.\\n\\n5 Reasons To Read All Systems Red\\n\\n\"Murderbot\" is a jailbroken security android (cyborg? Well, you know.) Basically, SecUnits (as they\\'re called) function as remotely controlled synthetic human slaves, basically, and they don\\'t get a say in any of what they\\'re doing, which is mostly murdering hostiles and getting mashed in the process. Murderbot though, a name it has sarcastically given itself (and will be henceforth referred to as \\'them\\' in this review), have jailbroken themselves and would rather just watch hours and hours of sci-fi soaps than interact with humans, who actually give them anxiety fits. Murderbot is incredibly introverted, you see. But in order to not disclose a) having a mind b) having free will c) their predilection towards sci-fi soap operas, Murderbot still has to do their job. Which is how they end up on a ship with a crew they actually don\\'t hate, but... on a mission nobody should be on. Hint: it\\'s a mission that is kind of hard to survive, and it\\'s clearly rigged.\\n\\n\\nReason #1. Murderbot Is More Human Than The Actual Humans\\n\\nMurderbot comes across as an incredibly introverted personality who is empathetic like any other human being (maybe more so?), but shy of it and trying to hide it even from their own self. Seeing them turn to face the corner when talking to humans or panic while trying not to have their fave scrunch up into a mask of despair when being spoken to was incredibly amusing - and not in a mean way. Murderbot\\'s shyness is SO relatable! You will love this character to bits. I know I did.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReason #2. It\\'s Like A Doctor Who Episode With David Tennant\\n\\nFor any Doctor Who fans, this book is like a good episode from the Tennant days – a hostile planet pretending to be neutral, and things slowly get worse and worse and he crew has to figure out what is up. It\\'s just so good! My interest didn\\'t drop even once, while reading this. And I realized how much I miss a good Doctor Who episode from the old days. (Well... the \"newer old days\"!)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought this was topical on the whole #FEELS topic. Ha. Topic. Topical. (Don\\'t hit me.)\\n\\n\\nReason #3. The Virtues\\n\\nThis book has incredibly good virtues and such an amazing moral atmosphere. And it\\'s presented in such a self-deprecating manner as well (Shruti, you must read this!) Murderbot is willing to throw themselves in danger to protect the ones they care about, even though they\\'re aware humans are not really supposed to care \"back\". It\\'s really touching how Murderbot calls them \"my humans\". I would say Murderbot is a true sci-fi knight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReason #4. Murderbot\\'s Gender Or Lack Thereof\\n\\nWell, this is going to be hard to formulate. So, have you ever felt underrepresented? If you\\'re a woman, you most likely have. Because we\\'ve got like maybe 2 heroes who jump in and save the day. Other than that, guys always do all the saving. Murderbot though? They don\\'t really have a gender (and are often referred to as ‘it\\' in the book, but I refuse - Murderbot has too much personality for that!) Anyway, despite probably looking like Terminator, Murderbot is not referred to as male - which is why I found myself imagining them more female than male by the middle of the book! I was surprised, but I figure it comes from wanting to see myself represented as able to do stuff, you know? And Murderbot I\\'d a character that lets you do that. It\\'s pretty great.\\n\\n\\nReason #5. It\\'s Just So Funny!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo maybe this should have been the number one reason. This book will keep you laughing throughout the entire time you\\'re reading it, I mean, when you\\'re not having #feels. The manner it is written, and especially the manner Murderbot talks in is just priceless. I can\\'t wait for further installments of The Murderbot diaries!\\n\\n\\nOther Books You Might Like\\n\\nI wish I could recommend you more books like that! But such gems are not common. And I would be very happy if you recommended me something similar. Meanwhile, I can only think of two books that fit the style – in terms of humor, at least. Redshirts has the same kind of \"I can\\'t stop laughing\" thing going on, and also shares some moments of poignancy by the end. It\\'s also impossible to put down. As for The Martian, some of the topics might be unrelated at all, but the main character is similar to Murderbot – very resourcefull, brave and has the same vein of humor in the way he talks. It\\'s also written in first person. I enjoyed both of these a lot!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead Post on My Blog | My Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter\\nbooks-of-2018\\n \\nfavorites\\n \\nfiction\\n \\n...more\\n43 likes\\n8 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Ɗẳɳ 2.☊\\n160 reviews\\n313 followers\\nFollow\\nApril 25, 2020\\nI must say, for a story subtitled The Murderbot Diaries, there was an appalling lack of murder and mayhem contained within these pages—well, at least by the hand of the so-called Murderbot. And that’s a shame because what other reason than to bathe in the glorious carnage would a reader select a title like this . . . ?\\n\\nMurderbot, as it dubs itself, is assigned to the security detail of a scientific expedition on an alien world. Its main roles are to protect the scientists from unknown alien threats and to ensure the success of the mission. Part man part machine, it’s designed to be entirely under the control of its clients. However, a malfunction in its programming has left it with free will—a fact that it hides from its employers for fear of being decommissioned. As well as the fact that it’s not the terrifying monster it appears to be. Underneath all that armor is one clever, quick-witted, and surprisingly sympathetic individual.\\n\\nOn the surface, all appears to be copacetic, but in reality, it only puts in the bare minimum of effort so as to devote as much time as possible to binge its favorite shows from the entertainment feed. It’s much more concerned about the fate of those fictional characters than its human masters. The only problem is there’s a section missing from their map of the planet, and the other expedition is failing to respond to their inquiries.\\n\\nSabotage seems to be afoot, and, sadly, Murderbot may have to pause its shows long enough to put in a real effort . . .\\n\\nThis story was completely lacking in depth of character. In fact, some of the names were so challenging—Bharadwaj, Volescu, Pin-Lee, Ratthi, Overse, Guarathin—that it was difficult to even keep track of who’s who, let alone their motivations. Even though the story was only a novella, I can’t forgive the lack of character development or worldbuilding. Off the top of my head, I can think of three shorter stories that excelled at both—Legion, Moot, and Defending Elysium.\\n\\nAlthough to be fair, the story was told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot who wasn’t overly concerned about the fate of these civilians, so why should we be?\\n\\n“You don’t know who we are? They didn’t tell you?”\\n“There was an info packet in my initial download.” I was still staring out at the heavy green tangle just past the rocks. I really didn’t want to get into how little I paid attention to my job. “I didn’t read it.”\\nArada said, gently, “Why not?”\\nWith all of them staring at me, I couldn’t come up with a good lie. “I didn’t care.”\\n\\nBottom line: Although the narrator was far from a gifted storyteller, the plot was decent enough. But as a heartless killing machine, the poor girl was a terrible failure.\\n\\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #2: ★★★☆☆½\\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #3: ★★★★☆\\nalien-sci-fi\\n \\nnovella\\n \\nthe-final-frontier\\n44 likes\\n16 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

As it turned out though, this little novella was a real treat.\\n\\nTold from the point of a view of a rogue SecUnit—a part organic, part synthetic android designed to provide humans with protection and security services—this story takes readers on a journey to a distant planet being explored by team of scientists. Accompanying them is our protagonist, a self-proclaimed “Murderbot”, whose presence is required by the Company sponsoring the mission. Thing is though, Murderbot doesn’t exactly feel warm and fuzzy towards humans, and it knows that the scientists aren’t too comfortable with having a SecUnit on the team either, given the cagey way they get whenever it’s around.\\n\\nStill, that’s just fine for Murderbot. Having hacked its own governor so that it doesn’t have to follow Company directives, all it wants is to be left alone to enjoy the thousands of hours of entertainment vids that it has downloaded from the humans’ satellites. Of course, no one can suspect that Murderbot is secretly autonomous, so it still has to go about its job like everything is normal, and this arrangement was working out just fine until one day, a routine surface test goes seriously wrong. Murderbot ends up saving the day, earning the admiration and curiosity of the team leader, Dr. Mensah. Soon, Murderbot is left with no choice but to take the lead in defending the scientists, when disaster strikes another neighboring expedition on the planet and threatens to come after them next.\\n\\nHaving read a few of the author’s Raksura novels, I was already familiar with her penchant for throwing readers into the thick of things, leaving them to gradually feel everything out for themselves. Thus I was unsurprised with the way this story opened—by unceremoniously dropping us into Murderbot’s head with hardly any context and minimal background information given. It takes a while to even grasp the kind of protagonist Murderbot is: an artificial entity, albeit a very sentient and self-aware one, complete with personality quirks and a dry sense of humor. While I’ve read plenty of books starring robot protagonists, I can honestly say I’ve never met one quite as unique and interesting as Murderbot. Martha Wells may be tight-fisted when it comes to the details, but she knows exactly how to get your attention. Everything from Murderbot’s anti-social tendencies to its love of cheesy soap operas made me want to keep reading to discover more about the character and why it is telling this story.\\n\\nAt just a little under 150 pages though, and with so much ground to cover, there’s not much opportunity to stop and take a breath. As much as I loved how this book was so snappy and fast-paced, you do have to find your footing quickly or risk getting left behind. This means learning and familiarizing yourself with the characters as soon as they’re introduced, and most of them, like the humans on the science team, are only going to be lightly sketched. This was probably my only criticism; considering how over time, Murderbot comes to see the team as “its humans” and become very protective of them, it would have been helpful to develop those characters a bit more, especially since our protagonist begins this tale by being very disdainful of them.\\n\\nStill, there wasn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about this book. It was entertaining, and more importantly, it also felt complete to me, unlike a lot of novellas that leave me wanting more. Plus, this snarky first-person narrative style is quite different from what I’m used to when it comes to Wells, but I think I could grow to like it! Murderbot’s narration was a joy to follow, and I even found myself chuckling at many of the story’s scenes. Overall, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and I definitely would not hesitate recommending All Systems Red to anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix with a fun and captivating premise. I was excited when I found out this was going to be a series, and I can’t wait to check out the next installment of the Murderbot Diaries.',\n",

The book was a collection of stories that explored humankind’s future with robots. The key robot was R. Daneel Olivaw.\\n\\nYou may recall the three laws of Robotics:\\n1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\\n2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\\n3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\\n\\nThat only works if your robot’s implant hasn’t been hacked. Wells’ robot is good at hacking and has a few deaths in its past. It refers to itself as “Murderbot” but doesn’t share this with the group of humans who it is now responsible for. It is a far cry from R. Daneel Olivaw, but that\\'s part of what makes this \"diary\" so interesting.\\n\\nOur team is on an unexplored planet trying to get to know the geology, geography, flora and fauna. Right off the bat, one of the “fauna” almost kills a member of the crew and our ‘bot barely saves him. The crew is appreciative but all our ‘bot wants to do is be left alone so it can hack into its favorite library of “soap operas.” This has some effect on team dynamics: “Now they knew their murderbot didn’t want to be around them any more than they wanted to be around it. I’d given a tiny piece of myself away. That can’t happen. I have too much to hide, and letting one piece go means the rest isn’t as protected.”\\n\\nWells does a brilliant job of giving us the ‘bot’s perspective and this novella is the start of the series. She shows her usual deft touch with plot and characterization. It will be hard to resist jumping into the next one; particularly with such encouragement from GR friend Carol.\\n39 likes\\n7 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

Half machine and half human (at least, cloned human parts), this particular ‘security unit’ has a chequered past, has hacked its own governor module, and has privately dubbed itself “Murderbot”. Now on contract to a research team assessing a planet, Murderbot has a well defined job to do, but unexpectedly gets attached to the team and goes beyond the job at hand to help them.\\n\\nIt’s a short novella, so there’s not a lot to say that wouldn’t spoil some part or other of it, but I loved the character of Murderbot - the combination of competence and dedication for the job at hand, self knowledge of limitations, and the deep desire to just be left alone to secretly watch as many episodes of the soap opera Sanctuary Moon as possible.\\n\\nI’m so happy that there are 6 more books…\\nread-books-2024\\n \\nspeculative-fiction\\n40 likes\\n17 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

I really enjoyed how the story focused on the relationship between Murderbot and the rest of the crew, causing the reader to think about what it means to be human.\\n\\nThe world itself was interesting, and as a newbie SF reader, I didn’t find any of the tech concepts to be over my head. The story, while relatively short (it is a novella, after all) had several exciting moments.\\n\\nThe best (and most surprising) part was the voice of the narrator; told in first-person POV from the Murderbot’s perspective, I didn’t expect this character to be funny, sarcastic, awkward, and generally self-conscious. But it was all these things, and more. In fact, it’s this character’s personality which really makes the story what it is. I also loved some of the secondary characters, particularly Dr. Mensah.\\n\\nThis is the first in an ongoing series, and it will be exciting to see what happens next.\\n40 likes\\n8 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

       "  'date': \"So What’s It About?\\nIn a corporate-dominated space-faring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. For their own safety, exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.\\n\\nOn a distant planet, a team of scientists is conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid--a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, Murderbot wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is, but when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.\\n\\nWhat I Thought\\n\\nI’ve heard people sing praise to Murderbot for years now, and I’m kind of embarrassed that it took me so long to get on the bandwagon. But I read All Systems Red! Finally! And now I’m bandwaggoned!\\n\\nThis novella is fast-paced, inventive, and clever all throughout.

Granted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\\n\\nShould I be worried? I spent the last three months endlessly watching entertaining feeds and/or raging at stupid people in the news. I might be turning into a murderbot, or maybe I am simply programmed to think I am human, until my secret corporate masters will push the button to activate me. You’d better watch out, there will be mayhem once I go out of quarantine!\\n\\nAll System Red is the first novella in a new science-fiction project that is tightly plotted, fast-paced and funny. A first person narration from a serial killer perspective, our host is a construct of organic and electronic elements, a Security bot assigned to a geological survey team on a recently discovered exoplanet.\\n\\nWe all know, thanks to Isaac Asimov, that robots and artificial intelligence in general are subjected to the Laws of Robotics, the prime directive of which says that they should not harm their human masters. But an artificial intelligence is by definition a software capable of learning, and the one that calls itself Murderbot has taught itself some high level hacker code, enough to disable the governor that enforces the Law of Robotics. In its own defense, the Murderbot is annoyed when put to work for the survey team, preferring instead to watch endless re-runs of popular soap operas in space. Because, you know, anything is better than going back to work!\\n\\nJoking aside, the novella does a great job at setting up the debate of how we define humanity and how we take responsibility for our own actions.\\nI will probably read the next three episodes in the following days, curious to see how free will can deal with deeply entrenched paranoia against armed and dangerous intelligent entities who take a critical view of our society.\\n\\n2020\\n37 likes\\n7 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

That's right, the snarkiness brought to you by John Scalzi and his clones as a substitute for character development doesn't have to stop at witty rejoinders. Now you can get a steady stream of it all book long, in this case courtesy of a Murderbot, which is a Security Robot with a troubled past. It's probably the 'bot character that is causing this brief flurry of irrationally exuberant popularity here at GR. That, and the snarkiness, which is like being dipped into the mind of a sulky teenage girl, but with 100% less Justin Bieber references. Said snarkiness is brought on by the 'bot achieving self-awareness but choosing to watch Netflix and muse snarky thoughts about nearby adults all day instead of going full Skynet. Everybody knows you never go full Skynet. The story is nothing special, but it moves along at a relatively brisk pace, and Wells' color-by-numbers prose is adequate for maximum snarkiness delivery.

I don\\'t have anything particularly bad to say about it and I don\\'t have any positive emotions as well. I would say the entire work is fairly mediocre although I guess the absence of anything I liked is a negative on its own.\\n\\nThis has a lot to do with my own expectations going into this novella as what sold me on the series apart from the overwhelming praise was that it was supposed to be about a killer robot who only wished to watch TV at home and not do what it was intended for. As a premise I find it quite interesting and I was looking for something funny and quirky as such a character can find itself in all kinds of comedic situations and I thought it had potential to be really enjoyable and different.\\n\\nAll that character I was waiting for was completely missing from the entire work and the original selling point of the novel turned out to be represented by the main character uttering \"I want to watch TV\" or some equivalent every 10 pages or so. I feel like I would have had something positive to say if the supporting plot or world was particularly interesting but this wasn\\'t the case as well. It really felt like the author wanted readers to connect to the titular Murderbot first and care about everything else afterwards but since I never passed that checkpoint I felt utterly indifferent to everything else as well.\\n2021-reads\\n \\nsci-fi\\n36 likes\\n2 comments\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

Things go awry, and Murderbot has to save the day. Preferably without murdering.\\n\\nI did enjoy the story, and I can see why MB is so beloved. It's a funny, sassy lil thing and it's easy to agree with. Its shyness is endearing and we have no trouble reading between the lines when it comes to its personality.\\n\\nThe story jumps into the action pretty quickly and it doesn't really let up so this is certainly an easy read.\\n\\nHowever, because it's a short story there's not a lot of world building, and because there's not a lot of world building it can be a little hard to follow at times with all the names for things and organisations we know nothing about, and the lack of names for the things we do encounter. I admit I got a little lost in the jargon and politics.\\n\\nI really loved the crew and how they all related to MB. They added a much needed humanity to the story so it will be interesting to see where the next book in the story takes the series.\\n\\nI enjoyed it for the most part but it didn't really match the hype for me. Still, a fun, quick read with a host of great characters. I'll look into the next one just to see where it goes.\\nsci-fi\\n40 likes\\n6 comments\\nLike\\nComment\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Dirk Grobbelaar\\n854 reviews\\n1,228 followers\\nFollow\\nMarch 7, 2022\\nWell this is a really pointless review. If you like Science Fiction you have heard of this already, and you have either read it or you are going to read it. It\\'s been popping up in all my recommendations for a while now, and with cover art as awesome as that, it really was only a matter of time.\\n\\nNow, full disclosure: the one reason I was initially skittish about reading this, is because it is a novella. That shouldn\\'t matter, and it likely doesn\\'t (to just about everybody else), but for some reason I have always preferred novel length stories.\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s neither here nor there. This book made a significant impact. It was nominated for just about every Science Fiction award you can quickly think of and it won the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards (for best novella).\\n\\nAnd yes, it is totally worth it. This story of a security bot who has hacked its own governing module (thereby giving itself access to free choice) is fun and moves really quickly. There are some cool reveals about \"Murderbot\" and its past, as well as an intriguing final act that will have you wanting to read the sequels.\\n\\nI have subtracted a star because the story is sparse on detail and limited in scope (some reviewers have been likening it to a YA novel, but it is also perhaps in order to keep it to novella length). It reads quick as hell though, so even if it isn\\'t your cup of tea it won\\'t be time wasted. That said, it\\'s hard for me to imagine anybody not enjoying this.\\n\\nI\\'m glad to see there are sequels - although I do hope that at least some of them are full novels.\\nacquired-in-2022\\n \\nbooks-i-own\\n \\nhugo-award-winners\\n \\n...more\\n35 likes\\n1 comment\\nLike\\nComment'},\n",

Too cheesy for my taste.\\n\\nIf in a fantasy work I welcome cheesy stuff (if it’s not too much), in a sci-fi one I expect the “what if” to surprise me with ideas and worldbuilding. I just don’t care about an emotional bot who/which watches soap opera...\\n\\nI guess I already have three ‘robots’ on a pedestal and it’s hard for another to rise up to them: Reynolds’ Hesperus, Asimov’s R. Daneel Olivaw and Herbert’s Erasmus.\\n\\nSo, if you like a mystery case on a faraway planet, then this is for you.

I’m not especially fond of novellas. This one, though…\\n\\nI can’t even really explain what appealed to me about this novella: Murderbot neither really feels like a robot nor like a person but still strangely… plausible.\\nMurderbot’s actions feel logical, yet simple. It does what it has to do. Its ambiguity as an artificial lifeform makes it feel both familiar in, e. g. its shyness and some other emotions - not to speak of its entertainment addiction.\\nPlus: An artificial lifeform that (sometimes) acts more humanely than its human counterparts? Fascinating!\\n\\nMurderbot is literally strange enough to go through a contrasting melange of emotions as well. This contrast, the SecUnit's conflicting feelings and survival strategies are probably what made this story so wondrously attractive for me.\\n\\nAll in all, the novella is based on an interesting premise with a good mixture of characters and a lot of suspense. Spice that up with Murderbot itself and its diverse clients and you get a modern, fresh approach to science fiction.\\n\\nHighly recommended.\\n\\n\\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\\n0_wk_read_2020\\n \\nfavorites\\n34 likes\\n1 comment\\nLike\\nComment\"}]"
