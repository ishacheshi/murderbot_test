THE WRITING IS MEDIOCRE SHIT TOO.\\n\\nBarely any description about what the technology actually looks like. There is also no description on the settings either. There were other things I hated, but the story having no description was the worst part.\\n\\nThe main character is a murderbot that has social anxiety. It\\'s not done in a relatable way at all. \"Omg they hate me because I\\'m a robot\". It\\'s just said over and over again that the main character feels awkward around humans.\\n\\nLater on the story points out that since the main character is a robot it has no gender and doesn\\'t care about sex. Again there\\'s a whole paragraph on this and it doesn\\'t feel naturally integrated into the story at all. \"Look I\\'m trying to be diverse\". Yeah it\\'s a robot of course it doesn\\'t have to have a gender. Another thing is that the main character reads actually like a girl so this whole gender neutral thing is not working out. I\\'m not actually sure what a murderbot is yet, but I\\'m not reading the whole thing to find out.\\n1-star\\n \\ndnf\\n119 likes\\n22 comments\\nLike\\nComment'}\n",
