This was awesome, introducing an immediately likeable lead while packing in cool world-building, creepy tension, and exciting action scenes, all within about 150 pages.\n\nI immediately clicked with the main character's vibe, a deadly for-hire security robot that's secretly overridden its company's ability to control it, primarily using that freedom to quietly binge-watch television dramas during its downtime. The writing has a lot of fun with character's mindset, with the robot mildly annoyed by and uncomfortable around the humans it still genuinely wants to protect.\n\nHighly enjoyable! I'll certainly come back for more.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

It's a simple plot and the entire action is described from the perspective of a bored robot tasked with caring for a group of scientists on an unexplored planet. The robot finds it difficult to interact with people, to understand their motives, while at the same time slowly developing a genuine care and affection towards its fragile humans. This is like reading about a feral cat: only there because it has to be there, hates everyone, wants to be left alone, except wait maybe not everything is SO bad.

At best, it reads like fanfiction, yet I've read plenty of fanfiction that works much harder at being entertaining than this.\n\nI thought Murderbot (both the character and the book) was supposed to be unique, quirky, droll.

It’s a must-read if you enjoy sci-fi that makes you think about AI consciousness.

This is a great introduction novella which provides enough information regarding society and technology to not be confusing but not too much to become too technically dense. Our Murderbot main character is a socially awkward, exasperated and reluctant participant in his job who would rather be laying in his cubicle watching tv than dealing with those around him #relatable.

It became uncannily easy to understand the machine's thought processes and choices and root for the seemingly cold, distant machine designed to murder.\nTurns out the metal assassin you're flying with isn't calculating how to murder you, but disassociating and trying to watch their stories on the work hour.\n\nThis was a witty, fast-paced, intriguing, and action packed sci-fi story that was able to trust the audiences with their characters and plot without any filler, extraneous exposition, or dizzying world building.\n\nAn infinitesimal, personal complaint about the audiobook...almost wished the reader was British. Hearing an American voice say \"solicitor\" when referring to lawyers and legal aides took me out of the story MUCH easier than it should have.

Nothing but a teenage overly dramatic drama queen of an android filled with nothing but self-pity and only capable of whinging for more than half the book. the prose was garbage until chapter 5 (just over half the book! it's only 8 chapters!) when the fucking irritating android finally started talking to people and not just crying in its fucking beer. the only decent chapters were 5, 6 and 7 and they weren't good. the ending, chapter 8, was so abrupt, hamfisted, stupid and incredibly lazy. I was shocked. absolutely shocked it had ended worse than it started. Clearly the author was asleep at the wheel for 4 whole chapters, snorted a pound of cocaine to power through 3 more chapters and ran outer printer paper so she cranked out the ending on half a sheet of paper while hallucinating on salvia and speed! Clearly her publishing deadline was in 10 ten minutes or less effort would have been put in. Dear friend who asked me to read this because it's a favorite...

I actually think I liked the TV version better because they elaborated more on Sanctuary Moon. I still really enjoyed the book though. Only reason for 4 stars is it was hard to follow for me. I am new to Sci Fi books, but I didn’t get a clear picture as to who the ‘company’ was, plus other terms like the all the different Hubs or the little pod they were traveling in. Sometimes I almost felt like he went one way of thinking and then backtracked to before that thought and I got confused a couple of times and had to re-read some pages. Also, what were the humans doing on that planet, and what were they searching for? Why did Murderbot kill those people before he got reprogrammed? I needed more details, and that’s why I liked the show because it filled in some of the gaps for me, and I would have been way more lost if I hadn’t seen it. I loved Murderbot’s personality though.

(I assess the threat)\nWe execute the plan. (In three long corporate cycles.)\nWe move on.\nAnd yes, most of the time, the threat is human behavior.\n\nThen it’s over.

Murderbot is a rogue security robot who has overridden his programming to allow himself to make decisions of his own, and most importantly, watch TV and movies. He literally wants nothing more than to be left alone and to not have to deal with humans, which is ironic seeing as his exact job is to protect humans that he is assigned to. He finds emotions annoying, admits to half assing work, thinks humans are dumb and has funny commentary on all the little social routines/oddities humans all do for the sake of pleasantry and going through the motions.\n\nThis book also had a crazy amount of plot and world building for a novella! Super fun tech, lots of action and I would definitely see myself continuing the series on car trips.\n\nIs it a crazy stand out impressive story?

I loved the concept, and I can absolutely see why so many people adore Murderbot as a character.\n\nThat said, the execution didn’t fully work for me. The novella format felt too short for the amount of worldbuilding and emotional depth I wanted. Things moved quickly, but not in a way that kept me hooked—instead, I was often waiting for the story to really start. Murderbot’s voice is clever and funny, but I didn’t quite connect enough to feel fully invested in the stakes.\n\nStill, I’m curious to see where the series goes and will be continuing it—Murderbot’s unique perspective has me intrigued enough to give the next installment a try.\n\nA 2-star read for me: interesting ideas and moments of humor, but ultimately not quite as immersive as I hoped.\n\n✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧\nLike\nComment"}

I saw exactly zero redeeming qualities within its pages.\n\nMurderbot wasn't funny or charming, but rather just sort of lazy and anxious. At no point did I care about the events on that planet. Let's break down the entire story: some greedy buggers tried to kill the main characters, murderbot was there. Then it's all over. I had the beginnings of a glimmer of caring when I thought the crew would not trust MB after they learned more about him. But, no, that wasn't a problem.\n\nToo many characters! No idea how many, it boiled down to the boss and the guy MB didn't like. And all the rest.\n\nLet me tell you about the universe where this all happens. Well, there is a corporation and it's cheap. That's about all we know.\n\nThe prose is godawful. \"I walked here. I picked up something. I walked there.\"\n\nThis book is freakishly popular, and I just don't get it.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-09", "text": "READERSBEWARE\n171 reviews\nFollow\nDecember 9, 2025\nReading All Systems Red felt like slipping into the mind of someone who’s already given up on being understood. Murderbot’s voice is sardonic, numb, and strangely heartbreaking — a creature built for violence, wired for obedience, yet quietly desperate to disappear into the comforting static of its media feeds. The isolation hits hardest: it moves through the world surrounded by people it’s meant to protect, yet it never believes it belongs beside them. That loneliness, wrapped in humor sharp enough to border on self-defense, makes the story feel less like sci-fi adventure and more like a confession from someone who never asked to exist.\n\nWhat lingers isn’t the danger the characters face but the way Murderbot constantly assumes the worst of itself. Every time it steps between humans and harm, there’s this sense of weary inevitability — like it’s bracing for the moment its usefulness runs out. Its internal monologue reads like someone trying to shrink out of their own story, terrified of being seen, yet unable to stop caring in the small, reluctant ways that hurt the most. Even when the plot accelerates into tense survival, that low thrum of self-loathing never really fades; it just hides under the action beats.\n\nBy the end, the book doesn’t offer comfort so much as a grim acknowledgment of what it means to keep going when connection feels dangerous and identity feels like a wound. The story is short, almost brutally so, and it leaves you with the sense that Murderbot’s journey is far from healing — it’s merely the first step of someone who knows freedom won’t magically make them whole. And maybe that’s what makes this little novella so quietly devastating: beneath the armor, the algorithms, and the dry humor, Murderbot feels painfully human in its desire to stay unseen… and its inability to stop caring anyway.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

There are no stakes, nothing that makes me care about what might happen, nothing that makes me want to keep reading. I am so confused how this won awards and has such a high rating. Did I get a bad copy or did everyone who gave this five stars read the same drivel as I did?\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

I couldn't put this down and will be reading the entire series without a doubt. Murderbot is already becoming a top ten character for me. I can see why it was made into a TV show, especially with the rise of AI in the world and with good reasoning, because this story was a blast.\nLike\nComment"}

It prefers staying behind its mask or talking through cameras rather than making eye contact with its human clients. Its uncomfortable talking and interacting with them and prefers to stay in its room watching TV shows. Unlike other units of its type, it does not need to obey commands thanks to it hacking its governor module.\n\nUnfortunately, it would seem someone does not want them on that planet. Its an intriguing premise and good character. However, it was a little grating reading through all the self-deprecating jokes and mild sarcasm.\nLike\nComment"}

Sometimes they are sent to murder humans that are doing things the secunit's operator doesn't like.\n\nMurderbot hacked its controlling module and now does the same job as before, but mostly just hopes the job will be boring and it can watch media instead of spending time with the stupid humans.\n\nSadly something may be trying to kill its current clients and while it hates its job, Murderbot isn't going to let that happen.\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}
