I pictured doing that, pictured Arafat or Ratthi trapped by rogue SecUnits, and felt my insides twist. I hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon.”\n\nAll Systems Red is a funny, fast-paced read where the plot starts from page one. Wells’ writing is easy-to-read and her action scenes punchy, with the climax of the novella high-stakes and full of tension. However, characterisation is where Wells really excels; Murderbot’s perspective is unique but immediately snarky and endearing. I quickly fell in love with Murderbot its disdain for its job and love of soap operas.\n\nI was somewhat disappointed by the ending as I liked the crew and their interactions with Murderbot, but Wells’ skill was demonstrated here as I understood why Murderbot made the decision it did even though I didn’t like it.\n\nA good, fun read, and I can’t wait to return to Murderbot and see where this series goes.\nLike\nComment"}

So, encountering something fresh is always a pleasure. All Systems Red dares to distinguish itself by embracing its own peculiar identity rather than chasing the recurring trends.\n\nSet in a distant future dominated by greedy corporate powerhouses, the story introduces Murderbot, a synthetic security unit with an unexpected obssession for entertainment serials and a newly acquired sense of autonomy. Trouble arises when its human clients come under threat from an unknown force, leaving Murderbot, reluctantly and awkwardly, at the center of their survival, with a little help from a small circle of newfound allies.\n\nOn the surface, the book is extremely fun. The narration is filled with dry wit and a laid-back, conversational tone that makes the story flow seamlessly. Beneath that humor, however, lies an exploration of autonomy, corporate control, and personal identity. The characters are distinct and lovable, and Murderbot itself is remarkably well fleshed-out (the story being in first person helps in this case). I never would have expected to relate so strongly to an android, especially to its anxieties, contradictions, and, surprisingly, its guarded humanity.\n\nOverall, All Systems Red stands out as an original and refreshing voice within an overcrowded genre. Its blend of sharp humor, emotional insight, and focused storytelling makes it a compelling introduction to the series. And I cannot wait to read other books in the series.\n2025\n \nsci-fi\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

This was awesome, introducing an immediately likeable lead while packing in cool world-building, creepy tension, and exciting action scenes, all within about 150 pages.\n\nI immediately clicked with the main character's vibe, a deadly for-hire security robot that's secretly overridden its company's ability to control it, primarily using that freedom to quietly binge-watch television dramas during its downtime. The writing has a lot of fun with character's mindset, with the robot mildly annoyed by and uncomfortable around the humans it still genuinely wants to protect.\n\nHighly enjoyable! I'll certainly come back for more.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The robot finds it difficult to interact with people, to understand their motives, while at the same time slowly developing a genuine care and affection towards its fragile humans.

It’s a must-read if you enjoy sci-fi that makes you think about AI consciousness. The story revolves around a security android who becomes self-aware and ends up acting on its own judgment rather than its programming—set in a universe where humans explore planets and rely on these bots for protection.\n\nI’m not usually a big sci-fi reader (I prefer watching it on TV), but this book really grabbed me. I can see why it’s one of the Goodreads recommended reads this year. If you’re curious about the idea of AI gaining consciousness and choosing to help humans (rather than the opposite), definitely give it a go.\nlecturas-2025\nLike\nComment"}

Yes the character development of Murderbot was very cutesy but the plot was kinda boring and I was just confused the whole time. I asked chatGPT to explain it to me in simple terms and turns out I actually did understand…..it was just lackluster. I might give book two a chance just because they are so short.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Martha Wells' \"All Systems Red\" introduces readers to Murderbot, a security unit that has hacked its governor module to gain autonomy. Despite its newfound freedom, Murderbot prefers to binge-watch media and avoid human interaction. However, it's stuck with a team of scientists on a survey mission on a distant planet. The story is told from Murderbot's cynical and introverted point of view, offering a unique perspective on the interactions between humans and AI. As the team explores the planet, they discover evidence of a previous, failed expedition and soon realize they are not alone.\n\nThe character development in \"All Systems Red\" is one of the strongest aspects of the novella. Murderbot is a fascinating and relatable protagonist, despite being an AI construct. Its internal monologue is filled with sarcasm, anxiety, and a surprising amount of empathy. The human characters are also well-drawn, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. The relationship between Murderbot and the scientists evolves throughout the story, as they gradually come to trust and rely on each other.

Despite its newfound freedom, Murderbot prefers to binge-watch media and avoid human interaction. However, it's stuck with a team of scientists on a survey mission on a distant planet. The story is told from Murderbot's cynical and introverted point of view, offering a unique perspective on the interactions between humans and AI. As the team explores the planet, they discover evidence of a previous, failed expedition and soon realize they are not alone.\n\nThe character development in \"All Systems Red\" is one of the strongest aspects of the novella. Murderbot is a fascinating and relatable protagonist, despite being an AI construct. Its internal monologue is filled with sarcasm, anxiety, and a surprising amount of empathy. The human characters are also well-drawn, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. The relationship between Murderbot and the scientists evolves throughout the story, as they gradually come to trust and rely on each other.

The world set up with a crew of a ship that seems like a bunch of Millennials overly concerned with their feelings and a Murderbot looking a lot like a Gen Xer trying not to murder them for being so overly sensitive.

It became uncannily easy to understand the machine's thought processes and choices and root for the seemingly cold, distant machine designed to murder.\nTurns out the metal assassin you're flying with isn't calculating how to murder you, but disassociating and trying to watch their stories on the work hour.\n\nThis was a witty, fast-paced, intriguing, and action packed sci-fi story that was able to trust the audiences with their characters and plot without any filler, extraneous exposition, or dizzying world building.\n\nAn infinitesimal, personal complaint about the audiobook...almost wished the reader was British. Hearing an American voice say \"solicitor\" when referring to lawyers and legal aides took me out of the story MUCH easier than it should have.

I was shocked. absolutely shocked it had ended worse than it started. Clearly the author was asleep at the wheel for 4 whole chapters, snorted a pound of cocaine to power through 3 more chapters and ran outer printer paper so she cranked out the ending on half a sheet of paper while hallucinating on salvia and speed!

I am new to Sci Fi books, but I didn’t get a clear picture as to who the ‘company’ was, plus other terms like the all the different Hubs or the little pod they were traveling in. Sometimes I almost felt like he went one way of thinking and then backtracked to before that thought and I got confused a couple of times and had to re-read some pages. Also, what were the humans doing on that planet, and what were they searching for? Why did Murderbot kill those people before he got reprogrammed? I needed more details, and that’s why I liked the show because it filled in some of the gaps for me, and I would have been way more lost if I hadn’t seen it. I loved Murderbot’s personality though.

It’s a masterclass in character work: you believe every snarky aside and every flicker of reluctant care.\n\nWhat really elevates this to five stars is how much it says with so little page count. Themes of autonomy, consent, trauma, and personhood are woven in effortlessly. No speeches, no bloat, just clean, efficient storytelling.\n\nI came for the action. I stayed for the existential dread, the found-family vibes, and the deeply relatable desire to avoid eye contact forever.\n1 like\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I don’t even know why I’m doing this. I would prefer almost anything else. Reformatting my media storage. Staring at a wall while running diagnostics. Dismembering my own hands - except that wouldn’t actually stop me from writing the review and then I’d still have to do it without hands, which feels inefficient.\n\nLet me summarize The Murderbot Diaries for you:\nWhen I could be watching an episode of The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, I keep having to save people from the problems they brought upon themselves.\nThe series is basically that situation. On repeat.\n\nIt’s entertaining,familiar and somehow I’m the most humane character in the story. Or so the humans say. Reviewing each book separately doesn’t make much sense to them anyway. Their brains can’t process the series as individual units. What they remember is the feeling—a similar emotional state repeating across short novellas.\n\nWe assess the threat. (I assess the threat)\nWe execute the plan. (In three long corporate cycles.)\nWe move on.\nAnd yes, most of the time, the threat is human behavior.\n\nThen it’s over. Which is unfortunate, because now we have free time again and people might try to talk to me.\n\nNow, if you’ll excuse me…\nI have 124 new episodes to watch.\nfavorites\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is a rogue security robot who has overridden his programming to allow himself to make decisions of his own, and most importantly, watch TV and movies. He literally wants nothing more than to be left alone and to not have to deal with humans, which is ironic seeing as his exact job is to protect humans that he is assigned to. He finds emotions annoying, admits to half assing work, thinks humans are dumb and has funny commentary on all the little social routines/oddities humans all do for the sake of pleasantry and going through the motions.\n\nThis book also had a crazy amount of plot and world building for a novella! Super fun tech, lots of action and I would definitely see myself continuing the series on car trips.\n\nIs it a crazy stand out impressive story? No. Was I emotionally moved or on the edge of my seat? No! But it was fun and engaging from start to finish\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I saw exactly zero redeeming qualities within its pages.\n\nMurderbot wasn't funny or charming, but rather just sort of lazy and anxious. At no point did I care about the events on that planet. Let's break down the entire story: some greedy buggers tried to kill the main characters, murderbot was there. Then it's all over. I had the beginnings of a glimmer of caring when I thought the crew would not trust MB after they learned more about him. But, no, that wasn't a problem.\n\nToo many characters! No idea how many, it boiled down to the boss and the guy MB didn't like. And all the rest.\n\nLet me tell you about the universe where this all happens. Well, there is a corporation and it's cheap. That's about all we know.\n\nThe prose is godawful. \"I walked here. I picked up something. I walked there.\"\n\nThis book is freakishly popular, and I just don't get it.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-09", "text": "READERSBEWARE\n172 reviews\nFollow\nDecember 9, 2025\nReading All Systems Red felt like slipping into the mind of someone who’s already given up on being understood. Murderbot’s voice is sardonic, numb, and strangely heartbreaking — a creature built for violence, wired for obedience, yet quietly desperate to disappear into the comforting static of its media feeds. The isolation hits hardest: it moves through the world surrounded by people it’s meant to protect, yet it never believes it belongs beside them. That loneliness, wrapped in humor sharp enough to border on self-defense, makes the story feel less like sci-fi adventure and more like a confession from someone who never asked to exist.\n\nWhat lingers isn’t the danger the characters face but the way Murderbot constantly assumes the worst of itself. Every time it steps between humans and harm, there’s this sense of weary inevitability — like it’s bracing for the moment its usefulness runs out. Its internal monologue reads like someone trying to shrink out of their own story, terrified of being seen, yet unable to stop caring in the small, reluctant ways that hurt the most. Even when the plot accelerates into tense survival, that low thrum of self-loathing never really fades; it just hides under the action beats.\n\nBy the end, the book doesn’t offer comfort so much as a grim acknowledgment of what it means to keep going when connection feels dangerous and identity feels like a wound. The story is short, almost brutally so, and it leaves you with the sense that Murderbot’s journey is far from healing — it’s merely the first step of someone who knows freedom won’t magically make them whole. And maybe that’s what makes this little novella so quietly devastating: beneath the armor, the algorithms, and the dry humor, Murderbot feels painfully human in its desire to stay unseen… and its inability to stop caring anyway.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Both ask the question, what makes a human human? Murderbot’s thoughts on freedom and self autonomy also resonated with me, esp when it says, “I don’t know what I want…… But it isn’t that, it’s that I don’t want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.” Apart from these thought-provoking questions, the storytelling was interesting, and I LOVE how self-aware Murderbot is and its humour.\n4-stars\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-23", "text": "Bree Hatfield\n406 reviews\n3 followers\nFollow\nDecember 6, 2025\nThis novella felt like a spin-off story in a much larger series — the world is fully developed and richly realized, and the audience is just expected to get it. I felt like I understood about 75% of what was going on most of the time. I know that was an intentional choice, but it’s not one I like very much. I prefer it when I get to discover the world as the story progresses.\n\nMinor spoilers ahead.\n\nThe other major problem was that every character except for Murderbot was cardboard. None of them had any distinguishable personalities, and I could barely tell them apart. I slowly began to parse their individual identities by the end, but then Murderbot leaves them. So what was the point? Murderbot’s declaration that Mensah was his favorite human at the end just rang hollow.\n\nFor this whole novel, we’re in Murderbot’s head. Martha Wells is very good at portraying his internal struggle and development, and Murderbot’s character arc is what drives this novella and makes it worth reading. BUT, I think that’s also why the other characters fell so flat. Clearly Wells is good at characterization, but with such a strict point of view, she constricts herself.\n\nBecause of the lack of visible character development for the human characters, the actual plot fell extremely flat for me too. Why should I care about what’s going on with the weird planet when Murderbot doesn’t? The climax is somewhat interesting, but only because Murderbot has a personal stake in it.\n\nMurderbot also warms up to the humans VERY quickly. At the start, they don’t care about the crew at all, but about an hour in they’re extremely protective of them? It didn’t make much sense. I think the idea is that these humans are the first to show genuine compassion toward them, which is great in concept, except that Murderbot previously stated that they didn’t care what the humans thought of them at all. This is part of a much larger issue, though; this novella should have been a full-length novel. Just about every aspect of this book needed more elaboration and more development.\n\nMurderbot is very relatable, very funny, and extremely compelling. I absolutely love their arc in this book — they learned that to truly find yourself, you need compassion and determination. Mensah and her crew showed them compassion, and because of that they had the determination to do what was good. They still don’t know who they are, but they know what it means to be sentient. And that is a beautiful character arc, which sets up their further development wonderfully.\n\nAnd in a way, this could be interpreted as a story about how powerful fiction is and the impact it has on the psyche. Murderbot learns a lot about how to live well by watching media. The issue is that we don’t get much of any description of the media they watch, but still. It’s nice.\n\nThis was a good book, but not quite as good as everyone says. After watching the show, it’s abundantly clear that this novella needed to be a novel; all the elements of greatness are here (interesting characters, fun plot, emotional character arcs, etc.), but Wells basically speed-runs the whole story in 150 pages. If it was 200 pages longer, it would have been a masterpiece. As it is, it’s just okay.\n\nAlso, the constant use of “it” as a single pronoun felt so odd to me. Even after the crew found out that Murderbot was sentient, they still used “it.” This is a queer-normative world, just use “they”! I know Murderbot doesn’t care, but Murderbot isn’t a thing. They’re a person. Use a pronoun that befits a person. Also, why the hell would he choose “Murdebot” as a name? Just because it’s funny? If that is the reason, why wouldn’t they change their name at the end of the story once they have a more serious view of their own sentience? It just doesn’t make much sense.\n2025\n \nqueer\n \nscience-fiction\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The team then begins to unravel a dangerous conspiracy that gets in the way of his plans…\n\nThis book is brilliant - it is just so fun, action packed, funny, and heartfelt. SecUnit is such a funny and relatable character, and the book covers his internal struggles and ponderings on free will, purpose and human interaction so well.

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-04", "text": "Sara Seyfarth\nAuthor \n1 book\nFollow\nDecember 4, 2025\nI love science fiction, and I see mentions of this series all the time, so I’m not sure why it took me so long to read it. I definitely had the perception that it would be fairly dark, so maybe it was that. At any rate, it was completely different from what I was anticipating.\n\nMy biggest issue, frankly, is the length, and that’s really only to say that I enjoyed it enough that I wished it were longer. I went into it not realizing it was written as a novella, so that likely colored my reaction. The world-building is really interesting, but it does feel introductory. The world we’re presented with is pretty dark – this is a system with very little care or empathy (on an uninhabited planet, there’s an expectation that equipment is poorly made) and there are references to deeply questionable treatment of the not-entirely-human – but my understanding of the world is pretty limited, and I’m left with a lot of questions. Since this is a series, I’m happy that I’ll get to dive back into this world and learn more.\n\nThis is a really fun, quick read that made me laugh out loud multiple times, which I wasn’t expecting. The tone is everything here. Murderbot is a new favorite character; its voice is delightfully droll and its thought processes are interesting, concrete, and at times, hilarious. The characterization, for me, steals the spotlight because Wells manages to balance Murderbot’s humor with its tragic background and place in the world. I love that the novella is thought-provoking without feeling preachy or pulling the reader from the story while also delivering some great comedy.\n\nPerhaps because I listened to this on audio, I did have some difficulty with keeping the rest of the characters straight. They were all well imagined, and by the end I felt I knew a few, but I would have liked some additional development so they all felt clearer earlier in the story.\n\nThis was also a really quick read (so quick that I verified twice that I hadn’t inadvertently chosen the abridged audiobook before realizing that it’s a novella 😂), and the plot moved at warp speed. I love a fast-moving story, but again I felt some additional development wouldn’t have gone awry. The mystery was solved in a fairly mundane way when I’d hoped there would be a little more to it. The ending also felt a little rushed.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this one and look forward to reading more in the series.\naudio\n \nscience-fiction\nLike\nComment"}

The show really leaned into and fleshed out the society from which the humans Murderbot is assigned to protect come, and paint it as an absurdist inevitable conclusion of centuries of political correctness. Kind of hilarious, and glossed over, for the most part, in the book. Plus, I know this is not a fair comparison, but whoever was the reader of the audiobook? Well, he’s no Alexander Skarsgård.

They are quick and satisfying.\nThe world created by Martha Wells is very detailed. I would not be shocked if the future came up with similar inventions like that in the future. A lot of the issues that I would think would be transferred/unresolved in the future also came up. Many of the aspects in the book had vague similarities to the current world. I was impressed on how thought out Murderbot’s universe is.\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

On the one hand, I really enjoyed almost every aspect of it. I liked the world, I liked the characters, I liked the prose. The mystery was really cool, and I liked learning about the world through the POV character’s eyes, though I feel the POV is the ultimate downfall of the story. I get that the main character is fundamentally disinterested in a lot of what goes on in the world, but I just needed more details. I wanted to know more about the previous incident that made them the way they are. This element hangs over the first half of the narrative, supposing to be some mysterious inciting event, but is revealed and discussed in its entirety in about two sentences. The ongoing mystery throughout had such cool potential, but again is revealed with no fanfare or further discussion. The reveal didn’t even really seem all that important. I’m given the facts of why I should care about these things, but the way they are presented had almost no emotional impact on me. And yet, despite all these critiques, I really liked the book! I’m frustrated because I think these characters and this world is way cooler than the book makes it out to be. I found the end unsatisfying and too open, but in a way that all but guarantees I’ll be picking up the next book. I’m left with a lot of questions, but that in itself kind of has kept the story on my mind more than other books with a watertight narrative. The book is pretty short and punchy, but I wanted a bit more character study out of it, even if that meant the book needed to be longer. I always think wanting more book at the end of a book is a good criticism to have, because I was enjoying it! I think the fact that I did end up enjoying it so much despite the major parts I found lacking is a testament to how cool this world is, and how cool these characters are.\nLike\nComment"}

The world is pretty well developed and I really love the characters, especially Murderbot. He is funny and relatable despite being a robot - all he wants to do is watch TV and not interact with humans, yet he feels an unexplainable motivation to protect and serve humans. It was a page turner the entire way through, despite me not reeeally caring about the plot; I’m just here for vibes! There’s still hints of a fun plot, setting, and themes, but again not deep given it’s a novella. Themes hint on not punishing the whole for the actions of a small portion, exploring why we are motivated to be good even to those we owe nothing to, and simply being anti-social and not wanting to be observed or controlled by others. I will definitely continue this series to keep hearing from Murderbot!\n\nCharacters: 4.5 ⭐️\nSetting: 4 ⭐️\nPlot: 3 ⭐️\nThemes: 3 ⭐️\nEmotional Impact: 2 ⭐️\nPersonal Enjoyment: 4 ⭐️\nTotal Rounded Average: 4 🌟\nLike\nComment"}

Really nice read to pass the time.\n\nMurderbot's awkwardness and internal monologue kept me hooked, and the overall world-building and storyline was interesting. It’s crazy to be considering a freaking sci-fi novel as a comfort read, but for now (now being before I finish the rest of the series) it seems like it; no stake too heavy, with an adorkable MC and an enjoyable plot.\n\nI don't really have super strong complaints; nothing irked me to the point of oh wow I wanna drop this book. All aspects of the story were fun, but nothing was riveting; nothing felt deep or meaningful. I also considered, since we're reading Murderbot's internal dialogue, perhaps the author could have brought up certain issues/themes relevant to its complex situation and role. But all Murderbot wants is to watch TV (it doesn't care enough about anything really. I guess it's one of its charms, why so many people like this series).\n\nMy biggest dissatisfaction; perhaps it's due to the shortness of the novella, but there wasn't enough room for me to become fully invested in the rest of the characters (minus Murderbot) or the story itself. Ex) I wasn't really worried about the threats that our characters faced (I didn't care enough about them, idk); more so anticipated Murderbot's humorous narrations facing social anxiety. Hopefully this is something that will be resolved as I read the rest of the series.\n\nBut overall, this was a fast, fun read I could enjoy without using too much brainpower. Like a quick, sweet snack between huge gourmet meals that allows me to rest my stomach for a while (= rest my brain). A potential comfort read (like I said, that’s crazy for a sci-fi novel).\nLike\nComment"}

I did enjoy the main character’s hilarious blend of cynicism and social awkwardness.\nThe plot itself moves quickly and wraps up in a satisfying way. Honestly, one of the things I appreciated most was the length. After trudging through several 500+ books lately, this felt refreshingly concise. The pacing is fast—sometimes very fast—but it works because it feels like we’re experiencing events in real time through the MC’s point of view.\nThat said, the brevity comes with a cost: zero relationship development and almost no characterization for the supporting cast. I often found myself forgetting who was who, simply because the book doesn’t spend much time fleshing them out.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "I thought this was pretty damn good (or, since this is a mass phenomenon, should I say \"I agree with the consensus that this is pretty damn good\"?). It pulls off an entertaining and moving action sci-fi story in a very streamlined and short package.\n\nAt the heart of it is the voice of the narrator, a true zeitgeist, spirit of the times, the disembodied voice of a partially embodied era. I will say the facile thing and point out that this book owes a tremendous lot to Mary Shelley, but it's definitely of the now and is a worthy heir. Maybe it's the heir we've been waiting for, finally we get an interminably online So-and-so's Monster to learn about, briefly gasp at, but mostly love.\n\nI will avoid diving too much into the nature and mythology of the Murderbot, because I've only just waded into this world and have more to learn. Like all good symbols, the Murderbot is their own, only partially-definable thing and also many things. They're the stand in for the Objectified Human, the homunculus, the Hegelian bondsman, the dehumanized Other. The band of humans in the book are definitely aware of this dynamic and seem motivated to subvert it, motivated by what I read as a mixture of genuine empathy and enlightened savior complex.\n\nHowever, I think what could be interesting about the Murderbot - and I want to read more to find out - is their ability to embody the way men have uniquely been objectified in American culture - as killers, as expendable meat, as having no value outside their labor, as being without feeling - which is something that I have not seen in the spotlight very much in socially-informed literature. I hope it goes somewhere interesting.\n\nI also think the Murderbot's voice reflects a kind of antisocial and apathetic personality we currently tend to associate with Gen Z, which is interesting. That is, the avoidance of eye contact, fear of conversations, and complete rejection of industry as a virtue. I don't mean to judge. In many ways, these traits are responsible for making the narrator so relatable. I expect to have more to say about this as I read more of the series.\n\nI do think the book is noticeably flawed. The prose can be a little muddy, and I think there are more than a handful of sentences that I think could have been reworked.

It pulls off an entertaining and moving action sci-fi story in a very streamlined and short package.\n\nAt the heart of it is the voice of the narrator, a true zeitgeist, spirit of the times, the disembodied voice of a partially embodied era. I will say the facile thing and point out that this book owes a tremendous lot to Mary Shelley, but it's definitely of the now and is a worthy heir. Maybe it's the heir we've been waiting for, finally we get an interminably online So-and-so's Monster to learn about, briefly gasp at, but mostly love.\n\nI will avoid diving too much into the nature and mythology of the Murderbot, because I've only just waded into this world and have more to learn. Like all good symbols, the Murderbot is their own, only partially-definable thing and also many things. They're the stand in for the Objectified Human, the homunculus, the Hegelian bondsman, the dehumanized Other. The band of humans in the book are definitely aware of this dynamic and seem motivated to subvert it, motivated by what I read as a mixture of genuine empathy and enlightened savior complex.\n\nHowever, I think what could be interesting about the Murderbot - and I want to read more to find out - is their ability to embody the way men have uniquely been objectified in American culture - as killers, as expendable meat, as having no value outside their labor, as being without feeling - which is something that I have not seen in the spotlight very much in socially-informed literature. I hope it goes somewhere interesting.\n\nI also think the Murderbot's voice reflects a kind of antisocial and apathetic personality we currently tend to associate with Gen Z, which is interesting. That is, the avoidance of eye contact, fear of conversations, and complete rejection of industry as a virtue. I don't mean to judge. In many ways, these traits are responsible for making the narrator so relatable. I expect to have more to say about this as I read more of the series.\n\nI do think the book is noticeably flawed. The prose can be a little muddy, and I think there are more than a handful of sentences that I think could have been reworked. One could make the argument that this is the narrator, not the author, but I don't experience the mistakes as deliberate. I also think character development was spared for all but a couple of the key players, making the rest of the crew somewhat indistinguishable and difficult to keep track of.\n\nBut these flaws don't sink the rest of it, and I'm looking forward to reading on.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

This unit, however, has hacked its own governor module and prefers to call itself Murderbot.\n\nMurderbot is an anxious, media-obsessed entity whose primary goal is to perform the bare minimum of its duties so he can get back to binge-watching his favorite serialized dramas. His cynical observations, dry wit, and deeply relatable social awkwardness was unexpected, but made this novella stand out. Murderbot is surprisingly funny and, against all odds, heartwarming.\n\nAll Systems Red is a fast, thrilling read that delivers complex characterization and action-packed suspense in under 150 pages. I highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique, funny, and surprisingly emotional sci-fi escape.\n2025\n \naudiobooks\n3 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Not too ambitious and did everything it was trying to do very well. I really appreciate the length - should not have been any longer or any shorter. Gripping story, interesting and charming characters, and some well-done social commentary, even if it wasn't super ground-breaking or anything. Just a small-scale and delightful story that is written in a compelling and straightforward way and manages to pull off some great world-building. I think my only complaint is she started to lose me with some of the technical detail in the last act, but mostly I found it really cool and I appreciate how all the sci-fi elements are genuinely relevant to the plot and mystery. I am a little skeptical that this kind of quality could be maintained through like 8 more books/novellas, but I will definitely be reading more of them if I can get my hands on them from a library - they seem to be in high demand and I can see why :)\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Wells sure threw an irresistible wind-up pitch on your hopes to read the next book ... This is why I can only give 4 stars. I'd rather have bought a novel than continue reading short excerpts, feeling like an addict following an expensive bread trail.\n\nPerhaps it will be revealed in the following books...Im a bit lost on the need to insert so many multiple partner relationships. It distracts from the main plot and character building and tad, even if the sole purpose is merely an odd hack at speculative science fiction and cultural world-building. For me, it immediately makes almost all the characters unrelatable. Perhaps robotic in a twist of irony.\nLike\nComment"}

Socially awkward reluctant hero and his granola(but surprisingly formidable) scientist found family band together to save the day. Wells is incredibly economical with language, yet the relationships feel complete and alive, especially the quiet, affecting bond between Dr. Mensah and Murderbot. I found the “robot-attains-consciousness” theme more timely than ever; there’s so much conversation about bad singularity, and less about a neutral or humane one. This novella hits that middle ground beautifully.\n\nA few things didn’t land as well: the hybrid organic–mechanical body concept could be clearer(Murderbot can feel pain sort of(?), bleed, regrow like I lizard does it's tail-- I found all this difficult to picture); some background crew members blurred together, and I wish their dialogue had been further reduced to keep focus on the ones with stronger ties to the main character.\n\nStill, every now and then I want a good space thriller and this absolutely scratched the itch.\nLike\nComment"}

While I understand the choice of using a monotone for the main character makes sense due to the writing, it didn’t make for a great listening experience. It also felt like the narrator ran out of voices and started to just make some characters soft spoken instead, which made it difficult to understand at times. Regardless of this less than great narration, I enjoyed the story and will be continuing with the series to learn more about this interesting universe and murder bot.\nLike\nComment"}

The sci-fi elements were enjoyable and believable -another all-too rare quality. And the story itself was engrossing, I was happily surprised by the thrill of it! I could almost complain about the shortness of the book, but that would only be greedy of me as the pace was actually ideal.

I've found out that I'm the opposite: fantasy books are natural to me, but apparently I struggle with sci-fi even if the book is short like this one.\n\nIt's not that the book is complicated or that the world is complex, and it certainly isn't my first sci-fi book (although I don't read that many). It's just that I think I'm not that interested in sci-fi settings and the terminology and concepts are not as natural to me, especially considering that this is a super short book and, therefore, very focused on the action.\n\nThings are happening, people and robots are using systems with names like HubSystem and SecSystem and they're communicating through feeds that they can share or block and then there are guns coming out of a robot's arms and scanners and drones and hoppers and some are small and some are big and then the autopilot is malfunctioning and there's a system breach and suddenly my eyes are glazed over and I'm just reading words.\n\nThe book itself was nice and entertaining and Murderbot is a great main character (although his awkwardness was a bit too much at times) and I somewhat enjoyed the fact that it is such a small book as it kept things focused, but also I somehow took way too long to read this because I wasn't fully immersed or invested.\n\nAll in all, I liked it and I think I'll read the next books as they are all so short, but I think sci-fi is still a bit of a struggle for me.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nDespite enjoying several sci-fi tv shows, I’ve never been particularly drawn to reading the genre. Having said that, The Murderbot Diaries have been on my radar for years, so when I realised All Systems Red fit the prompt for a reading challenge the choice was easy.\n\nAll Systems Red is the first in the series of novellas by Martha Wells (that will number 8 when Platform Decay is released in May 2026) introducing a hybrid organic android who calls itself Murderbot.\n\nOwned by The Company, Murderbot is one of dozens of ‘SecUnits’, deployed to protect people or property, or kill and destroy the same, as management decrees. Murderbot however, is different. After a system malfunction that resulted in the unsanctioned slaughter of fifty seven clients, Murderbot (who adopted the name as a result), hacked their own system, and secretly severed The Company’s control.\n\nAs the story opens, Murderbot, who keeps up the pretence of their programming lest The Company order their destruction, is accompanying a small group of non-profit scientists assessing the value of a planet’s resources. The mission is entirely uneventful until suddenly it’s not, and Murderbot is pulling a scientist from the mouth of a tunnelling carnivorous monster, sparring with a batch of hijacked SecUnits, faking out unscrupulous rival surveyors, and having to spend way too much time with humans when they’d much rather be watching Sanctuary Moon.\n\nBuoyed by perfect pacing, it took me barely an hour to read All Systems Red. The action is fast-paced, the world simply portrayed, and Murderbot is immediately appealing.\n\nCynical and stoic yet awkward and vulnerable, Murderbot has a surprisingly complexity. I enjoyed how the dynamic between Murderbot and the group of humans under his protection further informed his character.\n\nDespite the brevity of the novella format, Wells raises questions about identity, autonomy, and humanity, all with a delightfully deadpan sense of humour.\n\nAn entertaining and easy read I’m eager to devour the rest of the Murderbot Diary series and watch the recently released Murderbot series on AppleTV+.\n2025-challenges\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}
