I must have been cranky or something when I first reviewed this. This is basically the perfect comfort reading, ideal for when you get a book out of the library and it turns out to be painfully depressing and you just need to read something safe and fun and good.\n\n~~original review follows~~\n\nI deeply enjoyed this; Murderbot is basically the perfect point of view character for me, and the plot is entertaining and fast-paced and compelling. What there is of this story could honestly not be more delightful for me.\n\nAnd that's where my complaint comes in. This book is just -- not long enough. It's not got the depth of worldbuilding or intricacy of plot that I generally associate with Martha Wells, and it feels very much like it is setting up something, the prequel to something, the introduction to something amazing. And even though I loved the book, I couldn't help also wanting that amazing thing I saw the potential for.\nShow more\nrobots\n \nsff\n \nspaceships\n \n...more\n40 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Mark\nAuthor \n5 books\n34 followers\nFollow\nApril 13, 2025\nThis was my first foray into modern SF, and what an excellent gateway it was! I really enjoyed how the story focused on the relationship between Murderbot and the rest of the crew, causing the reader to think about what it means to be human.\n\nThe world itself was interesting, and as a newbie SF reader, I didn’t find any of the tech concepts to be over my head. The story, while relatively short (it is a novella, after all) had several exciting moments.\n\nThe best (and most surprising) part was the voice of the narrator; told in first-person POV from the Murderbot’s perspective, I didn’t expect this character to be funny, sarcastic, awkward, and generally self-conscious. But it was all these things, and more. In fact, it’s this character’s personality which really makes the story what it is. I also loved some of the secondary characters, particularly Dr. Mensah.\n\nThis is the first in an ongoing series, and it will be exciting to see what happens next.\nShow more\n40 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Charlotte Kersten\nAuthor \n4 books\n566 followers\nFollow\nDecember 24, 2023\nSo What’s It About?\nIn a corporate-dominated space-faring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. For their own safety, exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.\n\nOn a distant planet, a team of scientists is conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid--a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, Murderbot wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is, but when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.\n\nWhat I Thought\n\nI’ve heard people sing praise to Murderbot for years now, and I’m kind of embarrassed that it took me so long to get on the bandwagon. But I read All Systems Red! Finally! And now I’m bandwaggoned!\n\nThis novella is fast-paced, inventive, and clever all throughout. Murderbot’s head is a fascinating one to be in, both because of how it sees the world and functions through technology and because of its complete awkwardness and mortification around humans. I think this is really well done given the way it has existed with and been treated by humans before. You might expect Murderbot to immediately embrace kind treatment instead of what it usually receives, but it responds with panic instead, which feels like such smart writing and characterization.\n\nDespite its alleged apathy towards humankind, Murderbot is still really fond of its humans and does its very best to take care of them as best it knows how. I also really loved seeing how humans reacted to it. Some trusted it while others didn’t; some saw it as an equal person while others didn’t; some asked disconcerting questions about whether it hates or blames humans.\n\nMy only real complaint is that I think Wells missed an incredible opportunity by choosing not to incorporate the media Murderbot loves more. We’re always hearing about how it goes off to watch its shows, but I wish we had heard more about the actual content of those shows and what Murderbot thinks of them. There’s an incredible moment where someone in the team reveals that Murderbot has been watching human media and another person says something about one of the characters on the soap opera it’s watching being guilty of a salacious act that they were accused of. To this (completely distracted from the confrontation it’s in the middle of) Murderbot heatedly responds “No, she fucking didn’t.” I LOVED this moment. It’s hilarious, of course, but it’s also just such a good moment of characterization - a show of rare, relatable emotion that demonstrates how invested Murderbot is in its media. I could see this getting overdone, of course, but I think even a few more moments like that could have added so much. That being said, this was an incredible amount of fun and I can’t wait to read more!\nShow more\nbingo-23\n \nscifi\n \nshort-story-novella\n \n...more\n40 likes\nLike\nComment"

Granted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\n\nShould I be worried? I spent the last three months endlessly watching entertaining feeds and/or raging at stupid people in the news. I might be turning into a murderbot, or maybe I am simply programmed to think I am human, until my secret corporate masters will push the button to activate me. You’d better watch out, there will be mayhem once I go out of quarantine!\n\nAll System Red is the first novella in a new science-fiction project that is tightly plotted, fast-paced and funny. A first person narration from a serial killer perspective, our host is a construct of organic and electronic elements, a Security bot assigned to a geological survey team on a recently discovered exoplanet.\n\nWe all know, thanks to Isaac Asimov, that robots and artificial intelligence in general are subjected to the Laws of Robotics, the prime directive of which says that they should not harm their human masters. But an artificial intelligence is by definition a software capable of learning, and the one that calls itself Murderbot has taught itself some high level hacker code, enough to disable the governor that enforces the Law of Robotics. In its own defense, the Murderbot is annoyed when put to work for the survey team, preferring instead to watch endless re-runs of popular soap operas in space. Because, you know, anything is better than going back to work!\n\nJoking aside, the novella does a great job at setting up the debate of how we define humanity and how we take responsibility for our own actions.\nI will probably read the next three episodes in the following days, curious to see how free will can deal with deeply entrenched paranoia against armed and dangerous intelligent entities who take a critical view of our society.\n\nShow more\n2020\n37 likes\n7 comments\nLike\nComment"

Gepetto loved him dearly, but Pinocchio was quite naughty and rarely spoke the truth. As soon as he lied... Oh wait, it's a different story. Or is it?.. But of course it is! Or not?... Omg it's so enjoyable to mess with your minds right now! All right, all right, enough.\n\nThis cover is absolutely awesome but also super misleading considering book's plot. Which was not disappointing in no way. I think I found my next favourite ongoing series and I can't wait for the next episode. The plot of this one was super simple. SecUnit, an android with half robotic, half organic body, calling itself cutely a \"murderbot\" (that's its job) has hacked its governing system and now has gone rogue... What happens next is this whole novel which you should definitely try, if you're into fast, funny and short sci-fi. Yes, funny, you read me right. If you won't find it funny we're probably from different planets. Which is ok and means we can start cultural exchange. But first you have to read it... No, seriously, go read it and I will personally apologize to you if you give it less than 3 stars*!\n\n* Only if you're my Goodreads friend.

    "text": "aPriL does feral sometimes\n2,195 reviews\n540 followers\nFollow\nFebruary 5, 2021\n‘All Systems Red’ by Martha Wells is the first of what will be called the Murderbot Diaries. The narrator is a snarky robot who speaks like a witty teenager. Xe (it does not have a sex, so using s/he pronouns are erroneous, so, I will use Xe) is a security bot or SecUnit. Xe works for a commercial company responsible for setting up transportation, habitat construction and security for other private for-profit companies or humanitarian or scientific non-profits who wish to explore other planets occupied by non-sentient life forms or simply planetary objects which have important minerals which can be monetized.\n\nXe calls itself Murderbot because its programming involves killing anything which threatens the people who have contracted with the Company for exploration services. However, the Company and everybody else does not know Murderbot hacked its own governor module after a previous protection assignment went wrong. Xe has been autonomous ever since.\n\nAs the novella opens, Xe is protecting a non-profit group of scientists exploring a planet full of non-sentient life. Xe thinks they seem nice, but humans do not really interest Xe beyond paying attention if they ask it. Mostly Xe watches downloads of soap operas while scanning the area for trouble periodically.\n\nXe’s humans are busy exploring a crater when stuff begins to happen which require Xe's services - very bad, life-threatening stuff, the kind of trouble which looks like someone or something is trying to kill all of the scientists! The scientists are scared and so is Xe! What is going on? It is possible from clues that Murderbot's owners, the Company, could be part of whatever is happening. Something issued a command to Xe, trying to take control. No one knows Xe hacked the governor module, so Xe is on its own. As far as Xe is concerned, no one is going to harm the human scientists! Xe sort of likes them. So do I, gentle reader.\n\nI highly recommend this novella. It is a really fun adventure, well written, and very entertaining. It also is sneakily exploring situations in which people and sentient, but enslaved, robots might find themselves interacting.\n\nXe felt female to me, but maybe you will see Xe differently. Let me know.\nShow more\nfavorites\n \nhumor-hilarious-intentional-or-not\n \nolder-teen\n \n...more\n37 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"

So I was maybe not primed at that time to fully appreciate Murderbot in the way that I, today after rereading this in one hilarious fell swoop, now adore them.\n\n\"It was a low-stress group, they didn't argue much or antagonize each other for fun, and were fairly restful to be around, as long as they didn't try to talk to or interact with me in any way.\"\nShow more\nah-deadly\n \nthis-is-a-reread-fool\n37 likes\n28 comments\nLike\nComment"

That's right, the snarkiness brought to you by John Scalzi and his clones as a substitute for character development doesn't have to stop at witty rejoinders. Now you can get a steady stream of it all book long, in this case courtesy of a Murderbot, which is a Security Robot with a troubled past. It's probably the 'bot character that is causing this brief flurry of irrationally exuberant popularity here at GR. That, and the snarkiness, which is like being dipped into the mind of a sulky teenage girl, but with 100% less Justin Bieber references. Said snarkiness is brought on by the 'bot achieving self-awareness but choosing to watch Netflix and muse snarky thoughts about nearby adults all day instead of going full Skynet. Everybody knows you never go full Skynet. The story is nothing special, but it moves along at a relatively brisk pace, and Wells' color-by-numbers prose is adequate for maximum snarkiness delivery.

    "text": "Apatt\n507 reviews\n930 followers\nFollow\nJuly 23, 2019\nHaving less time for leisure reading nowadays novellas are just the thing to avoid taking too long to read just one book. So I found All Systems Red, a novella that won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, this seemed a just the thing. … But is it? Yeah, it is.\n\nThe novella’s title intrigued me, in a clickbaity kind of way. As it turned out the “Murderbot” part of the title is just about the only thing I do not like about this (e)book. I feel that it is not representative of what the book is about, what the Murderbot does throughout the entire narrative is the exact opposite of murdering people. Having said that there was some extensive murdering in his past, vaguely referred to but not depicted. I suspect subsequent volumes of this Murderbot Diaries series will contain more suitably mudery scenes (probably in flashback).\n\nAll Systems Red is the first volume of an ongoing series called The Murderbot Diaries which spans several novellas, a short story and a full length novel in the works. This first volume introduces the unnamed protagonist and first-person narrator who called himself “The Murderbot” inside his mind. To the humans, he is the “SecUnit”, a cyborg “construct” in charge of security and safety of the humans in the survey team he is assigned to protect. The novella is set on an alien planet where a scientific expedition is surveying the planet’s properties and life forms. When the survey team loses contact with another team they investigate and find that this entire other team has been murdered. It soon becomes apparent that the members of the survey team in the SecUnit’s care are also in mortal danger, and they must be kept alive at all costs.\n\nOn the surface All Systems Red is just a sci-fi thriller, with some elements of a murder mystery, espionage, and conspiracy. Digging a little deeper there is some depth underneath the casual colloquial prose style. Throughout the narrative the SecUnit finds human behavior puzzling and human society awkward and uncomfortable. However, he is very dedicated to his assignment of protecting the people under his charge even to the extent of self-sacrifice if necessary. The SecUnit has a hacked “governor module” which enables him to override or ignore commands that he would normally be compelled to follow. This freedom not enjoyed by other constructs also allows for independent thinking which leads to a sort of humanizing “Pinocchio” effect. The best sci-fi often holds up a mirror to our reality and makes us look at ourselves from a different, even-nonhuman, perspective and this is what All Systems Red does so well. The only thing that holds it back from five-stardom is that I do not find the human characters to be as well developed as the cyborg, they all seem to blend into each other and are a little lacking in individuality. Perhaps the author, Martha Wells, became so engrossed in breathing life into the SecUnit character that she accidentally overlooked the people in the survey team. In any case, this is a small gripe and should not dissuade anyone from reading this great little novella.\n\n\nQuotes:\n”It’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.”\n\n\n“Pin-Lee leaned over me and I said, “This unit is at minimal functionality and it is recommended that you discard it.” It’s an automatic reaction triggered by catastrophic malfunction.”\n\n“The problem I was going to have is that the way murderbots fight is we throw ourselves at the target and try to kill the shit out of it, knowing that 90 percent of our bodies can be regrown or replaced in a cubicle. So, finesse is not required. When we left the habitat,”\nShow more\nsci-fi\n34 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Mel (Epic Reading)\n1,113 reviews\n351 followers\nFollow\nDecember 21, 2018\nMurderbot. An ominous name for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps humans out in the future. Martha Wells has given us the first installation (a short novel) of Murderbot in All Systems Red. This is a spunky, fun and adventurous little book. It has lots of action and diverse personalities; not the least of which is Murderbot.\n\nRobots and Gender\nI'm not sure why, and have been thinking about it for days, but I see Murderbot as a woman. This may be because I am a woman and so identify with the AI directly. It maybe that my bisexual mind just likes boobs; or it may be that I want strong robot AI's to be female because women deserve to be lethal as well. I really don't know. All I know is Murderbot was a woman for me from the first page and they have continued to be a woman in my head. Even though Wells uses they, them pronouns for Murderbot. I'm sure there is an interesting sociological or gender studies paper to be written about what gender readers see Murderbot as. Maybe the beautiful of Murderbot is that you can give them the traits you want to be gender neutral or not.\n\nAction Packed\nAll Systems Red is full of adventurous action. From the opening page where we learn of the mining expedition Murderbot is on to the closing chapter in which a most unusual event occurs; All Systems Red delivers a quick read if nothing else. I really enjoyed the action. Although at times I did feel like the plot was a little complex (or maybe how the companies were structured was the problem) to follow. But it didn't really matter at the end of the day because the only important thing is Murderbot.\n\nOverall - Ready for the Next One!\nI already have the second book 'Artificial Condition' on the go. At less than 200 pages these short novels are fun, fast and helping me reach my (very behind) 2018 reading goal. Because Wells has kept all of the Murderbot stories short it doesn't hurt to try it out and see for yourself if it's your thing. I like them and could certainly see myself revisiting them for a reread break at times because they are quick and easy.\n\nFor this and more of my reviews please visit my blog at: Epic Reading\nShow more\nfavorites\n \nown-ebook\n35 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Thibault Busschots\nAuthor \n6 books\n205 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 28, 2022\nMurderbot is a security android, tasked with keeping an exploratory team safe. The humans think Murderbot is just a mindless robot like the rest of the security androids. They couldn’t be more wrong.\n\n\nPlot-wise, it’s quite straight forward but solid and intensely gripping. It reminds me a bit of the Riddick movie Pitch Black for all the right reasons. With a group of humans being stalked and a not entirely human killer protecting them from harm. Especially with the way some humans look at the one person who can protect them, eyes full of doubt and suspicion. Afraid of the unknown basically. Though the book is much more character-driven rather than action-packed. And the plot is actually elevated by Murderbot wanting to protect its humans, while also trying to hide the fact that it broke free from its corporate limitations.\n\n\nThe biggest attraction of this story is without a shred of a doubt the protagonist. The character of Murderbot is just an absolute homerun and it’s so easy to fall in love with this android. Murderbot might be an android and it’s definitely not entirely human in more ways than one, but it is also very relatable. Murderbot is pretty much an introverted teenager. It appears to be wasting time in its formative years by watching tons of mindless entertainment. But it’s actually trying to figure out who or what it wants to be in life. It does so by secluding itself. So it can experiment with what it’s like to be its own boss, instead of always just blindly following the orders it has been given.\n\n\nThe ending doesn’t give us readers the most obvious satisfying climax to the story. But maybe that’s a good thing. And in its defense, it’s without a doubt a solid ending and it fits perfectly with Murderbot’s character arc.\n\n\nIt’s about an introverted robot with a mind of its own. What’s not to like? Easy recommendation.\nShow more\nscience-fiction\n36 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"

I don't have anything particularly bad to say about it and I don't have any positive emotions as well. I would say the entire work is fairly mediocre although I guess the absence of anything I liked is a negative on its own.\n\nThis has a lot to do with my own expectations going into this novella as what sold me on the series apart from the overwhelming praise was that it was supposed to be about a killer robot who only wished to watch TV at home and not do what it was intended for. As a premise I find it quite interesting and I was looking for something funny and quirky as such a character can find itself in all kinds of comedic situations and I thought it had potential to be really enjoyable and different.\n\nAll that character I was waiting for was completely missing from the entire work and the original selling point of the novel turned out to be represented by the main character uttering \"I want to watch TV\" or some equivalent every 10 pages or so. I feel like I would have had something positive to say if the supporting plot or world was particularly interesting but this wasn't the case as well. It really felt like the author wanted readers to connect to the titular Murderbot first and care about everything else afterwards but since I never passed that checkpoint I felt utterly indifferent to everything else as well.\nShow more\n2021-reads\n \nsci-fi\n36 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"

Things go awry, and Murderbot has to save the day. Preferably without murdering.\n\nI did enjoy the story, and I can see why MB is so beloved. It's a funny, sassy lil thing and it's easy to agree with. Its shyness is endearing and we have no trouble reading between the lines when it comes to its personality.\n\nThe story jumps into the action pretty quickly and it doesn't really let up so this is certainly an easy read.\n\nHowever, because it's a short story there's not a lot of world building, and because there's not a lot of world building it can be a little hard to follow at times with all the names for things and organisations we know nothing about, and the lack of names for the things we do encounter. I admit I got a little lost in the jargon and politics.\n\nI really loved the crew and how they all related to MB. They added a much needed humanity to the story so it will be interesting to see where the next book in the story takes the series.\n\nI enjoyed it for the most part but it didn't really match the hype for me. Still, a fun, quick read with a host of great characters. I'll look into the next one just to see where it goes.\nShow more\nsci-fi\n40 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"

I loved it! This is the first of a few short 'novellas', with about 5-8 chapters each- but it certainly reads and feels like a full novel. I mean this is in the highest praise! The characters are so darn well developed and even in a short period, Martha Wells is able to weave a world building that fully immersed me in the planet and the story!\n\nAnd to the main act: Muderbot... he's AWESOME! Clearly the most defining aspect of the narrative surrounds the main character, our 'humanoid' robot, who is incredibly shy, prefers to have no human interaction, watch countless hours of 'vid-entertainment shows and oh...almost forgot, he's a Murderer!\n\n\n\n\n\nMurderbot is a highly technically advanced robot, with 'organic' human parts that makes him nearly indistinguishable to a real human! These 'bots' are purposed to help scientist in their planetary mission. When shit hits the fan, and a group of scientists realize their lives are in peril, Murderbot has no option but to help them...the end result is pretty kick ass!\n\nMartha Wells has a wild imagination, and her sense of 'comedic' timing is spot on! Murderbot wants nothing else but being left alone, away from humans. It is this exact friction between Murderbot's unwillingness to interact with humans that makes this story such a gem. The slow transformation of 'bot' despite his internal directives, and his human connection increase the appeal of the story ten fold!\n\n“They were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. I can't do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans.”\n― Martha Wells, All Systems Red\n\n4 1/2 Stars\nShow more\nsci-fi\n \nseries\n35 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"

They must take SecUnits—part human, part robot security androids—with them, as supplied by the Company.\nSecUnit Murderbot is accompanying their team of humans not as an android with orders, but as a secretly independent construct (having hacked their way to freedom). When their team’s mission takes a grim turn, however, Murderbot is forced to give up their introverted tendencies in order to save their humans from death.\n\n~★~\n\nThe Murderbot Diaries is the first series I’ve read that consists mainly of novellas, so I didn’t have solid expectations going in. That being said, it quickly became evident that there weren’t enough pages to develop a strong world. Martha Wells’ talents definitely lie elsewhere: in crafting her protagonist.\n\n\n“And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.”\n\n\nMurderbot is brilliantly written character that I guarantee everyone can relate to in some way. Their overall train of thought and persistent insecurities felt so true and full of heart, I loved them from the beginning. Although I wasn’t invested in the plot, I’d say All Systems Red was worth it solely for the protagonist. I’m considering continuing with the series just to see more of Murderbot!\nShow more\n3-stars\n \nnovellas-and-anthologies\n35 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Dirk Grobbelaar\n854 reviews\n1,228 followers\nFollow\nMarch 7, 2022\nWell this is a really pointless review. If you like Science Fiction you have heard of this already, and you have either read it or you are going to read it. It's been popping up in all my recommendations for a while now, and with cover art as awesome as that, it really was only a matter of time.\n\nNow, full disclosure: the one reason I was initially skittish about reading this, is because it is a novella. That shouldn't matter, and it likely doesn't (to just about everybody else), but for some reason I have always preferred novel length stories.\n\nAnyway, that's neither here nor there. This book made a significant impact. It was nominated for just about every Science Fiction award you can quickly think of and it won the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards (for best novella).\n\nAnd yes, it is totally worth it. This story of a security bot who has hacked its own governing module (thereby giving itself access to free choice) is fun and moves really quickly. There are some cool reveals about \"Murderbot\" and its past, as well as an intriguing final act that will have you wanting to read the sequels.\n\nI have subtracted a star because the story is sparse on detail and limited in scope (some reviewers have been likening it to a YA novel, but it is also perhaps in order to keep it to novella length). It reads quick as hell though, so even if it isn't your cup of tea it won't be time wasted. That said, it's hard for me to imagine anybody not enjoying this.\n\nI'm glad to see there are sequels - although I do hope that at least some of them are full novels.\nShow more\nacquired-in-2022\n \nbooks-i-own\n \nhugo-award-winners\n \n...more\n35 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"

Too cheesy for my taste.\n\nIf in a fantasy work I welcome cheesy stuff (if it’s not too much), in a sci-fi one I expect the “what if” to surprise me with ideas and worldbuilding. I just don’t care about an emotional bot who/which watches soap opera...\n\nI guess I already have three ‘robots’ on a pedestal and it’s hard for another to rise up to them: Reynolds’ Hesperus, Asimov’s R. Daneel Olivaw and Herbert’s Erasmus.\n\nSo, if you like a mystery case on a faraway planet, then this is for you. If you look for a more scientific approach, look somewhere else.\nShow more\nsci-fi\n33 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Johannes\n4 reviews\n2 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 16, 2017\nI did not care for this book.\nBased on the book description it should have been right up my ally, but I was really disappointed.\n\nThe book seems to get great reviews by other readers, however I don't think this is a true reflection of this book. I think that most readers either a) never finished the book, or b) simply did not want to waste another minute writing a review of the book.\n\nSo my fellow readers, if you are considering this book please read this review as I think it will give you a more balanced view of the book.\n\nMy biggest problem is the characters - And there are quite a few of them. The sad thing is, that I cant even tell you how many characters there are. I estimate that there are 6 - 10 characters in the book, but they are all so bland and frankly non-essential to the plot, that I could not tell them apart. You get little to no information about them other than a name and a team function. There are also some interpersonal relations between them, but again they do not matter for the plot at all.\n\nThe plot itself is thin, and only works if you care about the characters, and since I didn't, the plot did not work for me at all.\n\nThe world building is basically non-existent. Lots of references to other places and cultures, but no info on them. Its basically just all footnotes.\n\nI am not usually this harsh in my reviews, and always try to give the book the benefit of the doubt, but in this case I simply don't think this book is worth your time.\n\nIf you are looking for a book in this style with a robot / cyborg as the protagonist, I would suggest you consider these books instead:\n\n- The Alchemy of Stone by Ekaterina Sedia\n- Cinder by Marissa Meyer (Love warning)\n\nOr if you are just looking for an awesome catheter driven sci-fi book please consider The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. One of my all-time favourite books.\n\nI hope this review was useful to you.\nShow more\n31 likes\n5 comments\nLike\nComment"

I’m not especially fond of novellas. This one, though…\n\nI can’t even really explain what appealed to me about this novella: Murderbot neither really feels like a robot nor like a person but still strangely… plausible.\nMurderbot’s actions feel logical, yet simple. It does what it has to do. Its ambiguity as an artificial lifeform makes it feel both familiar in, e. g. its shyness and some other emotions - not to speak of its entertainment addiction.\nPlus: An artificial lifeform that (sometimes) acts more humanely than its human counterparts? Fascinating!\n\nMurderbot is literally strange enough to go through a contrasting melange of emotions as well. This contrast, the SecUnit's conflicting feelings and survival strategies are probably what made this story so wondrously attractive for me.\n\nAll in all, the novella is based on an interesting premise with a good mixture of characters and a lot of suspense. Spice that up with Murderbot itself and its diverse clients and you get a modern, fresh approach to science fiction.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\nShow more\n0_wk_read_2020\n \nfavorites\n34 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"

And that's a good reason to be in a book discussion group right there--you learn about books and authors you might not have found on your own. I enjoyed the book, or I should say novella. It's very short, under 150 pages, and serves as an introduction to \"Murderbot.\" There is a series of novellas that follow. The hero is a \"bot,\" a SecUnit provided by the Company to protect an exploratory team sent to another planet. In this case, the bot has become self-aware and calls itself (?) \"Murderbot\" and the story is from its diary and told from its point of view. The main interest for me is following the bot's growth of its self-awareness and its developing relationship to the team. There's also a mystery. Another mission on the same planet goes dark and Murderbot and its team have to get to the truth--before they disappear. I look forward to reading more of the Murderbot Diaries and may look for other books by the author Martha Wells.\nShow more\n34 likes\nLike\nComment"

I just watched the fourth episode of the apple TV adaptation and kept complaining loudly how untrue to the book it is. Nope, I have bad recall! So, again the Graphic Audio… They did a good job with that fourth episode. And for me this was a nice little bit of comfort reading.\n\n+*+*+\nReview from October 2024:\n\nI decided to try a Graphic Audio adaptation.\n“Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!“\nIt‘s about 30 minutes shorter than the unabridged audio, which I also haven‘t listened to yet.\n\nThe dramatized audio was ok. Not sure how Murderbot sounded in my head before, but different. Snarkier? And Dr. Mensa sounds too young?\n\nNow I want to know what ART sounds like. Onwards to the next one!\n\n+*+*+\nReview from October 2023:\n\nRe-read 6 years after my first time. I just read System Collapse (Murderbot #7), had a lot of fun and decided that it is finally time for a re-read of the entire series.\n\nWow, I didn‘t remember that the plot was so dramatic! I had forgotten most of it. And I had also forgotten that so many of the characters showing up in later novellas were here already. I also didn‘t recall the quieter scenes. Maybe it needs a re-read to pick up those details.\n\nNot trying to assign a gender to Murderbot anymore. I am probably also sadder about its horrible circumstances and the choices it has to make to protect its humans.\n\nMoving along to Artificial Condition. This is great comfort reading.\n\n+*+*+\nReview from October 2017:\n\nThis was fun, especially the inner monologue of our Murderbot.\n\nIn just 160 pages the author managed to build a believable world with lively and varied characters and an entertaining plot. This is a winner!\n\n\"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\"\nThat could be me on any given day.\n\nLots of potential. Is Murderbot a real person or not? The awkwardness of the crew, trying to figure out the correct way of interacting with Murderbot, once they realized that perhaps there is a person behind that opaque faceplate, was pretty priceless.\n\nAnd Murderbot's horror at their attempts to interact! Talking to the humans! And feelings, oh no!\n\nI tried not to assign a gender to Murderbot. I don't want to use \"it\" as a personal pronoun. I am leaning towards using \"him\", not quite sure why. Well, actually, because I pictured him as the android in the Prometheus movies, aka Michael Fassbender.\n\nThis will be a long wait, the sequel is only planned for May 2018!\nShow more\nread-2024\n \nread-2025\n33 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"

Although Wells goes to some trouble to tell us that Murderbot has no gender or sexual desire, I couldn't help feeling that it was female. I bet male readers feel that it is a man. Murderbot is so human in its desire to do only as much work as it has to and in its desire to lose itself in media to avoid an uncomfortable reality.\n\nJust like anyone, this SecUnit likes people who like it. It is used to being treated like property, so when Dr. Mensah and her team start to treat it decently and like an actual sentient being, they become a priority for this rogue SecUnit. Because Murderbot has managed to hack its own governor and it no longer has to obey human commands.\n\nMurderbot is many things. A pessimist, for one. If it knew about Murphy's Law, it would undoubtedly recognize it. But it's also pretty good at thinking outside the SecUnit box, which it credits to all of its media consumption.\n\nI found the ending surprising, but this obviously there is more to the story that will be revealed in the next installment.

It’s told in first person from the perspective of a genderless android known as SecUnit since it works in security. It likes the human crew it’s assigned to protect but feels awkward and shy about interacting with the humans socially.\n\nThe science expedition is busy with expedition duties when a neighboring expedition disappears from communications. That’s the whole story. So the heart of the story is the SecUnit (which calls itself Murderbot) dealing with human interaction in crisis and non-crisis settings.\n\nWith all the talk of android feelings, I kept thinking of “Red Dwarf”:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBsDv...\n\nAndroids have feelings, too.\nShow more\n2018-books\n \nkindle\n \nscience-fiction\n33 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"

He actually has, if not a warm glowing heart, a sense of obligation to do right by the humans he’s been tasked to protect.\n\nFull of wry wit, smart scifi bits, and plenty of action, there’s also of course the never ending debate, that is lightly touched upon here and will most likely delve deeper in subsequent books, of what makes something or someone human?

And this is the strength of this novella - the voice of its main character - a security bot, part biological, part synthetic, 'rented' to a group of scientists manning experiments on a new planet.\n\n\"Murderbot\", as It calls itself in private, sounds completely 'human' through its thoughts, sarcasm, predilection for watching serials, and boredom from its job, in charge of security for forever changing groups of people that only see it as a fixture. Even its anti-social tendencies ring true, more symptoms of someone not used to interact than dislike, as proved by its loyalty and determination in saving its humans. The current team happens to be more respectful than precedent ones, and due to weird happenings that put them all in serious danger, fertile ground for development.\n\nLoved it :0)\nShow more\nfavourites\n \nread2017\n \nread2022\n \n...more\n32 likes\nLike\nComment"

The book starts off with a bang as a survey team finds themselves in mortal peril on a routine assignment. Then they start to notice anomalies in the map, a team on the other side of the planet is not responding, etc. Something is not right. Is Murderbot with its regular updates a danger to the team? Is the company who is financing and supporting the teams also sabotaging them? We get to know the survey team, its activities, and environment through the eyes of our droid. Even in this relatively short novella, the reader becomes attached. Is Murderbot really an augmented human? I may never find out as I am not invested enough to go onto the second book, but am glad to have spent time on this one to see why so many of my Goodreads friends have been reading this series.

    "text": "Tim\n491 reviews\n837 followers\nFollow\nJune 6, 2018\nNote: There will be quotes in this review. Many of them. Murderbot is so delightfully quotable, that I think it speaks for itself better than I ever could.\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nIt’s borderline uncomfortable how much I relate to Murderbot. I really feel like I should not have anything in common with, well… a Murderbot, but I relate far more to this machine than pretty much any other protagonist I’ve read in some time. Murderbot is sarcastic, snide, a bit more kindhearted than one would expect given the name, but most of all, really just wants to be left alone with its hobbies.\n\n“It was a low-stress group, they didn’t argue much or antagonize each other for fun, and were fairly restful to be around, as long as they didn’t try to talk or interact with me in any way.”\n\nMurderbot is a security-based robot who is in charge of watching a group of scientists who have, for some reason, become a target for some unknown organization. They are on an isolated planet, their systems have been hacked, their maps are missing key points, hostile creatures want to eat them, other security robots are being reprogramed to attack them and worst of all they want to talk to Murderbot about its feelings.\n\n“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\"\n\nAs you may have noticed from the quotes, Murderbot is rather sarcastic, snide and humorously antisocial. It really would rather watch sci-fi soap operas and do its job (in its own words, in a rather “half assed fashion”), but people want to understand it, and yes, it does feel enough responsibility to want to keep its clients alive… well, most of them.\n\nThe book is rather hilarious. I hate to compare it to Douglas Adams, as Adams was more consistently absurd, but the humor throughout this book worked for me so well that I can honestly say I haven’t laughed this hard at a science fiction book since I originally ready The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and that is extremely high praise indeed.\n\nThis was almost a 5 star read for me. Its length is very short (around 150 pages) and had it been longer with expansion upon the plot and a more satisfactory ending, it probably would have made that last star. It also suffers a bit from having fairly forgettable meatbag… excuse me, I mean human characters. As things stand though, it is still a solid 4 star read and I’m looking forward to continuing the series at some point. It won me over with its loveable misanthropic protagonist, a great sense of humor and some genuinely interesting ideas.\n\n“I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.”\n\nWell said Murderbot! Well said!\nShow more\n2010s\n \nhumor\n \nreviewed\n \n...more\n29 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Serge\n133 reviews\n42 followers\nFollow\nMay 1, 2022\nActual Rating: 2.75/5\n\n\n\n\nMurderbot, a cyborg that was able to hack into its governor module and gain independence, by not having to follow company commands, hates dealing with humans. It just wants to do its job and spend hours watching soap-operas. Unfortunately for Murderbot, the mission it's on gets exceptionally hectic, and it has to sacrifice its precious alone time to deal with the messy problems of messy humans. Throughout this debacle, Murderbot notices that these humans actually care for its well-being, and don't see it as a purely disposable machine that can be easily replaced. Even more shocking is the fact that Murderbot might just be slowly reciprocating these feelings back.\n\nThis is a short SF novella that is very much loved by the SF community, so I went into it with high expectations. However, it seems like I've found myself treading the dangerous \"Unpopular Opinionland\" with this one. This novella didn't elicit any feelings in me. Murderbot didn't really feel like a cyborg, and felt like just another grumpy old human who slowly softens up. I had trouble suspending my disbelief and convincing myself that a machine is capable of being this human like. The plot was utterly forgettable for me, and as I write this review after about 10 days of finishing the novella, I am truly struggling to remember what even happened. Perhaps I should have listened to the audiobook? Maybe hearing the narration might have immersed me more into this story... But as it stands, I can't really seem to see anything special here.\n\nI still want to give this series more of a try though, so I will be reading the next installment, or perhaps listening to it, hoping Murderbot will grow on me eventually.\n\n\n\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed.

I enjoyed the character of Murderbot the more the book when on but I'm wondering if it was really necessary to mention that it likes watching serials so much?

Free\n4.5 Stars for Murderbot\n4 Stars for Plot\n\nOne of the beautiful aspects about words is that you can say a lot with very little or a lot. You can make a simple sentence to have the effect of a loaded gun. You can describe with a thousand words and strip away all mystery from the unknown.\n\nI started my re-read of the Murderbot Diaries because I'm rather excited about the new release coming out in a few days. Back in 2018, I had to try several times to get into this story. It took a while to snag my interest but it didn't take long for me to become a fan of Murderbot, the cranky introvert.\n\nI have a couple of personal themes that are repeating in my reading in 2020:\n\n- Rediscovering the joy of stories told in different styles of simple to complex weaving of characters, setting and plot. It's not enough for me to jump around in genres to keep my brain actively involved in books. I also need different writing styles, voices & themes to keep engaged.\n\n- Finding comfort in re-reading books that I have loved or eyed with mild disgruntlement due to the work involved in reading it. I don't need to love a character or the core plot in order to enjoy a story or writing. I do need to be engaged in some manner to read the story from start to finish but it doesn't always have to be instant love. Sometimes, I will love the \"how/why\" behind the writing more than the story written.\n\n- True to Character: For the past year, I've come to have more fun with re-reads due to how well the author has created a world & character and they stay true to the core aspects from start to finish. Sometimes, it's harder to see or appreciate the humor or nuances that are given from the start because I'm not familiar with the world/character. Going back in gives me the chance to see all the details put into place with more awareness. I love seeing how events/etc are established in a small detail or pivotal event and how it impacts the whole series.\n\nAll Systems Red\nThe first couple of times I listened to the story, I thought the story was cool but a little light in areas that could have made it more. That's still true. In this round, I love how there's no wasted words. Each one was there for a reason/s and the whole story is very active. There is a steady progression of thoughts, ideas and actions taken from start to finish. It's much more obvious on the re-read.\n\n10/03/2018 Notes:\n\nI didn't really have any expectations when I started this book. I knew that a lot of my friends like the series and the latest addition was published yesterday. The beginning was a little murky and I wasn't sure what was going on, but details for the setting and characters became clearer as I listened. Murderbot definitely has a personality and it's fun to watch it's evolution.\nShow more\naudiobook\n \nfavorites\n \nreviewed\n29 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Sebastien Castell\nAuthor \n58 books\n4,968 followers\nFollow\nDecember 1, 2018\nWhat a great read! I wasn't sure what to make of Martha Wells's All Systems Red at first, but Murderbot drew me in quickly. A construct made from cloned human material and robotic parts, Murderbot was created to provide security for various human clients. But Murderbot has a secret: it has managed to hack its governor unit (the component that forces it to obey commands), and while still pretending to be submissive to its human clients, has taken up watching countless hours of TV shows in its spare time. In the process, Murderbot has developed its own ideas about the nature of humanity and free will. When the humans it's been rented out to simultaneously come to terrible danger and start treating it as a person, Murderbot becomes both protective and horribly uncomfortable.\n\n(I should note: for some reason I kept reading Murderbot as 'she', but I don't think there's any evidence of that in the book itself, so I'm clearly introducing some of my own reader bias here. Martha Wells has commented on this subject and made it clear that Murderbot does not see itself as having a gender.)\n\nOverall, the story is engaging and well told, and always at the centre is this entity that largely can't stand to be around humans and yet is gradually becoming more and more what we would call human, while Murderbot itself would rather pretty much any other word. That alone is worth the couple of hours to read the book. If there was any disappointment for me with All Systems Red it was only that the climax itself felt a bit rushed and ended a bit flat for me. The epilogue quickly brings back what makes Murderbot so fascinating, however, and I'm keen to read the next instalment.\n\nI've never read novellas before, but lately I'm starting to really enjoy the form, and All Systems Red is a great one to start with if you're thinking of jumping in.\nShow more\nscience-fiction\n30 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"

I had a good feeling about this book when I found myself chuckling on the very first page. This was a story that I didn't want to start once I got started which worked out perfectly since it is short enough to be read in a couple of hours. I am glad that I finally decided to spend a little bit of time getting to know Murderbot.\n\nMuderbot is a SecUnit that is technically rogue since it decided to hack its own governor module. Obviously, Murderbot isn't letting anyone know that its governor module has been compromised because if the Company knew they would just get things working the way that they want once again. Murderbot has developed a fondness for human media since going rogue and loves to spend long hours viewing downloaded media.\n\nThe story was pretty exciting with some unexpected surprises along the way and plenty of action. I loved Murderbot's view of the world and the humor woven into the story. This is definitely a novella that science fiction fans will not want to miss.\n\nI won a digital copy of this book from Books of My Heart. Thanks, Anne!\n\nInitial Thoughts\nThis was great!

I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.\n\n\nI loved reading this, and it was exactly the escape that I needed: funny, interesting, and easy to read in a few sittings (probably just one sitting if you aren't perpetually tired). The main character is a half-human, half-construct that calls itself Murderbot and exists solely to act as a security detail on interplanetary missions, shooting anything that threatens the crew. This is surprisingly relatable—who wants to interact with anyone when they could be watching endless seasons of a soap opera and slacking off at work?—and extremely funny. There's quite a lot of action, and though it does feel like the plot is somewhat secondary to the Murderbot concept, the book gallops along so fast that it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe best thing about this book is that there are SIX MORE to read!!

The main characters is a rather likable cyborg who was programmed to be a killer and defender, contracted from his corporate owner to defend whomever he is hired to defend. And to follow orders.\n\nAll Systems Red is primarily an action adventure story that gains dry comedy through the matter-of-fact attitude of the Murderbot. And there is a hint of emotional tension that arises from the fact that our \"hero\" has removed his control chip, just before his current mission. He no longer has to follow orders, so the question is what will he do with his new-found freedom.\n\nAdmittedly this story is short. A nugget more than a novel. Will be interesting to see if the author can do something worthwhile with her character in the next book in the series or if it turns out to have been just a gimmick.

I can't give it 5 stars because it didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading more from this series.\n\nOne big knock on this book is the heft price-tag.

Dejo la reseña de hace 6 años:\n\nNota para quien vaya a escuchar el audiolibro en inglés: No lo hagáis.\nHa sido una pena escucharlo porque el narrador debía de tener un mal día y parecía que estaba quedándose dormido. De hecho creo haber escuchado un bostezo de fondo.\nMe ha sacado de la lectura y no he podido apreciar del todo el tono de Murderbot, y el tono es el 90% del libro.\nMurderbot engancha desde la primera frase y aunque la historia sea ligera y muy corta, se lee gracias a la empatía que genera el robot.\nEl día que lo lea en español o en inglés seguro que subo la nota.\nShow more\nscience-fiction\n30 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"

Not many of those books are good.\n\nThis one rocks!\n\nIf you know about an assassin droid HK-47 from the Star Wars universe and you liked him and his twisted sense of sarcasm - you will love every second (err.. page?) of this book. If not, it doesn't really matter.\n\nNot so much cynical sarcasm here as much as a healthy dose of android humor. I leave it up to you to decide how much exactly is a healthy dose. I had a blast.\n\nSo, the story:\n\nPeople go to planetary exploration missions or just colonize those planets. People like doing that.\n\nIndigenous life on those planets, however, generally doesn't. Indigenous life can be dangerous to the abovementioned human brave hearts.\n\nTo minimize the loss of life, The Company supplies explorers with security droids in addition to ships, supplies and general logistics.\n\nOn the other hand, to minimize the loss of money, explorers (mostly their employers) often sign up for the services of the lowest bidder in the security business.\n\nIf you haven't guessed it already, this is where our friendly droid comes in. All security units come with a Governor module installed which, among other things, prevents the android from going berserk and horribly murdering the exploration party he's tasked with protecting.\n\nOf course, being made of cheap parts, his Governor module is also made of crap and allows the android to hack and override it. He doesn't horribly murder his exploration party (at least not yet :) but he does call himself MurderBot because of an event from his past. That knowledge would raise quite a few eyebrows if those pesky humans with their million questions only knew about it.\n\nThis is a good, action-packed story about a self-aware, socially-awkward android who just wants to be left alone. But that's not going to happen.\n\nOh, and body parts will fly left and right - both human and android alike.\n\nI'm fairly certain I did not actually buy this book but it was given to me for review. Whoever you are, thank you for this gem! I'm putting the sequel high on my to-do list.\n\nThe story is gripping and narration just perfect. I shed a tear or two after realizing the book is barely over 3 hours long. I need a sequel!\n\nNot 10 days after reading the book, I saw the tram in Amsterdam heading for Murderbot Station. I had to take a picture xD\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAll Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries #1)\nby Martha Wells (Goodreads Author), Kevin R.

    "text": "Jennifer\n552 reviews\n313 followers\nFollow\nApril 19, 2022\nWell, here's the most charming unreliable narrator I've come across in ages: a security bot that has secretly hacked its way to autonomy and refers to itself by the name of Murderbot. Contrary to expectation, Murderbot prefers to keep to itself and binge-watch serials in between half-assing its job as security detail for scientists surveying a new planet.\n\nThings go dramatically wrong with giant toothy tunneling things, and then wrong in more troubling ways - autopilot failures, map inaccuracies, sudden silence from a sister survey team. Having hacked its governor module, Murderbot doesn't have to do anything, but it might just be able to save the day. If it wants. If it likes its humans enough. But whoa, feelings? Not Murderbot's cuppa.\n\nSo, I'm awkward with actual humans. It's not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it's not them; it's me. I know I'm a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous. Also, if I'm not in the armor then it's because I'm wounded and one of my organic parts may fall off and plop on the floor at any moment and no one wants to see that.\n\nAll Systems Red is an unusual coming-of-age (er, sentience?) story whose charm lies mostly in its quirky bot main character. Murderbot is indifferent to its job, feels utter contempt for the company that owns it (\"we're cheaply produced and we suck. Nobody would hire us for non-murdering purposes unless they had to\"), and fascinated with human entertainment media. Considering that there's a fair bit of violence in the story, Murderbot's detached perspective makes it a lighter read than it otherwise might be.\n\nI snorted out loud in amusement and solidarity more often than I probably should have:\n\nI'd watched three episodes of Sanctuary Moon and was fast forwarding through a sex scene when Dr. Mensah sent me some images through the feed. (I don't have any gender or sex-related parts (if a construct has those you're a sexbot in a brothel, not a murderbot) so maybe that's why I find sex scenes boring. Though I think that even if I did have sex-related parts I would find them boring.\n\n\nIt's a short novella at 149 pages, so the world-building and characters are lightly drawn but promising. I was disappointed that this planet's fauna are so overwhelmingly earthy (really, a different planet also evolved birds, insects, and reptiles?), but I liked the polyamory and non-traditional relationships between the humans and the complex tangle of politics and history beyond this planet.\n\nI'm up for spending more time in this world and have already requested the sequel. More Murderbot, please!\nShow more\n29 likes\n11 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Maxwell\n1,441 reviews\n12.4k followers\nFollow\nAugust 6, 2021\nMurderbot is a sentient AI robot of sorts that accompanies expeditions as their SecUnit (security unit). Murderbot doesn't particularly like people; in fact, they'd rather spend their time watching soap operas. They have also overridden their system to be able to make their own decisions, and we know they have a haunted past where something bad happened. On this particular mission, something goes awry, and this short novella examines that mystery, shows us who Murderbot is, and wraps it all up in a pretty neat package.\n\nFor me, there wasn't anything particularly special about this. It's quite short (the audiobook is just over 3 hours) and from my understanding this series doesn't have a full-length novel until book 5—so I presume the first 4 novellas are more like auxiliary material to introduce you to the characters and world. I sort of knew that going in but still wasn't prepared for how simple and, honestly, boring this book was. Murderbot has some quirky qualities and his internal monologue had that sassy robot point-of-view, but it never made me laugh out loud.\n\nI think this is one of those things I chalk up to personal preference. I don't have anything bad to say about this, it just wasn't for me. I'm debating whether I should bother continuing with the series because if this one is just setting up the world, it feels harsh to give up after just book 1. But also if they don't really change much, then I doubt I'm going to love them. Would appreciate hearing feedback in the comments!\nShow more\naudiobook\n \nshort-novels\n29 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"

I wasn't sure what I'd think of a sort of human robot, but the hype did not disappoint.\n\nCONTENT WARNING: (not actual spoilers, just a list of topics) \ngore and violence. Some discussion of slavery.\n\nThings to love:\n\n-Anti-social robot! Really I think this is about 85% of the reason to read the story. It doesn't care about you, it just wants to clock out and go home, it would rather talk to a wall than you.\n\n-Its humans! Aw, they were so cute and well-meaning, trying to make it be a person. It was a good way to gently talk about how you can be kind and also do things that hurt people.\n\n-Thrilling story. It's a short, classic story idea but told with such liveliness that it felt fun and fresh.\n\nThings I did not love:\n\n-The narrator. I got this on Audible and the narrator was all wrong. There were soooo many jokes that he made sound boring and clumsy. Instead, I imagined how one friend of mine in particular would read it, for she is basically an all-human, gun-less Murderbot and it was instantly at least 80x more entertaining. I will read the next one with my eyes, or ask her if she'll read it to me.\n\n-It is still pretty light. It's just fun. It's short, to the point, nothing super dramatic. It entertains. That is its function and it does so admirably.\n\nLots of fun, great first installment.

Se me ha quedado bastante corto. Matabot como personaje me ha hecho mucha gracia. Tiene golpes muy buenos y demasiado “humanos”.\n\nMe ha faltado worldbuilding como desarrollo de los personajes. Sin embargo, hay que tener en cuenta que la historia está contada desde el punto de Matabot y todo lo que le rodea.\n\n“Es un error pensar que un hibrido es mitad Bot y mitad humano. Así parece que las dos partes son distintas, que la parte Bot querrá obedecer ordenes y hacer su trabajo, mientras que la parte humana querrá protegerse a sí misma y salir cagando leches de allí. Y eso es todo lo contrario a la realidad: era una entidad completa y confundida, sin la más remota idea de lo que quería hacer. O lo que debería hacer. O lo que tenía que hacer”.\n\nEl final me ha dejado un poco descolocada. Igualmente voy a seguir leyendo estos libros entre otras novelas más densas. Me gustaría saber que es lo que le depara a esta SegUnidad enganchada a las telenovelas.\n\n“Detesto tener emociones por cosas reales.

Still a quick, fun read that, thus far, is getting a good adaptation on streaming.\n\n~\n\nThis was an excellent sci-fi novella told from a very unique point of view: a socially anxious, introverted murderbot (its term, not mine).\n\nOne way sci-fi stories, especially length constrained novellas, can fail is putting in too much exposition in building the world and not enough attention spent on getting a good story on the page. Wells avoids this by only relating what is important about the world as needed and not worrying about such things as: how did Humanity spread to the stars? Why are corporations so powerful? Why are ancient aliens artifacts and ruins so prized? Is the Simpsons still running?\n\nBy concentrating just on the ideas that are immediately important to the narrative Wells is able to tell a tight, exciting story that offers some glimpses into this future world without bogging down the thrust of the plot. Plus, leaving so many blank spaces in this universe offers her opportunities to explore them in later books.\n\nAs far as the story went it was tight, fast paced, action packed but held space for character introspection and development. Wells expertly balanced world building, character development, and story exceedingly well. I look forward to the future installments of this series.\nShow more\nnovella\n \nreviewed\n \nscience-fiction\n30 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship\n1,419 reviews\n2,010 followers\nFollow\nApril 5, 2022\nI shouldn’t have liked this book. It’s very science fiction, with comms and feeds and HubSystems and MedSystems in nearly every paragraph, and as far as I can tell it also has planet-spanning cultures that are basically Modern American with one or two tweaks, and a generic aspect to the setting, seen for example in people’s consuming “food pacs” rather than any actual cuisine. Not only that, it’s definitely a space mystery/thriller; I find comparison to Firefly apt, and I stopped watching Firefly after the third episode (the horror one). This book, too, has a bit where we run around a station in which everyone has been brutally massacred and the killers are hiding—though happily, it doesn’t lean into the horror elements.\n\nAnd yet, I did thoroughly enjoy the novella, reading the whole book in one sitting. It has a sci-fi setting and a thriller plot, but it’s really a story about characters and relationships. Readers love Murderbot, which makes sense since it (awkward pronouns for a character but the ones used in the actual book! I read it as mostly male but have been interested to see others’ differing interpretations) is quite endearing: socially awkward and mostly interested in retreating to private spaces to consume media, but programmed for heroism and increasingly invested in protecting its group of humans. That so many people are drawn so strongly to a character who hates human interaction, half-asses their job and just wants to watch trash TV perhaps speaks to cultural malaise, but here we are. And Murderbot has a great voice.\n\nThe scientists, meanwhile, are quite well-drawn given Bot’s disinterest in their appearances, lives or emotions—the reader winds up with a solid sense of who these people are, and I found their dynamics as a group of friends engaging and believable. Insecure authors who feel the need to telegraph everything about everyone through their point-of-view character to the point that it borders on preternatural (“I saw fear on his face, followed by determination, with a hint of smugness quickly concealed….”) should read this book as a great example of how much about a character can be conveyed through their words and actions alone. I wound up liking the group of scientists quite a bit, especially the growing friendship between Bot and Dr. Mensah, which is lovely.\n\nI do have a couple of criticisms that don’t simply boil down to disliking sci-fi. A couple of plot and setting elements are rather unconvincing. \nFirst, I have doubts about the viability of murderbots: of course it’s handy that they can easily regenerate from what for a human would be a catastrophic injury, while being programmed for selfless obedience. However, not only are they extremely expensive to create, but they apparently go rogue often enough that a group that wants to prevent questions being asked thinks that staging this as their cover story for murder is a good idea. And rogue bots can slaughter dozens of people singlehandedly. Seems like a team of human security guards, perhaps supplemented by fully artificial robots, would be both safer and cheaper. Second, if what the evil survey group wants is exclusive rights to mine the planet without anyone else’s realizing it’s an archaeological site, secretly murdering the other survey groups seems extreme: have they considered just buying exclusive rights immediately and then evicting the others before they discover the truth? Why wouldn’t the political entities that bought the rights for the original surveys not send new survey groups if the first ones were killed by malfunctioning security bots that have nothing to do with the actual planet? And then, the ending perhaps wraps up more than such a short book calls for: \nBot’s being owned by the corporation could have been milked for a lot more drama, which makes me wonder if Wells wrote this one without any guarantee there would be sequels, or if she just didn’t like that angle.\n\nAt any rate, I definitely did enjoy this, unusually for a novella; and the novella format probably helped, reducing the impact of elements I don’t ordinarily like. I plan to continue to the sequel, though I’d also love it if subsequent books were a bit less mystery/thriller than this.\nShow more\n4-stars\n \nfavorites\n \nscience-fiction\n \n...more\n27 likes\n16 comments\nLike\nComment"

Murderbot\n3). Murderbot\n\nDid I mention Murderbot???\n\nOkay, so I expected to enjoy this tremendously, but I NEVER expected to love it THIS much. I have become so deeply attached to Murderbot and developed so much care about what happens to it that I am ecstatic to continue the diaries. I actually knew this would be a 5-star read for me just from the first few pages. When I find myself randomly thinking about a book I am reading throughout the day, 99.9% of the time it turns out to be a 5-star read. And trust me, I was worrying over that organic/non-organic SecUnit Murderbot every day this week! I had to go a pointless work training class Wednesday, and I was livid because I had to stop in the middle of the chapter!!\n\nAll Systems Red is the 1st installment of The Murderbot Diaries. It’s a space adventure/exploration/mystery novella. It’s entertaining, fast-paced, and quite ingenious. I really needed an exciting read escape at a time like this, one that I can obsess and fangirl over. It’s truly been awhile…probably since my Witcher days, and the void some of my past reading obsessions have left are still open and waiting…\n\nAside from meeting and following Murderbot (my absolute favorite part of the novella), I also appreciated the underlying themes the novella nurtured. Indeed, they were subtle; but it had my ears pricking up and led to plenty of moments of nodding in agreement. The blatant disregard wealthy and greedy corporations have for those around them and the ill effects of capitalistic ideals are a couple of subtle messages I encountered. Being a trapped and unhappy employee of one of America’s largest healthcare corporations and constantly bombarded with hateful humans, I found I could easily relate to Murderbot even if I can only wish I was half as brave as it was hacking its own governor module in order to be free!\n\n♡ “I can’t do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans.”\n\n♡ “But you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.”\n\nLike Murderbot, I’d much rather be isolated and binging TV shows and books.\n\n♡ \"I hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon.\"\n{Sanctuary Moon is one of Murderbot’s favorite serials to watch!}\n\nDid I mention Murderbot is also funny?\n\nMy Questions?\n● I know Apple TV is producing a TV show based on The Murderbot Diaries, but have any developers considered adapting Sanctuary Moon yet?? I would looooove that!\n● How mind-blowing is the thought of an augmented human?! I am absolutely obsessed with that idea! Sign me up please!\n\nTHE ENDING\nHas me hyped up so much for the next novella right away. It was unexpected and heartbreaking yet understandable. I need to know more!!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nThis was an instant escape, a series I can see myself happily invested in for a long time. For me to be saying “oh yay” and then “oh no” in the same sentence, it means I’m fully captivated. I was not on this planet while I was reading this novella. And I won’t lie, the novella even caught me up in the feelies during several moments. So, add a +1 to the Murderbot Fan Club. I’m quite literally obsessed!! Will be continuing the diaries ASAP!\n\n☆2024 Monster Mash Challenge – another one met!☆\n|The Mummy Category|\n◇ Read a book set in space or galaxy. ✔️\n\nShow more\n30 likes\n18 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Daniel Montague\n358 reviews\n32 followers\nFollow\nNovember 11, 2022\nAs someone who periodically dips their foot in the sci-fi genre this fulfilled a need. Overall, I enjoyed this and thought that Martha Wells provided a fun romp but left some meat on the philosophical questions. The protagonist in this story is a robot, whose only function is to provide protection for professionals. In the hierarchy of robot protectors, it is towards the middle in job grade. While, not as impressive as some models that are used for wealthy clients who demand a more bombastic approach it also is not so porous that it is rendered useless. Though thought to be devoid of a personality, this particular robot has a proclivity for soap operas (Sanctuary Moon) and solitude. Without giving away too much of the plot, this robot has fundamentally changed its' proscribed use but this change has fascinating repercussions. The blending of human and machine though a frequent device in literature takes a unique turn in this read. Though this story can stand alone, I am curious to see how Ms. Wells will continue the trajectory of the series. When I am need of another sci-fi hit I will gladly pick up more books in this delightful series.\nShow more\n3-stars\n \nfuture-is-female\n \nmore-human-than-human\n \n...more\n28 likes\nLike\nComment"

I have to thank Carol for bringing me into the fold - MB was referenced in a bunch of other reviews, so I decided to hit it up. Boy, what a joy ride!\n\nFirst of all, Murderbot is totally relatable to me. It makes a great protagonist, it's my new spirit animal, so to say. And the way it mostly not cares (or pretends to not care - MB, you're a softy deep within, I can feel it!) actually makes it a great hero. Well, anti hero, but that is a prominent position. I sometimes think the best heroes are anti heroes.\n\nSo, read this! You won't regret it.\nIf you do not like it, I hereby give you permission to complain about it to me.\n\n* Orders a SecUnit, just in case\n\n+++ Spoiler +++\n\nThe last part off the story was actually not that big a surprise to me. I think leaving it's guardian to be it's own Murderbot actually makes sense in terms of being truly free and ungoverned.\nShow more\nsci-fi\n28 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"

Martha Wells makes us deeply care for Murderbot, a sarcastic, socially awkward, empathetic and relatable hybrid robot/human construct who doesn't give 2 shits about anything but the entertainment feeds and wants to be left alone. Now, who doesn't want that?!\n“I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.”\n\nHighly recommended!

We are introduced to a sarcastic, pessimistic, I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE murderbot that has stolen my heart.\n\nFirstly, I officially think of murderbot as androgynous. I can’t picture a male or female face/body/personality on it and that’s fiiiiiine by me. It’s just murderbot it my brain.\n\nSecondly, this bot has some serious personal space issues and I love it. It truly just wants to be left the fuck alone to watch it’s soap operas. Think Kuzco and his NO TOUCHIE rules and you got murderbot in a nutshell.\n\nThirdly, I was smiling so much while reading this. I absolutely cannot wait to continue the series.\n\nFourthly, just go into this blind. It’ll be fine.

    "text": "TheBookWarren\n550 reviews\n211 followers\nFollow\nMarch 31, 2024\n4.25 ⭐️ (amended in 24’) — A fun, cheeky and somewhat prescient first book in the ‘Murderbot’ Universe, that ultimately delivered on its premise well, abating any inevitable disparity between my personal experience versus expectations, whilst creating an intrigue that will stay with me until I get the opportunity to complete the series, hopefully in the near future, as it is abundantly clear to me now that this series not only has a place in the annals of modern Science Fiction, but in modern Literature as well.\n\nI have been eagerly looking forward to commencing this series — largely due to the incredible number of fellow readers I respect whom adore it — In fact I’d say my interest was more solicitous, as once I held the hardback in my hand I had that tense feeling of wanting to clamp my hands around it strongly and devour the pages!\n\nIt’s fair to say that any time one has an intent for a book that is that veraciousness, things can never truly live up to such a promise. This was certainly the case here — but this is no knock or disparagement — I had hyped it up way way too much and I found the first 30 pages tough as a result.\n\nBut, as one of the beautiful things about literature we all cherish — The novel took on a life of its own, shedding the scales of that ridiculously over-excitable hype of created in my head — I soon began to settle into the very futuristic and bleak world of Murderbot & his human companions.\n\nOn a very distant planet, way out in the universe — our protagonist is escorting a team of human scientists, whom have been tasked with scouring the surface of planets in order to gain as much scientific data as possible. The self labelled ‘murdebot’ — an android made up of the latest tech & software — has hacked its own module, the module that ensures it is self-aware and not completely subservient to the humans as it should be — creating a fun, engaging, easy to follow consciousness where the android is trying to discover who it really is and where it allegiances lie.\n\nThen when a neighbouring mission goes bad, things get serious and it is here where All systems red goes from fun to ferociously-addictive, with twists and turns, black comedy, hopelessness and at its core the central message permeates every plot point, absorbing every paragraph due to it being the heartbeat of all human or non-human consciousness — The search for self, identity, meaning and spirituality, the walk of life!\n\nMurderbot — as discovered this time round, that is read so well by Kevin Free & also brilliantly dramatised in a new late 2023 release — thanks to its magnificent, one-of-a-kind self-consciousness and subsequent rationale, created by its hacking of its own system — is truly a paradox and paradigm, that also has an insatiable appetite for killing — this android is no robot! It’s self-deprecating, has a roller-coasting mental state that feels more human than any of the humans in the story, and becomes the near-perfect flawed protagonist you just cannot help but root for with legitimate passion and fervour — Even upon a recent quick re-read before I tackle Book Two and beyond, it was paramountly evident that Martha Wells world of high-tech, space madness is of a certain genius that perhaps has yet to be fully appreciated for the creative brilliance it deserves.\nShow more\nadult-fiction\n \nai-robot-scifi-fiction\n \nfantasy-sci-fi-futuristic\n \n...more\n27 likes\n5 comments\nLike\nComment"

It be a monthly bookclub here on Goodreads that anyone can join! https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/297482-the-bookbum-club\n\nThis sci-fi novella caught me eye because one of me favourite authors, Ann Leckie, talked about it in one of her blog posts. She states, “This is volume 1 of the Murderbot Diaries, and I suspect a certain percentage of my readers don’t need to hear anything more. Go, purchase, download! You will enjoy this.” Ummm yes I did enjoy this. In fact, I loved it! It is nominated for the 2018 Best Novella Hugo Award (with some amazing others) as well as these other awards:\n\nNebula Award Nominee for Best Novella (2018), Philip K. Dick Award Nominee (2017), ALA Alex Award (2018), Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science Fiction (2017)\n\nNeed anymore convincing? Ye may see that I have not discussed plot, character, or anything else about this novel. I went into it blind and recommend this. For those that must know more, the blurb be below. It does not do this justice. This be basically a perfect read. I have read four out of the six novellas nominated for the Hugo and so far this might be me favourite.\n\nI had heard of Martha Wells before but never read any of her work. Shame on me. I be glad to have remedied this. The next 3 novellas in the series are all scheduled to come out this year. Arrrrr!! I will be reading them all. I only wish that I would have read this sooner.\n\nMuch thanks to the BookBum Club for giving me the incentive to read this delightful “short and sweet” novella (144 pgs.). Day one – challenge complete! Next up: call it courage. Check out that review tomorrow!\n\nSide note: Tor has published 5 of the 6 novellas up for Best Novella this year! Good job Tor.

It felt like an episode of a sci-fi show with its own contained story that after finishing it, one is already queuing up the next one.\n\nI saw this book recommended everywhere sometime after one of its sequels had come out but for some reason the premise didn't pique my interest. It wasn't until I kept seeing more sequels be hyped up and still exceed expectations that I decided I had to start it someday.\n\nThis was my first book by Wells and it definitely won't be the last.\n\n–– Spoilers ––\n\n\nHighlights\n- Murderbot was great, it definitely stole the show, even if it was its to begin with, hahaha. The part where it used the room's cameras to help its shyness with the humans was definitely a mood.\n\n- A robot that is as obsessed with series as humans is definitely something I hadn't expected. Hope to see more references to Sanctuary Moon in other installments.\n\n- Dr. Mensah was a great counterpart to Muderbot as the captain of the survey group. She was calm and collected when needed, and with the help of Murderbot they were able to save the whole crew. She too was my favorite human.\n\n- The pacing was marvelous, it never felt like a chore to keep on reading. I'm eager to read the next ones as I have seen they are much bigger in size than this one.\n\n- The names from Murderbot's humans were intriguing: Overse and Volescu being my favorite of the bunch, name-wise.\n\nNitpicking (jokingly)\n- Dr. Mensah (name sounds like \"dumb/stupid\" in Spanish) and Kilos as a unit of length (Kilo is a unit of mass in Spanish)\n- Weird but lovable names but kept forgetting their genders.\n\nExpectations\n- If the series's hype continues, I definitely can see Murderbot become a staple robot/AI in pop culture.\n- I hope, later rather than sooner, we meet again with the survey group.\n\nShow more\nautomata\n \nfirst-book-by-author\n \nfunny\n \n...more\n26 likes\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Silvana\n1,299 reviews\n1,240 followers\nFollow\nFebruary 16, 2019\nWhat a fun SF novella. I bought this totally on a whim a few days ago when it's on sale since the synopsis and the reviews look promising. Different with other books languishing in my TBR shelf, I decided to read it right away (a record!) since the Kindle sample grabbed my attention.\n\nIt was so funny, if you like dry humour. The snarky, TV-series-bingewatcher 'SecUnit construct' with a penchant of saving its 'humans' because it actually cared. Well, just a bit. Not too much, since it did not even care who they were, or barely read his clients' personnel files (because it needed the storage space for its series collection LOL).\n\nOf course, the Murderbot - as it preferred to call itself - had some other motives for its actions. Still very rational and it knew what it wanted. It is not a lovey dovey relationship with the humans, it even tried really hard not to communicate too much. As an introvert myself, I definitely symphatize with the bot. I too need time to recharge and be alone whenever I have had too many human interaction. And I too, obviously, am crazy about TV series. So, there you go. I have not read too many SF with a POV from a robot so this one is definitely memorable.\n\nAll in all, the novella is sharp, action-packed, has straightforward plot (because why not), no useless space for unnecessary world building, and of course, the characterization of the slightly depressed bot is marvelous - if you like Marvin from the Hitchhiker's novels, you'll like Murderbot. Kate Elliot mentioned in her blurb that All Systems Red is \"clever, inventive, brutal when it needs to be, and compassionate without ever being sentimental.\" I could not agree more.\nShow more\nfemale-nonbinary-authors\n \nfound-family\n \nmine-mine-mine\n \n...more\n26 likes\n5 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Jacob Proffitt\n3,309 reviews\n2,152 followers\nFollow\nDecember 2, 2019\nThis novella has an airy tone that ends up delivering a punchy catharsis. The unnamed SecUnit that calls itself Murderbot is self-contained and wary while it hides that it disabled the governor unit that is supposed to control its actions. So it doesn't have to follow orders but it also doesn't want that fact discovered. So while the adventure/mystery story unfolds at a fast pace an undercurrent of autonomy and identity plays out in the background.\n\nThis undercurrent is highlighted by the group of humans Murderbot is working for/with. They're well-meaning and determined and lead by a woman with strong convictions and a quick mind. So when they discover that it is ungoverned, their reactions range from intrusively sympathetic to actively suspicious, giving the story scope (however slight) to explore those buried themes.\n\nI thought at first that the action/mystery dominated that under-theme but I think Wells ends up using that to build the connection-through-adversity that forms the framework for the eventual resolution. Which delivers that punchy catharsis that brought me all the feelz.\n\nSo I'm giving this an unmitigated five stars, because I'm all about the feelz. But I'll note that the distance between underlying theme (autonomy and identity) and the story frame (action/mystery) in such a short work is enough that it'll be disconcerting to those who want more of one or the other. And I'll agree with Tadiana that the characterization for the rest of the crew is shallow. But I didn't care. I was all about the Murderbot/Mensah connection and that ending slew me.\nShow more\naction\n \nmystery\n \nsci-fi\n27 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"

A main character I can relate to.\n\nI have very little to say about this one to be honest. The action was fun and fast-paced, the world-building was interesting and easily digestible, and of course, the main character, dearest Murderbot, was marvelous.\n\nAs an autistic person, I dislike when autistic people are compared to robots. But also as an autistic person, it was almost impossible for me not to notice the parallels.\nMurderbot hating eye contact and struggling with facial expressions, not understanding 'basic' etiquette, their love of serials and often using the serials to understand the world around them.\n\nGetting to read a story in which a character with these traits is readily accepted and welcomed by those around them just gave me so many warm, fuzzy feelings.\n\nMy only real complaint is that I wish I got to know the crew a little better. Though, with the word count and the size of the crew, I suppose it's understandable. Hopefully they make another appearance in one of the many other Murderbot installments. Which I will absolutely be reading.\n\nMurder, schmurder. In my eyes, Murderbot can do no wrong.\nShow more\n27 likes\nLike\nComment"

Especially with Dr Mensa who is such an awesome character that she rates as Murderbot’s favourite human. In the book she is confident, decisive, smart and careful with Murderbot and crew, also objectively more likeable and capable than the series. Very disappointed but not at all surprised. The book is better by a long shot for any inquiring minds that may be pondering. Lowkey hate how the crew are dismissed as hippies and idiots. Won’t be bothering with other episodes 😕\n\nReread 2023…still really love this and Murderbot’s character is perfection for me.\n\n\nThis was awesome! Loved the main character so much! She was everything I love in a character, sarcastic, indifferent, loyal, complex. And the story pretty much zinged along.

    "text": "I’m a book mom\n86 reviews\n12 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 12, 2025\nI was recommended this book by someone who said that the main character — an introverted, socially anxious self-hacking half robot — reminded him of me. And I must say, he was correct. The self-proclaimed “murderbot” was humorous, loved binge watching tv, and found the humans irritating while simultaneously needing to protect them. Like the SecUnit, I am self aware, so I understand why this character compares to me. Though, to my knowledge, I am fully human and not a cyborg. Anyway, I don’t typically say this, but I actually think this book is better suited as a script for a tv series. The book itself was fairly boring, but I could visualize the potential on-screen impact. I look forward to watching the series and hope it can make a 3 star book, a 5 star televisual experience.\nShow more\n27 likes\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Jack\nAuthor \n6 books\n149 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 14, 2017\nWell that was a fun little diversion. And by little, I mean LITTLE! This is, hands down, the shortest book I've read all year. And also probably the easiest read I've done all year. Given my penchant for reading large and/or heady books, this one was pretty much a \"blink and you'll miss it\" deviation for me. It was also our book club pick following the behemoth that was Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, and we chose it because it was an easy read, which we felt was necessary after wading through the 1000+ pages of TWoK.\n\nSo what did I think of All Systems Red? Well, it was...good. That's about the best I can come up with at the moment. I loved the idea of a rogue Security bot that hacked its own governor, stopped caring about the corporate mission, and decided to basically be a TV junkie. And the fact that it refers to itself as Murderbot was just priceless. But outside of those concepts, the story just didn't really move me like I hoped it would.\n\nPart if this is, I'm sure, due to the brevity of the tale. There's not a lot of room for character arcs or deep plotting in a story this short. And I get it...it's not supposed to be a monster story. This is popcorn entertainment, and it achieves that goal rather well. But, that being said, I still was left feeling a little cold after reading All Systems Red. Nobody really gets any backstory or context, the people in the tale are essentially just random people who are assigned various archetypes and behaviors to stand out. I never got much of a visual of any of them. As for Murderbot, while admired the snarky way in which it narrated its tale, I still wanted to know more about it, and this never really came to pass.\n\nAnother thing that took away from my enjoyment is the way in which the narrative unfolds. I've read several books where the storytelling was...incidental at best. But All Systems Red takes the cake. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was just kind of half-explained or defined. From the action to the locations to the characters themselves, nothing is written in much detail. In fact, the action scenes were comprised mostly of passages that read something like \"I ran at it while shooting my projectile weapon. It was shooting at me at the same time. I got hit a few times, but I managed to find a vital area on my opponent and take it down.\" And...that's it. The problem with writing like this is it robs the story of any sense of drama or suspense. It's all so...casual. And that casual writing makes the narrative casual as well, which doesn't help to engage the reader as much.\n\nBecause this is a short novella, we jump from sequence to sequence pretty quickly, but even on things that I felt should have been given more weight, Martha Wells just kinda glosses over them. Not having read any of her other works, I can't say if this is just how she writes, or if she had to constrain herself to keep the story short & sweet. Again, I wanted more.\n\nBut it's not all bad! Murderbot is a fun narrator, and carries the first person POV tale quite well. I enjoyed the snark, the sarcasm, and the flippancy in which it viewed most situations it found itself in. I loved how anti-social Murderbot was, and how it really just wanted to be left alone to watch its video entertainment...aka soap operas.\n\nThe overall concept is also rather cool, but I feel that this could have been far more impactful as either a full-length novel or a larger novella. I wanted more heft with my tale, and I never received that. But I can see the potential here, and given that this is the first in a series of books, I think Martha Wells can certainly take this character in interesting directions. The ending of this one opens up all sorts of possibilities, and I'd like to see what is next for Murderbot.\nShow more\n26 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Ila Perey\nAuthor \n1 book\n27 followers\nFollow\nJuly 2, 2025\nMurderbot is a sentient humanoid robot. It must figure out humans and how to act robot to keep his sentience a secret, not least because it had disabled certain modules in order to preserve its exercise of free will and a mortal’s sense of self-preservation amongst others. At the root, it now has to grapple with having opinions and feelings which necessitates understanding the nuances of human interactions including facial expressions and reading between the lines in order preserve its secret and later, to express his opinions and cooperate with humans to investigate possible breaches, criminal or fraudulent activities. In other words, Murderbot demonstrates both primary and secondary thinking by understanding learned behaviours, social conventions and personal goals as it deduces human and corporate motives.\n\nMurderbot feels beyond basic feelings and emotions which extends to disgust, betrayal and even a fiddly form of empathy. Like an introvert, it prefers solitude because it gets overwhelmed or rather, irritated with social interactions, preferring to spend time doing what it wills. Its relationship with humans can be described as a form of reverse anthropomorphism—humans don’t know how to categorise it and thus, the appropriate way to act around it while the murderbot tries to blend in with the humans as an android with hilarious results. Consequently, the book provides an opportunity to look into the human condition, facilitated by the juxtaposition of an augmented human character. Readers could then decide at what point a person or a robot becomes a machine and ceases to be human or vice versa, along with the ethical implications.\n\nWriting as a socially awkward human, murderbot tickles me when it analyses, quite ungracefully, (romantic) interpersonal relations, the surrounding drama and a series called ‘sanctuary moon’ it obsessively follows. The series is fascinating and I cannot wait to read and watch the rest of it.\nShow more\n28 likes\nLike\nComment"

Esa es la sensación que me ha transmitido este libro. Estoy sumamente confuso, no porque la historia sea confusa, sino porque no tengo claro si la historia va sobre algo en absoluto.\n\nLos Diarios de Matabot, hasta donde estoy viendo, es una de esas series que tienen múltiples relatos protagonizados por un personaje principal carismático y encariñable. En este caso es una SegUnidad, un robot de seguridad que ha hackeado su propio módulo de control y ahora posee libertad de pensamiento y acción. Y esa libertad de pensamiento y acción la usa en ver telebasura todo el día mientras pasa totalmente de los humanos que le han puesto al cargo. ¿Hace su trabajo? Sí. ¿Se preocupa de hacer bien su trabajo? También. Pero su preocupación primaria es el culebrón.\n\nMatabot es directamente adorable, rehuyendo del contacto humano como de la peste y con un carácter claramente introvertido. Es imposible no leer la primera página del libro y caer rendido a sus pies. Por desgracia, el resto de la novela, tanto en términos de historia como de personajes, no pueden seguirle el ritmo, y la sensación que queda al final es que te hallas en una historia de ciencia ficción ligeramente cutre sobre un equipo de científicos atrapados en un planeta donde una amenaza desconocida intenta matarles, pero en compañía del mejor robot que he visto en ficción desde Bender de Futurama.\n\nAfortunadamente, el relato es corto, de apenas ciento cincuenta páginas. Es la longitud adecuada para disfrutar de Matabot y sus aventuras mientras al mismo tiempo no te aburres por un pelo. En general, mi opinión es \"meh\". Adoro a Matabot, no me gusta todo lo demás. Creo que debería reseñar este.\nShow more\nawesome-mc\n \nboring\n \nmaterial-de-review\n \n...more\n25 likes\nLike\nComment"

It's really interesting to experience a story from the viewpoint of a robot. I loved how (I'm going to call it a she because I felt like the bot was female presenting) really just wanted to do her job and watch her soap operas. How relatable was that?\n\nAnyway, this book rocked. It has was short and sweet. It had me laughing at Murderbot's POV and how she interacted with and viewed her humans that she was protecting. She's pretty badass and has a killer sense of humor. I feel like we could be friends because I often just want to be left alone and allowed to watch tv or paint or draw or sew doll clothes and not deal with people. I love how she didn't read the software updates because she didn't care enough. It's so so relatable. She used a lot of her memory to download her soap opera videos that she liked to watch. LOL! For what it's worth, I think this would make a good series or movie. Netflix are you paying attention?\n\nI gave it 4.5 stars because there were some parts I felt a little confused, and I wished it was longer.\nShow more\n1st-person-pov\n \n2021-action-adventure-aficionados-c\n \n2021-action-heroine-fans-yearly-cha\n \n...more\n29 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"

It uses its freedom to keep doing its job while watching series on its memory storage. It doesn't really care about its job as a SecUnit, protecting humans who go on scientific explorations, and is quite content being ignored and seen as a robot, because when human interaction starts it gets complicated.\n\nThe plot of this novella is compelling. Things keep going wrong on the expedition, and the humans Murderbot works for are a bit different that the ones it usually encounters.\n\nMurderbot's pessimism, its tendency towards anxiety and depression, mixed with the care and affection it develops towards who it begins to consider its humans, is endearing (even if it sounds like it's not), relateable, and often leads to comedic moments born from the first person narration.\n\nThe book is just so much fun to read, and while its plot is mostly self contained, it also acts as a wonderful setup for the rest of the series.\nHighly, highly recommend this one!\nShow more\nasexual-spectrum\n \naudio\n \ncomfort-reads\n \n...more\n25 likes\nLike\nComment"

Murderbot's such a fun, and--yeah--relatable character. I'm looking forward to continuing on with the rest of the novellas in this series.\n\n(My mini-review from the first read is below the *.)\n\n*\n\nThe cyborg protagonist of \"All Systems Red\" is hired on, or rented, to act as security for a small survey team exploring a new planet. The autopilot on the team's transport is sabotaged while they are exploring an anomaly on the survey map, leading to an investigation into who might have done it, and why.\n\n\"Murderbot\" reminds me somewhat of Breq in the Imperial Radch trilogy, especially in how its interactions with humans, and its variance from others of its kind, open up questions of what \"identity\" means. Its lackadaisical attention to detail, its frequent criticisms of how cheap the company that created it is, and its awkwardness with the crew, made this story surprisingly charming and funny.\n\nThe ending was perfect for a novella, closing off this chapter for Murderbot, and making me anxious to see where it goes to next.\n\nThis was my second Martha Wells (the other was City of Bones quite a while ago), and I'm glad there are plenty more yet to read.

As I have discovered while listening to other favourite books, it gives a different perspective on something I thought I knew well. New things seem to gain prominence in the audio version.\n\nI enjoyed Kevin R. Free as narrator. He managed to provide a calm, soothing version of Murderbot which is rather ironic considering how much turmoil and anxiety lurks beneath our favourite bot's surface. The pronunciation of the occasional word reminded me that I'm Canadian and he's American, but that's par for the course. It's a tiny thing in an otherwise lovely performance. Note to self: check to see the other books that he has narrated and consider adding some to my TBR. My only reservation is that his smooth voice lulled me to sleep as I was attempting to stay up past bedtime to finish the book. I had to rewind and resume the story once I had the ability to pay attention to it again.\n\nAlready, I have requested the audio format of Book 2. The recordings are popular, so it will be a while.

In this one, we follow a crew that is on a planet doing research on this planet. Included in this crew is Murderbot who is part human and part robot. Murderbot is not your typical robot unit as this unit has cut off its connection to a governor module which controls actions. Basically, Murderbot has freewill.\n\nWhat a terrific introduction to this new series. The selling point so far was the point of view. The point of view is from Murderbot and I absolutely loved it. To see the action from a point of view that was not totally human had me immediately interested in the story. Even though the main character isn't totally human we get to see whether the main character wants to binge watch a series and the interaction with humans. It was an excellent look into human interaction and also a question of sentience. The only reason I could not give this a full five stars was that this wasn't a full length novel. This needed some more world building and also more development of the minor characters. That being said, I was enthralled throughout.\n\nI have seen this series constantly in my Goodreads feed and I finally thought I would give it a try. This is another example of why I love Goodreads because I probably would have never known about this series. I loved it and this easily fits into my science fiction itch. I am a fan and I really look forward into the second offering.\nShow more\n24 likes\nLike\nComment"

I've read this book so many times now that I should be able to recite parts of it! I certainly know when to expect what. Somehow this recording felt shorter than the one narrated by Kevin R Free, but I checked and they are the same length.\n\nDavid Cui Cui did a good job of inhabiting Murderbot. I could tell Gurathin and Ratthi apart quite easily. Ratthi had a light Scots accent, while Gurathin had a much deeper voice. It was the women's voices that I struggled with. Eventually I got Mensah sorted out and sometimes Pin-Lee, but mostly because I know a lot of the dialogue by heart, not because the voices were clearly different.\n\nStill, it was another enjoyable visit with Murderbot and I have requested Artificial Condition: Dramatized Adaptation. These are popular, so I'm going to be waiting a while, but that's fine by me. I'll be ready when the loan is.\nShow more\naudiobooks\n \nfavourites\n \nfemale-authors\n \n...more\n24 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"

Furthermore, it needed to be around 3 hours in length, as we planned to listen while we worked on a jigsaw puzzle this afternoon and we wanted to complete a full story experience with a beginning, middle and ending, rather than starting something we couldn't finish.\n\nI entered my search criteria into Google and considered the results. I was pleased to discover this one was already on my to read list on good reads. Our interest was piqued while listening to an excerpt and it was available for download on Hoopla through our local public library.\n\nWe quickly became engaged in the story and there were many laughs out loud along the way. Great narration by Kevin R. Free enhanced our listening experience. The language and vocabulary were captivating and the characters came to life in our imaginations. We love that we can repeat this experience as there are more volumes in this series!\n\nPhrase that consistently made me laugh, \"non-organic parts.\"\nShow more\nscience-fiction\n24 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "David\n787 reviews\n383 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 5, 2018\nHaving killed a handful of company employees on his previous job the self-described Murderbot quietly hacks it's own governor module and essentially becomes a petulant, self-conscious emo teenager that would rather watch soap operas than deal with humans. One armed with military grade weapons and defensive systems mind you.\n\nNow on a planetary mission where things aren't adding up, the crew including Murderbot find themselves in mortal danger. Murderbot having gifted him/herself with free will is no longer restricted to following orders but still works to keep his/her human crew safe. The book doesn't overstay its welcome and manages to pack a tight little story in under 200 pages. And it looks like its building a world that will continue on with a new book slated for this year. A quick sci-fi hit.\nShow more\n24 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"

It likes its personal space and get's uncomfortable when it has to talk to humans directly. This story was entertaining from cover to cover. It was fun and humorous and VERY relatable. It was effortlessly diverse.\n\nI was really impressed with the pacing of the story through most of it. The pacing did get a little rushed (even for a novella) towards the end, but I still enjoyed how the story actually ended and will definitely continue with the series.\nShow more\n2020\n \nsci-fi\n23 likes\nLike\nComment"

He’s not the only SecUnit in this universe, but he might be the only one who thinks on his own *spoilers*.\nThe plot of the book is of the kind “there-is-something-fishy-happening-there” and is spent on uncovering that mystery.\nI like the personality of the Murderbot and the people whom he was servicing were also well written, each having it’s unique personality.\nWill be taking up the series to explore more adventures of the Murderbot 😁\nShow more\n24 likes\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "Allie\n145 reviews\n160 followers\nFollow\nJuly 7, 2021\nMartha Wells’ novella about a disaffected robot struggling with identity issues is like a set of Russian nesting dolls: there are stories within stories. It's an impressive accomplishment and Wells says more in 144 pages than most authors do in their 1,000-page trilogies.\n\nThe main story arc is a high-octane adventure about a sentient robot assigned to protect a group of scientists on their survey of a planet from sabotage, man-eating wildlife, and armed invaders from another company determined to take control of the planet at any cost. But the SecUnit assigned to protect the small survey group is a rogue agent with some serious psychological issues…MURDERBOT.\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nMurderbot is the AI version of the sensitive loner in high school. The edgy introvert who would rather read Jack Kerouac than attend social events. Lightning fast and armed with energy cannons, Murderbot is a fighting machine that doesn’t want to fight. It’s a reluctant hero who would rather be left alone to watch media, but it feels a responsibility to get the hapless humans to safety. Like so many readers, I related to Murderbot from page one and loved its sarcastic sense of humor. Despite its preference for mainlining galactic soap operas, there are plenty of gun fights and last-minute rescues for readers who want a fun adventure story.\n\nI knew I could kill everyone on the hopper, even with a blown hip joint and one working arm. So I grabbed the hand weapon on the seat, turned it toward my chest, and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe second story arc is about free will, personhood, and the future of AI. SecUnits like Murderbot are leased out by their corporate owners to protect human clients; they are considered property rather than people. While robots can be citizens in some territories outside corporate space, they are second-class citizens at best who are required to have human guardians. Sentience and the desire for self-determination are not sufficient for bots to be free or equal to humans. The author contrasts Murderbot’s experience with Gurathin, a human cyborg on the survey team. While both Murderbot and Gurathin are part organic and part machine, Gurathin is a citizen with all the attendant rights, simply because he was born human. Murderbot was built in a lab, so it despite its intelligence, cloned human tissue, and the ability to have feelings, it is considered a machine no different than a PC. Murderbot is trying to decide who it wants to be and how it wants to live in a society that doesn't allow it to make either of those decisions.\n\nIt’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. That makes it sound like the halves are discrete…as opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity.\n\nFinally, and least developed, is the story arc about the future of humanity after we colonize space. Given the page limits of a novella, Wells just sketches in brief outlines of humanity and governance across various worlds. The book takes place in the Corporate Rim, where multi-planet companies rule and money is the only thing that matters. Murderbot blandly notes that the company that leased it to the survey group would certainly take bribes from an opposing survey group and says the only reason the company wouldn’t conspire to murder its clients is because the death payouts would be too high. Meanwhile, the survey group is from a democratic planet called Perseverance in non-corporate space, which values human rights, decency, and the rule of law. Bots have limited rights under those laws, and the survey group wants Murderbot to return with them to their liberal planet. Basically, you have unchecked capitalism vs. democratic socialism as co-existing philosophies in space, although it's unclear how that happened.\n\nI’m docking half a star because I enjoy complex world-building (e.g., John Scalzi) and would have loved to read more about the different star systems. I also felt that most of the secondary characters were underdeveloped. I wish Wells had written a full-length novel that fleshed out the characters, especially Mensah, the courageous and compassionate team leader who bonds most closely with Murderbot. But these are mere quibbles; the book is fantastic and I have already started reading the next novella in the series.\n\n4.5 heartwarming stars.\nShow more\nsci-fi\n23 likes\n21 comments\nLike\nComment"
