THE WRITING IS MEDIOCRE SHIT TOO.\n\nBarely any description about what the technology actually looks like. There is also no description on the settings either. There were other things I hated, but the story having no description was the worst part.\n\nThe main character is a murderbot that has social anxiety. It's not done in a relatable way at all. \"Omg they hate me because I'm a robot\". It's just said over and over again that the main character feels awkward around humans.\n\nLater on the story points out that since the main character is a robot it has no gender and doesn't care about sex. Again there's a whole paragraph on this and it doesn't feel naturally integrated into the story at all. \"Look I'm trying to be diverse\". Yeah it's a robot of course it doesn't have to have a gender. Another thing is that the main character reads actually like a girl so this whole gender neutral thing is not working out. I'm not actually sure what a murderbot is yet, but I'm not reading the whole thing to find out.\nShow more\n1-star\n \ndnf\n119 likes\n22 comments\nLike\nComment"

It is about time, yeah? Only a thousand reviews to add onto that site. www.jillyshmilly.blogspot.com\n\nThis book takes several pages to get acclimated, and also to get some understanding of our narrator. He (I'm using \"he\" although Murderbot doesn't have a gender) is part human/part robot and is really very much like April Ludgate on Parks and Rec, or maybe a honey badger, because Murderbot just don't give a shit.\n\n\n\n\nMurderbot must also be American, and possibly a teenager because he also does the bare minimum possible when it comes to his job.\n\n...all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day..\n\nIf by \"entertainment feed\", it means that it wants to hang out on the internet when it's not reading or binge-watching Netflix, I think they may have cloned me to make Murderbot. I sure as hell approve of his hobbies, and his name. He chose his own name. It's catchy, I like it.\n\n\n\nHehe! Oh, you!\n\nUnfortunately for Murderbot, someone is trying to kill the humans that he's supposed to protect in between soap opera episodes. That sucks.\n\nI've got four perfectly good humans here and I didn't want them to get killed...it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.\n\nPriorities, you know. Permanent records are permanent.\n\n\n\n\nSo, Murderbot has to do some work, and he has to interact with humans - his two least favorite activities.\n\n\n\n\nThis story was short, but funny if you love depressed robots with low self-esteem.\n\n\nShow more\nnovella\n \nsci-fi\n122 likes\n28 comments\nLike\nComment"

I'm far more interested in how the characters act/behave/ survive in this world that is unfamiliar to me. Good scifi hits the ground running giving the reader enough credit to keep up as the author slowly metes out the world building while setting a very dynamic conflict.\nMy favorite scifi of late is Old Man's War, what a great read (along with the two followups). All systems Red is on this same level for me. The story starts off at a run and doesn't let up until the end. I loved it.\nThe minor problem for me is that in normal story arcs there are four sections, conflict, complication, crisis, and conclusion. This book has the crisis and the conclusion it runs so hot at such a frenetic pace the whole book feels like the crisis in the arc. Because of this the final crisis fizzles or pales to some of the wonderful earlier action scenes. This also happened for me in the book, Passages. The scene on train in that book made the ending feel like a fizzle. But oh, was that train scene something else.\nDoesn't matter though, I picked all the other Martha Wells books. She can really write a strong female character that is viewed through the eyes of a murderbot.\nDavid Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series.\nShow more\n122 likes\n13 comments\nLike\nComment"

I have so many books to read but I could not keep looking at this book just sitting on my Kindle. Plus, it’s only a novella. I can put off my ARC’s long enough to read a novella right? Well, that’s at least how I convinced myself to read this today. While this book was good sci-fi fun, what really made the read special for me was Murderbot. Only one novella and a short story read and I’m already in love with Murderbot. The story had some good action and a decent sci-fi plot, but Murderbot was the main attraction. I can’t wait to see what they are up to next and I have a feeling the books will only get better. I already have had to fight with myself since I want to start book 2 right away.

No sooner have we met and loved Murderbot, than a creature attacks them.\nThe hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun.\nMurderbot is sometimes good at its job, so it rescues its charges and goes on its way.\n\nThere's one thing about Murderbot though, all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\n\nFor some reason, the universe is conspiring to keep Murderbot away from its TV shows. It's all it lives for. All it cares for, liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\n\nThis is the samest same I have ever samed. It's a lot easier to deal with fictional characters. They're limited to the realm of your imagination and when you don't want to deal with them you just don't think about them. But some characters sneak past that barrier. They thrive beyond your escapism and latch themselves onto you like a barnacle. Some annoy you. Some fascinate you. Some turn you on. But most importantly, some are you.\n\nI am Murderbot. Patron saint of all antisocial introverts everywhere who just want to be left alone. But Murderbot is too- special. It deserves friends. It deserves joy, freedom and all the things we're told to live for. Will it get them?

    "text": "Noelia (thisbookishlove)\n45 reviews\n638 followers\nFollow\nAugust 9, 2025\nAs most people finally hopping onto this in 2025, I've came into the knowledge of this book because of the recently released Apple tv show.\nBesides, Alexander Skarsgård stars in it as the so called Murderbot, so, as you must have already figured out, reading this was an absolute MUST.\n\nThing is, and the trend that seems to be my reading life this year (sadly) that I don't think this was what I expected. At all. Again.\n\nBear with me.\n\nWe follow the story of Murderbot (as he privately calls himself), a cyborg who has gone rogue, hacking its governor module, as he serves as a SecUnit to a survey team of humans in an (apparently) unexplored planet.\n\nAs a SecUnit his main function is to provide security to the humans he's assigned to, but things go south when a series of anomalies start to happen to the team, forcing him to go beyond his usual task as security and facing him face to face with his biggest fear: to connect.\n\nAnd that's it. That's the book's premise. Given that this is what we call a novella (it runs at 92 pages on my kindle), things happen very very fast. So fast that we have little to no time at all to adapt to this new world, or to get to know the rest of the characters a little bit better. Least say to connect to them or even care about them. The book jumps from one scene to another, with us readers thrown in the midst of the action almost as the get go.\n\nAll we get to know is Murderbot, and his quirkiness, his reffusal to basic human interactions, how little he cares about almost anything and anyone (or that´s what he says) and his addiction to binge watch entertainment media, specially a tv show called Sanctuary Moon.\n\nThe bot is the absolute highlight of this story and the sole reason to keep on reading this series. He's funny just as much as he's awkward and completely unusual. I bet that some introverts will feel seen in his behavior.\n\nAs I stated above my problem with this book is the lack of depth, and that's on its length. It comprises in less than 100 pages what other stories take at least 350 pages to tell. Or even more. So, you see my problem here.\nI would've loved to know a little more of this world or the side characters motivations, their personalities, beyond what we are told, but I guess it is what it is.\n\nOverall, a very light scifi adventure who serves as introduction for an exciting series, or that´s what I heard. And that's what I hope. Fingers crossed.\n\nOne more thing. Murderbot is sexless, so don't expect anything dirty or naughty happening between these pages. At all.\n\nQuality based rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4 stars)\nLiked based rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4 stars)\nShow more\n106 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"

I just found out that Ms. Wells has sold a total of four (count em (4)) novellas in the Murderbot series with the second titled \"Artificial Condition\" (16.99 for a hardcover and 9.99 for the kindle) to appear somewhere near the beginning of 2018 and upon a bit of research found the the book here at GR ->\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...?\n\nBook 3 is scheduled to be a hardcover titled \"Rogue Protocol\" (The Murderbot Diaries #3) found here -->\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...\n\nand also priced at 16.99 (for 160 pages) print and ten bucks for the kindle. (Aug 7, 2018) then book 4 \"Exit Strategy\" (The Murderbot Diaries #4) prior to years end.\n\nWhat have I gotten myself into ?\n\nEntry #2\n\nWell now I'm 100 pages into the book and quite enjoying it. I also found an interview with Ms. Wells. Here is one of the questions regarding this book:\n\nQ: Has there been any interest in turning All Systems Red into a movie or TV show?\n\nA: No, there’s been no interest that I know of. I’m not sure what would work best, though a movie or TV show would have to have a lot of voiceover, since so much of the story is internal to the main character.\n\nQ: If this did happen, who would you like to see play the main characters and why them?\n\nA: I’m not sure who would play Murderbot. I was always kind of imagining Viola Davis [Suicide Squad] for Dr. Mensah. In the story, Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon, is meant to be a far future version of How To Get Away With Murder.\n\nEntry # 3\n\nI have read a couple of times now, in two different interviews, that Ms. Wells credits that murderbot was inspired by Tanith Lee's \"Silver Metal Lover\" and Tanith Lee's writing in general. Ms. Wells has grown in stature in my reading opinion.\n\nThis book was certainly well written and an entertaining story and I totally look forward to the next installment of this series.\nShow more\n2017-09-books-bought\n101 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"

I could easily understand the political structure, where security units fit, the governing module, Peservation Society, the tech, the social rules, and medical capabilities just from following along with the plot. What is most gripping about the story is the juxtaposition of a character designed to protect humans who can't actually stand them. Murderbot is also completely untethered to its programming, and so wouldn't even have to continue protecting humans, but does so for mysterious reasons, and is only really interested in watching TV. I love speculative fiction that can give social commentary on the present, and so many of us can probably relate to Murderbot—compelled to serve society, while kind of detesting fellow humans, and only actually being motivated to rot at home. What a weirdly contradictory mode of being. And yet, Murderbot is capable, heroic, and likable. The character is so gripping, I may just have to continue with the series. Even though I find the plot to be predictable and simplistic, and the emotional impact to be non-existent. I also don't like any of the other characters, who don't seem developed or to get arcs. As a reader who likes earnest stories, deep themes, and epic scope, a cozy sci-fi probably isn't going to be my cup of tea. But Murderbot is a complex and intriguing enough character that I could see myself coming back for future installments just to see what the character will do next.\nShow more\nsci-fi\n101 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"

The plot's straight-forward, the prose is decent, and it's charming and witty. Murderbot, who repeatedly says that she'd rather be netflixing, is surprisingly relatable. One of my favorite parts is when Murderbot is faced with the prospect of spending time with people and is (understandably) horrified. She can't control her facial reaction which in turn makes the human crew she's assigned to uncomfortable to know that they're making Murderbot uncomfortable (and that she has feelings as human as any of them).\n\nAlso, I've just realized that I've been using female pronouns for Murderbot, when Murderbot is actually genderless and is referred to as 'it' by the crew. For some reason I naturally thought of Murderbot as being female and I'm not sure why, maybe because the author is a woman?\n\nPosted in Mr. Philip's Library\nShow more\n2017-releases\n \nauthor-woman\n \nhugo\n \n...more\n99 likes\n18 comments\nLike\nComment"

As the fast-paced, action-packed tale unfolds, a clever mystery emerges, raising the stakes and leading to a surprisingly intense climax. However, what truly makes this novella shine is the witty writing and the main character, Murderbot. With an endearing mix of awkwardness, sarcasm, and an unexpectedly kind heart, Murderbot made the story engaging and relatable. The remaining characters serve their purpose in advancing the plot but did not leave a lasting impression, especially with their unconventional names that made them tricky for me to remember. \n\n\"Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings.

After finishing I have this compulsion on going on until I re-re-re.... listened to all available books in the series.\n\nI know. It's a hard life, so I need more Murderbot in my life.\n\n-------------------\nOriginal review.\n\nWooo-hoooo. What a great read/listening: intense & exciting!\n\nThe Narrator is superb & enhances the experience.\n\n\"With my cracked governor there was nothing to stop me, but not letting anybody, especially the people who held my contract, know that I was a free agent was kind of important. Like, not having my organic components destroyed and the rest of me cut up for parts important.\"\n\nFirst a confession I have to make: I am not that much into the sci-fi genre. I have had my (rare) moments and as the books I read were usually recommended to me by GR friends, they did not disappoint.\nStill, the encounters between me and the genre have not been that intense, but I truly mean to improve and I think The Murderbot Diaries are just going to be my ticket to venture into this territory more.\n\nI have been quite fascinated with Murderbot, the grouchy construct? creature? in-between? (It has organic parts to its body), who/what? is a kind of Ebenezer Scrooge of the universe (a slight exaggeration, but still relatable) who thinks It is indifferent to humans and their probelms. It is uncomforatble around them and hates to let Its guard (=armour) down.\n\n\"I got my helmet on and opaqued it. The relief was intense, about even with finding out that the combat override module had been removed. I love you, armor, and I’m never leaving you again.\"\n\nYet, there is something definitely lurking among Its circuits, organic and non-organic parts that makes you care about It and that makes It -though unwillingly- care about others: namely the bunch of scientist It is contracted to guard on a planet.\n\n\"They were the first clients I’d had who hadn’t had any previous experience with SecUnits, so maybe I could have expected this if I’d bothered to think about it. Letting them see me without the armor had been a huge mistake.\"\n\n\"Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\"\n\nAs we see all the human characters through Murderbot's screen/visor/whatever, it is pretty hard to distinguish them from one another -apart from Mensah and Guriath- but on the other hand, this just showcases that author Martha Wells really knows what's what.\nShow more\naudiobook\n \nfavourites\n \nscience-fiction\n \n...more\n92 likes\n7 comments\nLike\nComment"

And, well, I think I actually liked it! Go figure. I loved the humor and Murderbot seems pretty cool for, you know, a murderbot.\n\nI'm even going to read the second book in the series, Artificial Condition, for another reading challenge prompt (a book with nonhuman characters), which probably says something about how enjoyable this one is.\n\nSo, yeah.

    "text": "Robin (Bridge Four)\n1,940 reviews\n1,659 followers\nFollow\nApril 24, 2020\nRereading Just in Time for the Next Book in this Series.\n\nJust as much fun the second time around. Short, action packed and just enough of a story to make you fall for a Murderbot.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nI totally enjoyed this. As a book recommended to me by multiple good reads friends I knew that there was a high probability that would happen but what I didn’t expect was to fall in love with a SecUnit (fancy talk for cyborg) with a malfunctioning governors unit (more fancy talk for something that makes you behave).\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nMurderbot is assigned to a group of humans exploring a planet to see if it can be terraformed for a new colony. It is basically doing the least amount of work possible, just half-assing everything more worried about the serials it is watching that doing its job. Really it is just going through the motions for most things until everything starts going wrong for the team it is protecting and now Murderbot has to step up their game or all of the humans will end up dead and it will end up reprogrammed or worse.\n\nThe humans in the party notice that something is maybe a little off about Murderbot just after one of its members is almost eaten by a huge wormish thing and all the trouble starts. Murderbot doesn’t enjoy one on one interaction with the team at all and it is hilarious some of the stuff it thinks while trying to learn how to by an integral member of the team and keep them alive.\n\n“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.”\n\nThe story is short but completely entertaining. It is what I always hope I’ll find in a SciFi book but rarely do. A fun story with a great cast of characters that doesn’t get too caught up on the geekiness factor and try to overexplain everything. This was just a great ride with a funny, pessimistic cyborg that has problems dealing with real people and prefers to hide behind an opaqued mask. I can totally relate to most of that anyway. But Murderbot is completely endearing in their own way.\n\n“Gurathin turned to me. \"So you don't have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\"\nI looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”\n\nI’m completely hooked and will definitely catch up on the series as this seems like it is going to be a great ride.\n\nD.G. was the first friend to recommend this to me but not the last so thanks for the great recommendation guys.\nShow more\n4-5-stars\n \nawesome-audio\n \nbeautifully-broken-bastards\n \n...more\n86 likes\n14 comments\nLike\nComment"

Through the eyes of \"Murderbot\" (she's named herself that way), we experience what it is like to work with and for humans, that humans come in all forms (good and bad and everything in between), what the company creating these robots programs them to do (and what not) - and, ultimately, we learn how confusing and difficult it is to find oneself.\n\nMurderbot doesn't like humans very much. But it isn't hatred - rather, confusion. Add to that that she is SHY! Yep, a security bot made to kill people (and other stuff) is actually shy and would rather watch TV. *lol*\n\nThe writing was fast-paced and engaging, every character lively and distinct (not always easy, especially not in short stories) and the unobtrusive humour was delightful.\n\nI will definitely continue reading this series after the great ending to this and can't wait to know more about Murderbot's adventures and self-discovery that also teach us a lot about what it is to be \"human\".\nShow more\n86 likes\n42 comments\nLike\nComment"

Because I fell in love with a Murderbot.\n\nIn All Systems Red, the first volume of The Murderbot Diaries, Martha Wells has created an unforgettable character: that of Murderbot. A self-aware security android, Murderbot has recently hacked into its very own governor module in order to achieve a bit more autonomy. And while on its latest planetary mission – a security detail in which the primary task is to protect a group of scientists – both Murderbot and the scientific team are forced to examine what it means to be human.\n\nBeing a slim novella, Wells’s story is fast-paced and instantly entertaining. But though it may be short in length, it’s long on humor and human insight. Murderbot is quite funny and so very keen to point out the flaws and ineptitudes of the human race. I couldn’t get enough of its quips.\n\nI listened to All Systems Red on audio, and Kevin Free’s narration is spot on. It’s a quick listen and ideal for anyone interested in trying out a little sci-fi.\n\nAnd in case you’re wondering, you can bet I’ll be listening to Book #2, Artificial Condition. More Murderbot is a must.\nShow more\non-my-kindle\n83 likes\n53 comments\nLike\nComment"

And narrates a delightfully fun, filmic sci-fi\nNobody was touching my humans & My clients are the best clients\n\nThe heart of this novella is definitely the sarcastic narration of Murderbot, who has very strong K-2SO vibes, the sarcastic droid from Star Wars Rogue One.\nEarly on this droid (with organic components) already notes: As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\nThis is definitely true, 35.000 hours of entertainment is more interesting than killing to this droid, and later on we learn that this is only a SecUnit, not really an entity meant for heavy duty military work (I’m not a combat Murderbot).\n\nThe plot is an exploration of a planet gone wrong, with quite some tropes (think of Data from Star Trek Next Generation foremost) but also subversions of what you learn to expect from standard sci-fi.\nI had a lot of fun following Murderbot on adventure, for instance the following observation: I am always supposed to speak respectfully to clients even when they accidentally are to commit suicide or Murderbot plus actual humans equal akward and not to forget: Also, I don’t care & And blablabla\n\nThe novella is super filmic and high on action, but still it will be hard to convey the sass of Murderbot in a compelling manner, and Scarlet Johansson will probably never say: To kill the shit out of it.\nShow more\n78 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"

    "text": "manju ♡\n235 reviews\n2,242 followers\nFollow\nJune 7, 2025\n3.5 !!!\n\ni’ve taken a liking to sci fi books recently and this captivating lil novella has only made me more excited to explore the genre. i absolutely adore murderbot, and i think it’s a testament to martha wells’s writing that she can make a character feel robotic and human, indifferent and empathetic—shifting fluidly as the situation warrants—all at once and with apparent ease. not to compare or anything (i’m definitely comparing), but i read annie bot earlier this year and though the narrator is also a robot with her own consciousness, she feels much less human (even though the book aims to highlight her capacity for emotion and her desire for agency) and is much more forgettable (sorry, annie bot). but all systems red, even in its taut 150 pages, doesn’t fall into that same category. In fact, i think it accomplishes something extraordinary in regard to murderbot’s character. we get important (albeit limited) background info that contextualizes its current rogue state, we see it forced to contend with external threats and internal dilemmas about not liking people but being tasked to protect a small group of them anyway, and the ending gives us insight into its intentions and motivations—all without ever feeling rushed or contrived. again, in only half the length of the average book!! and with a nonhuman protagonist!!! that is a feat indeed. (i do think the conflict resolution happened a bit quickly but murderbot can’t always be narrating like a human, so i’m not going to complain too much about it.)\n\nthat being said, i still feel like i have absolutely no grasp on the world and only a very weak understanding of the sci fi elements. i think the former might be intentional, because i have a million questions and i’m certain that if i went back and reread only like two (if that) could be answered. the latter is more of a me problem because there is sufficient information for readers to keep up, but i just felt like the details got lost on me, and i would sit there wondering what was going on and how exactly the technology worked. hoping the second novella will clear some things up for me but i did really really love this and it makes me sad to give it less than 4 stars so take this as a very affectionate 3.5 🥹\nShow more\n77 likes\n29 comments\nLike\nComment"

But despite Murderbot's name for itself, it's actually a rather hilarious & relatable individual.\n\nBeing deeply invested in downloaded media & characterized by it's inability to interact with humans without being awkward, I feel as though Murderbot will connect with many readers on a personal level.\n\nThe short arc of this story is entertaining to say the least & even manages to pack in some heavy themes about autonomy & friendship (HELLO THIS IS WHAT I WANTED BUT DID NOT GET FROM AUTONOMOUS!)\n\nIt really appeals to my desire for Science Fiction that doesn't require hundreds of pages & convoluted paragraphs to make its point. I'll definitely be continuing on, as I'm intrigued to see what more is in store for Murderbot!\nShow more\n4-star\n \nyear-2018\n75 likes\n15 comments\nLike\nComment"

Check it out - The Brothers Gwynne\n\n“You may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.”\n\nAll Systems is the first novella in the recent huge success that is The Murderbot Diaries. This is a science fiction story that follows the perspective of Murderbot, built to be an emotionless and disciplined killer on command. But the thing with this Murderbot is that he has anxiety, and does not really want to take part in the killing side.\n\n“As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nIt is a great, interesting premise for a story, being quirky and engaging in the way it is told and the themes that it explore. Of course, All Systems Red is a novella, so it cannot explore too much in this first story, but for the page count, I would say that it is successful.\n\nI would say that this is very good at creating a solid cast of characters, with the growth of the crew as well as Murderbot themselves working effectively alongside the plot and the threat that is present in this story. We have two concurrent dangers. If Murderbot is discovered to have this anxiety, they will be altered to be emotionless again, and alongside this the crew they are meant to be guarding and protecting is thrust into danger.\n\nThe characters are quirky, with this novella working well to balance the humour both in the dialogue and the internal monologue of our perspective, and then the tense moments that we experience as well. We get a glimpse into how dangerous Murderbot can be, hence the name, and that adds a level of complexity to this naturally soft yet deadly machine.\n\n“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.”\n\nA novella fans of sci-fi will really enjoy, but one that I believe does not come to fruition unto itself, but one that I hope and believe will become great when read alongside the following stories that Martha Wells has written with Murderbot. Looking forward to continuing!\n\n4/5 STARS\nShow more\naudible\n \nreviewed\n \nsci-fi\n78 likes\nLike\nComment"
