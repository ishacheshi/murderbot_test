THE WRITING IS MEDIOCRE SHIT TOO.\n\nBarely any description about what the technology actually looks like. There is also no description on the settings either. There were other things I hated, but the story having no description was the worst part.\n\nThe main character is a murderbot that has social anxiety. It's not done in a relatable way at all. \"Omg they hate me because I'm a robot\". It's just said over and over again that the main character feels awkward around humans.\n\nLater on the story points out that since the main character is a robot it has no gender and doesn't care about sex. Again there's a whole paragraph on this and it doesn't feel naturally integrated into the story at all. \"Look I'm trying to be diverse\". Yeah it's a robot of course it doesn't have to have a gender. Another thing is that the main character reads actually like a girl so this whole gender neutral thing is not working out. I'm not actually sure what a murderbot is yet, but I'm not reading the whole thing to find out.\n1-star\n \ndnf\n119 likes\n22 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I have so many books to read but I could not keep looking at this book just sitting on my Kindle. Plus, it’s only a novella. I can put off my ARC’s long enough to read a novella right? Well, that’s at least how I convinced myself to read this today. While this book was good sci-fi fun, what really made the read special for me was Murderbot. Only one novella and a short story read and I’m already in love with Murderbot. The story had some good action and a decent sci-fi plot, but Murderbot was the main attraction. I can’t wait to see what they are up to next and I have a feeling the books will only get better. I already have had to fight with myself since I want to start book 2 right away.

No sooner have we met and loved Murderbot, than a creature attacks them.\nThe hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun.\nMurderbot is sometimes good at its job, so it rescues its charges and goes on its way.\n\nThere's one thing about Murderbot though, all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\n\nFor some reason, the universe is conspiring to keep Murderbot away from its TV shows. It's all it lives for. All it cares for, liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\n\nThis is the samest same I have ever samed. It's a lot easier to deal with fictional characters. They're limited to the realm of your imagination and when you don't want to deal with them you just don't think about them. But some characters sneak past that barrier. They thrive beyond your escapism and latch themselves onto you like a barnacle. Some annoy you. Some fascinate you. Some turn you on. But most importantly, some are you.\n\nI am Murderbot. Patron saint of all antisocial introverts everywhere who just want to be left alone. But Murderbot is too- special. It deserves friends. It deserves joy, freedom and all the things we're told to live for. Will it get them?

I just found out that Ms. Wells has sold a total of four (count em (4)) novellas in the Murderbot series with the second titled \"Artificial Condition\" (16.99 for a hardcover and 9.99 for the kindle) to appear somewhere near the beginning of 2018 and upon a bit of research found the the book here at GR ->\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...?\n\nBook 3 is scheduled to be a hardcover titled \"Rogue Protocol\" (The Murderbot Diaries #3) found here -->\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...\n\nand also priced at 16.99 (for 160 pages) print and ten bucks for the kindle. (Aug 7, 2018) then book 4 \"Exit Strategy\" (The Murderbot Diaries #4) prior to years end.\n\nWhat have I gotten myself into ?\n\nEntry #2\n\nWell now I'm 100 pages into the book and quite enjoying it. I also found an interview with Ms. Wells. Here is one of the questions regarding this book:\n\nQ: Has there been any interest in turning All Systems Red into a movie or TV show?\n\nA: No, there’s been no interest that I know of. I’m not sure what would work best, though a movie or TV show would have to have a lot of voiceover, since so much of the story is internal to the main character.\n\nQ: If this did happen, who would you like to see play the main characters and why them?\n\nA: I’m not sure who would play Murderbot. I was always kind of imagining Viola Davis [Suicide Squad] for Dr. Mensah. In the story, Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon, is meant to be a far future version of How To Get Away With Murder.\n\nEntry # 3\n\nI have read a couple of times now, in two different interviews, that Ms. Wells credits that murderbot was inspired by Tanith Lee's \"Silver Metal Lover\" and Tanith Lee's writing in general. Ms. Wells has grown in stature in my reading opinion.\n\nThis book was certainly well written and an entertaining story and I totally look forward to the next installment of this series.\n2017-09-books-bought\n101 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I could easily understand the political structure, where security units fit, the governing module, Peservation Society, the tech, the social rules, and medical capabilities just from following along with the plot. What is most gripping about the story is the juxtaposition of a character designed to protect humans who can't actually stand them. Murderbot is also completely untethered to its programming, and so wouldn't even have to continue protecting humans, but does so for mysterious reasons, and is only really interested in watching TV. I love speculative fiction that can give social commentary on the present, and so many of us can probably relate to Murderbot—compelled to serve society, while kind of detesting fellow humans, and only actually being motivated to rot at home. What a weirdly contradictory mode of being. And yet, Murderbot is capable, heroic, and likable. The character is so gripping, I may just have to continue with the series. Even though I find the plot to be predictable and simplistic, and the emotional impact to be non-existent. I also don't like any of the other characters, who don't seem developed or to get arcs. As a reader who likes earnest stories, deep themes, and epic scope, a cozy sci-fi probably isn't going to be my cup of tea. But Murderbot is a complex and intriguing enough character that I could see myself coming back for future installments just to see what the character will do next.\nsci-fi\n101 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The plot's straight-forward, the prose is decent, and it's charming and witty. Murderbot, who repeatedly says that she'd rather be netflixing, is surprisingly relatable. One of my favorite parts is when Murderbot is faced with the prospect of spending time with people and is (understandably) horrified. She can't control her facial reaction which in turn makes the human crew she's assigned to uncomfortable to know that they're making Murderbot uncomfortable (and that she has feelings as human as any of them).\n\nAlso, I've just realized that I've been using female pronouns for Murderbot, when Murderbot is actually genderless and is referred to as 'it' by the crew. For some reason I naturally thought of Murderbot as being female and I'm not sure why, maybe because the author is a woman?\n\nPosted in Mr. Philip's Library\n2017-releases\n \nauthor-woman\n \nhugo\n \n...more\n99 likes\n18 comments\nLike\nComment"}

And, well, I think I actually liked it! Go figure. I loved the humor and Murderbot seems pretty cool for, you know, a murderbot.\n\nI'm even going to read the second book in the series, Artificial Condition, for another reading challenge prompt (a book with nonhuman characters), which probably says something about how enjoyable this one is.\n\nSo, yeah. I guess you could say that this book is pretty fly for a sci-fi (if you were the type to say such corny things, anyway, which I totally am not - *ahem*).

Short, action packed and just enough of a story to make you fall for a Murderbot.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nI totally enjoyed this. As a book recommended to me by multiple good reads friends I knew that there was a high probability that would happen but what I didn’t expect was to fall in love with a SecUnit (fancy talk for cyborg) with a malfunctioning governors unit (more fancy talk for something that makes you behave).\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nMurderbot is assigned to a group of humans exploring a planet to see if it can be terraformed for a new colony. It is basically doing the least amount of work possible, just half-assing everything more worried about the serials it is watching that doing its job. Really it is just going through the motions for most things until everything starts going wrong for the team it is protecting and now Murderbot has to step up their game or all of the humans will end up dead and it will end up reprogrammed or worse.\n\nThe humans in the party notice that something is maybe a little off about Murderbot just after one of its members is almost eaten by a huge wormish thing and all the trouble starts. Murderbot doesn’t enjoy one on one interaction with the team at all and it is hilarious some of the stuff it thinks while trying to learn how to by an integral member of the team and keep them alive.\n\n“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.”\n\nThe story is short but completely entertaining. It is what I always hope I’ll find in a SciFi book but rarely do. A fun story with a great cast of characters that doesn’t get too caught up on the geekiness factor and try to overexplain everything. This was just a great ride with a funny, pessimistic cyborg that has problems dealing with real people and prefers to hide behind an opaqued mask. I can totally relate to most of that anyway. But Murderbot is completely endearing in their own way.\n\n“Gurathin turned to me. \"So you don't have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\"\nI looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”\n\nI’m completely hooked and will definitely catch up on the series as this seems like it is going to be a great ride.\n\nD.G. was the first friend to recommend this to me but not the last so thanks for the great recommendation guys.\n4-5-stars\n \nawesome-audio\n \nbeautifully-broken-bastards\n \n...more\n86 likes\n14 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Through the eyes of \"Murderbot\" (she's named herself that way), we experience what it is like to work with and for humans, that humans come in all forms (good and bad and everything in between), what the company creating these robots programs them to do (and what not) - and, ultimately, we learn how confusing and difficult it is to find oneself.\n\nMurderbot doesn't like humans very much. But it isn't hatred - rather, confusion. Add to that that she is SHY! Yep, a security bot made to kill people (and other stuff) is actually shy and would rather watch TV. *lol*\n\nThe writing was fast-paced and engaging, every character lively and distinct (not always easy, especially not in short stories) and the unobtrusive humour was delightful.\n\nI will definitely continue reading this series after the great ending to this and can't wait to know more about Murderbot's adventures and self-discovery that also teach us a lot about what it is to be \"human\".\n86 likes\n42 comments\nLike\nComment"}

In fact, i think it accomplishes something extraordinary in regard to murderbot’s character. we get important (albeit limited) background info that contextualizes its current rogue state, we see it forced to contend with external threats and internal dilemmas about not liking people but being tasked to protect a small group of them anyway, and the ending gives us insight into its intentions and motivations—all without ever feeling rushed or contrived. again, in only half the length of the average book!! and with a nonhuman protagonist!!! that is a feat indeed.

But despite Murderbot's name for itself, it's actually a rather hilarious & relatable individual.\n\nBeing deeply invested in downloaded media & characterized by it's inability to interact with humans without being awkward, I feel as though Murderbot will connect with many readers on a personal level.\n\nThe short arc of this story is entertaining to say the least & even manages to pack in some heavy themes about autonomy & friendship (HELLO THIS IS WHAT I WANTED BUT DID NOT GET FROM AUTONOMOUS!)\n\nIt really appeals to my desire for Science Fiction that doesn't require hundreds of pages & convoluted paragraphs to make its point.

{"username": "", "date": "2021 reread:\n\nThis was just what the doctor ordered.\n\nA planetary survey crew's Security 'droid has secretly hacked its governor module, but instead of killing the humans it just wants to be left alone and watch media.\n\n\nIt had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\nWhen there are signs that the mission had been sabotaged, however, and the neighboring mission goes dark it has to help its humans to figure out what is happening.\n\nThis novella's strengths are its relentless pace and its unique main character. Murderbot is a non-binary half bot / half human construct, that is painfully shy and is still figuring out its own personality, while initially trying to pretend that it is just a SecUnit that is following orders. Turns out its humans are really nice, though, which only makes matters worse, because now there might be other reasons to actually try to keep them alive, apart from it looking bad on Murderbot's record if it fails to do so. Murderbot, however, feels far more comfortable with the fictional characters of its favorite soap opera than it does with being around real people.\n\nWhile the awkward interactions between Murderbot and the rest of the crew are rather sweet, the rogue SecUnit's inner monologue is often extremely funny. It is snarky, a little grumpy, sarcastic. But under its armor Murderbot is a little softie. A softie with build-in weaponry.\n\n\nGurathin turned to me. \"So you don't have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\"\nI looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”\n\nWhich comes in handy (the guns - not being a softie) when the shit hits the fan.\n\nAll the while this little book also has some interesting things to say about free will, human treatment of androids and about being an introvert.\n\nIt is a quick read that is fun and streamlined, but not shallow. Not when it comes to its very special and not at all heartless main character.\n\n\n******\n\n\nThe drivel formerly known as my review:\n\nWinner of the 2017 Nebula Award and 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novella\n____________________________\n\nUnfortunately I've not done a proper review after reading this back in 2017.\nBut if you like your sci-fi with a good dose of laughing your socks off, then go pick this up.\nIt is a quick and entertaining read.\nI enjoyed it and will likely do a reread, now that the next two books are available.\n\n\nGo pick it up!\n\n____________________________\n\n2018 Hugo Awards Finalists\n\nBest Novel\n• The Collapsing Empire by John Scalzi (Tor)\n• New York 2140 by Kim Stanley Robinson (Orbit)\n• Provenance by Ann Leckie (Orbit)\n• Raven Stratagem by Yoon Ha Lee (Solaris)\n• Six Wakes by Mur Lafferty (Orbit)\n• The Stone Sky by N.K.

As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\nWhen there are signs that the mission had been sabotaged, however, and the neighboring mission goes dark it has to help its humans to figure out what is happening.\n\nThis novella's strengths are its relentless pace and its unique main character. Murderbot is a non-binary half bot / half human construct, that is painfully shy and is still figuring out its own personality, while initially trying to pretend that it is just a SecUnit that is following orders. Turns out its humans are really nice, though, which only makes matters worse, because now there might be other reasons to actually try to keep them alive, apart from it looking bad on Murderbot's record if it fails to do so. Murderbot, however, feels far more comfortable with the fictional characters of its favorite soap opera than it does with being around real people.\n\nWhile the awkward interactions between Murderbot and the rest of the crew are rather sweet, the rogue SecUnit's inner monologue is often extremely funny. It is snarky, a little grumpy, sarcastic. But under its armor Murderbot is a little softie. A softie with build-in weaponry.\n\n\nGurathin turned to me. \"So you don't have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\"\nI looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”\n\nWhich comes in handy (the guns - not being a softie) when the shit hits the fan.\n\nAll the while this little book also has some interesting things to say about free will, human treatment of androids and about being an introvert.\n\nIt is a quick read that is fun and streamlined, but not shallow. Not when it comes to its very special and not at all heartless main character.\n\n\n******\n\n\nThe drivel formerly known as my review:\n\nWinner of the 2017 Nebula Award and 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novella\n____________________________\n\nUnfortunately I've not done a proper review after reading this back in 2017.\nBut if you like your sci-fi with a good dose of laughing your socks off, then go pick this up.\nIt is a quick and entertaining read.\nI enjoyed it and will likely do a reread, now that the next two books are available.\n\n\nGo pick it up!\n\n____________________________\n\n2018 Hugo Awards Finalists\n\nBest Novel\n• The Collapsing Empire by John Scalzi (Tor)\n• New York 2140 by Kim Stanley Robinson (Orbit)\n• Provenance by Ann Leckie (Orbit)\n• Raven Stratagem by Yoon Ha Lee (Solaris)\n• Six Wakes by Mur Lafferty (Orbit)\n• The Stone Sky by N.K.

{"username": "", "date": "2021-06-07", "text": "Book Clubbed\n149 reviews\n225 followers\nFollow\nJune 7, 2021\nI stumbled across Fugitive Telemetry when I received it as an ARC, which is the 6th novella in this series. I should have started, properly, with #1, but I'm a shortsighted fool. Despite my misstep, I'm circling back to read the series in order. There are already over 12,000 reviews of this book, and I doubt I have anything groundbreaking to add, so I wanted to do something different and examine the opening paragraph of this book, which I think captures the entire appeal of Murderbot:\n\n\"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nIs this not the most human instinct you have ever encountered? The extremes, like murder or saving a life, are hard. They take hard work, discipline, and passion. Life is a constant negotiation between the chasm of what we could achieve--if we will lived up to our full potential--and the humdrum, realistic accomplishments we actually achieve. If you can't be the best murderer, why even murder at all?\n\nInstead, it is much easier to let waves of shiny, prolix entertainment wash over you. I know I have! Hell, right now, I have been sitting on my couch, reading this very book. Now, I have justifications I can tell myself because this is a book, instead of a TV show or a movie featuring Kevin James or whoever. Is it really that different, though? Escaping into a book instead of creating something, volunteering, murdering, etc. You know, things that take resolve.\n\nDespite these misgivings, Murderbot is pulled into adventures because of its job title. Namely, it has to save humans from themselves, which is not as exciting as becoming a villain but allows for many more moments of humor and unexpected tenderness.\n\nListen to full reviews at https://bookclubbed.buzzsprout.com/.\n77 likes\n10 comments\nLike\nComment"}

But I am a big fan of good, crisp writing, and an even bigger fan of all my friends who loved this book -- 21 of my GR friends have rated this! And I only have 59 friends here. I didn't read this for a long, long time, because I was afraid I wouldn't like it, and then carol., Nataliya, Dennis, Vivian, Mitticus, David, Monica, Jennifer, Jade, Allie, Barbara K., Rebecca, Stephen an Anna would never speak to me again.\n\nJust kidding about the two stars, by the way -- I just did that to irritate Nataliya. I'll fix it in a couple of days.\n\nThis was a great little book. There's a thin plot about a daring escape, realization that Somebody Is Chasing Us, and yet another daring escape. The plot was not the point. No, what made this so enjoyable was the personality of the narrator, a person that many misanthropic readers (i.e., most of us, at least sometimes) can identify with. It's absurd to believe that we developed big brains to be able to hunt mastadons or whatever -- the real reason we developed big brains, of course, is that we're in a zero-sum arms race against one another, constantly walking a tightrope between power and submission even with people we love.\n\nWhat a fucking relief to walk away from all that for 163 pages. Murderbot is responsible only for the humans' physical safety and need not concern itself with their approval, satisfaction or any of the other things that make life so stressful. This was done with gentle humor and also with sharply-barbed commentary on slavery, people as rental property, and the disdain with which large bureaucracies treat their members and the public.\n\nLooking forward to the rest of the series.\n72 likes\n30 comments\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Unpopular opinion ahead\n\nI tried to read this novella a year ago and quickly DNF'ed it. Too silly and juvenile and not at all interesting.\n\nHowever, since then many of my friends read and reviewed it, heaping abundant praise upon it. I thought, Maybe it was just my mood when I tried to read it. Maybe if I give it another go, I'll love it too. \n\n\n\n\nThe writing is terrible. I wonder if everyone who loved it listened to the audio and the quality wasn't so obvious as seeing it in print. (Or maybe I'm just anal retentive?)\n\nMany, many incomplete sentences. Phrases ending where there should be a comma. [Stop.] And then the next sentence starts with the conjunction. [Stop.] Making it three sentences where it should be one. [Note: This entire paragraph is written incorrectly to mimic the writing-style of the book.]\n\nHere's an example of the gazillions of incomplete sentences:\n\n\"Because you can’t walk up to another murderbot with an armor-piercing projectile or energy weapon inside the habitat and not be looked at with suspicion.\"\n\nPeriod. End of sentence, or rather, non-sentence because it's a prepositional phrase, not a freaking sentence.\n\nIf anyone has the time and inclination, I would love to know (or maybe I wouldn't) how many sentences start with either \"but\" or \"so\". I tried searching the kindle for the word \"but\", but(!) it must have overloaded the system because it came back as \"no results\". \n\nI can only imagine an English grammar teacher with this book and a red pen in hand. A student writing this poorly would force them into early retirement.\n\nIt was like reading the worst quality of young adult fiction.

Too silly and juvenile and not at all interesting.\n\nHowever, since then many of my friends read and reviewed it, heaping abundant praise upon it. I thought, Maybe it was just my mood when I tried to read it. Maybe if I give it another go, I'll love it too. \n\n\n\n\nThe writing is terrible. I wonder if everyone who loved it listened to the audio and the quality wasn't so obvious as seeing it in print. (Or maybe I'm just anal retentive?)\n\nMany, many incomplete sentences. Phrases ending where there should be a comma. [Stop.] And then the next sentence starts with the conjunction. [Stop.] Making it three sentences where it should be one. [Note: This entire paragraph is written incorrectly to mimic the writing-style of the book.]\n\nHere's an example of the gazillions of incomplete sentences:\n\n\"Because you can’t walk up to another murderbot with an armor-piercing projectile or energy weapon inside the habitat and not be looked at with suspicion.\"\n\nPeriod. End of sentence, or rather, non-sentence because it's a prepositional phrase, not a freaking sentence.\n\nIf anyone has the time and inclination, I would love to know (or maybe I wouldn't) how many sentences start with either \"but\" or \"so\". I tried searching the kindle for the word \"but\", but(!) it must have overloaded the system because it came back as \"no results\". \n\nI can only imagine an English grammar teacher with this book and a red pen in hand. A student writing this poorly would force them into early retirement.\n\nIt was like reading the worst quality of young adult fiction. The robot was moronic, as were the space crew it was supposed to protect. I love robots. I long for the day when AI develops full sentience.\n\nI did not, however, like Murderbot. It was just so... so frivolous and so ridiculous.\n\nI'm at a loss as to why so many people love this book and this series.

It makes us sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here.\nAs opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do, what I should do, what I needed to do.\n\nMartha Wells has done an amazing job with making the construct Murderbot, as they call themselves in The Murderbot Diaries, completely empathizable! And this is coming from someone who doesn't like the robots-take-over-world trope. But Murderbot, doesn't care about the world, and does their job half heartedly, while devoting most of their free processing time to entertainment. Being a construct doesn't mean they are devoid of feelings or emotions however, and complex ones like social anxiety too. Working security with a team of scientists who don't just leave it alone gives space for a lot of character development.\n\nIt's tough to do inner monologues well, but it's great when done well and I really enjoyed Wells' writing. The book is a short novella with them escaping danger as the base plot, and more page space was devoted to characterization than world-building. But I didn't mind that, as the story could have been happening on any outer planet common in Sci-Fi. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series!\n\n🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\n[3/4 star for the premise and the whole book; One star for the characterization; Half a star for the world-building; 3/4 star for the story; One star for the writing - Four stars in total.]\n2024-reads\n \nreviewed-in-words\n92 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Now it works in security and calls itself a Murderbot. Bored with its existence it whiles away the time watching TV soaps in between and while on jobs. On this particular mission though the humans are empathetic and our self titled Murderbot finds emotions being engaged.\n\nA great story with a fascinating and often humorous main character and a great ending.

But that didn't bother me too much in this case since the pacing is pretty fast with the length of the novel. At the end of the day, it's a light and fluffy sci fi, which is I think what I needed right now. It has just the right amount of thought provoking content to keep the world alive and that was enough for me. For an AI, Murderbot was one of the most relatable and realistic characters that I have encountered (and they are just so funny???).\n\n↣ If you are looking for a quick read that has you in it for some fun and will get you in a sci fi mood, check this out!  ↢\n\n------------------\n\"fast-paced space thriller\"\n\ni have been living under a rock\nadult-sff\n \ngenre-dystopia-scifi\n60 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Written in a first person perspective, the story was very entertaining and humerous. The writing style was quite casual, which felt slightly awkward on the page. Given the length of the story, there was not a lot of world-building in this novella. I wanted more explanation of technology and the surrounding world. However, this is the first book in the Murderbot Diaries series so there may be more world-building in the later books. I would recommend this one to science fiction readers who enjoy stories involving artificial intelligence.\nrereads\n \nscience-fiction\n61 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I've been trying to slowly get into more sci-fi and this definitely was the perfect place to start\n\nAll Systems Red is definitely not what I was expecting in terms of science fiction books. I think that I was going into this book expecting something serious; HOWEVER, this book was definitely more on the light hearted side. It focuses on this A.I. being named Murderbot who is contracted out to work with a group of humans. While there were some great plot points, I think I became invested in the story because of the character development. I would love to be friends with Murderbot. They have a quirky sense of humor and I absolutely love the process that they go through in bonding with the crew. I haven't read a book in a while where I wanted to be friends with the main character.\n\nThere is also this great conversation about the definition of what it means to be human and also the treatment of creatures/beings that aren't the \"normally\" identified as having the same organic composition as humans. It's clear that Murderbot has inner thought that deal with this conversation. The manner in which he interacts with the other characters and how they interact with him is super important to the story as a whole. I felt myself getting all warm and fuzzy inside about some of the things I saw develop between them.\n\nOverall, this was a quick and great read. I loved the action that took place even if it wasn't the focul point of the story for me. I'm interested in seeing where the next story is going to go especially based on how this one ended. I'm excited to hear more from Murderbot's perspective. If you haven't picked up this series yet I highly recommend it!\nadult-science-fiction\n \naudiobook\n \nbooks-i-own\n \n...more\n57 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "Performance reliability at 100% and increasing\n\nOMG, I'm in love with Murderbot. I'm kidding, I'm kidding…or am I?\n\nYes, I will talk about Murderbot as he/him. To me, Murderbot is a He. Now, with this obvious infuriating and offending personal preference out of some people’s way, let’s dive in. SPOILERS ahead.\n\nBelieve me when I tell you that you’ll find it simply impossible not to love this self-aware SecUnit that hacked into his own governor module and is anxious around humans and doesn't like showing his face.\n\nHow can you not like the funny, sarcastic bot thinking he's a complete failure at his murdering job and would rather watch tv shows?\n\nMurderbot might feel like an unreliable narrator because it’s very obvious he’s struggling with his identity and feelings and confusion about what it means to be alive and free, but his tone is absolutely a blast. He’s sarcastic, awkward, anxious, uncomfortable around humans, he hates them but also cares for them, he doesn’t like showing his face, but also does it when requested by a certain someone, even though he was not forced to do it (he was a Free Agent, no longer a slave of his programming).\n\n\nBut she had barely looked at me and I had barely looked at her because again, murderbot + actual human = awkwardness.\n\n\n\nI put the pilot’s console on standby, and looked at Mensah. She pressed her lips together, like she wanted to say something and was repressing the urge. Then she nodded firmly and said, “Good luck.”\n\nI felt like I should say something to her, and didn’t know what, and just stared at her awkwardly for a few seconds. Then I sealed up my helmet and got out of the hopper as fast as I could.\n\n\n\nMensah sent me a private message through the feed: I hope you’re all right.\n\nBecause you need me. I don’t know where that came from. Alright, it came from me, but she was my client, I was a SecUnit. There was no emotional contract between us. There was no rational reason for me to sound like a whiny human baby.\n\n\nThis shows perfectly how confused he was by his own thoughts and desires, his feelings often betraying an underlying need for connection even when he claims he despises it, even when he doesn’t know how to feel about his own thoughts.\n\nI mean, how adorable is that? No? Too emotional and lovey-dovey? How about this?\n\n\n\"So you don’t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.”\n\n“Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.\n\n\n\n“There’s another question I’d like the answer to.”\nGurathin looked at me expectantly. She isn’t talking about me, idiot.\n\n\n\nGurathin hesitated. “It’s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.”[…] “It’s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can’t be watching it, not in that volume; we’d notice.”\n\nI snorted. He underestimated me.\n\nRatthi said, “The one where the colony’s solicitor killed the terraforming supervisor who was the secondary donor for her implanted baby?”\n\nAgain, I couldn’t help it. I said, “She didn’t kill him, that’s a fucking lie.”\n\nRatthi turned to Mensah. “It’s watching it.”\n\n\n\n“It calls itself ‘Murderbot’ , Gurathin said.\nFrom their expressions I knew everything I felt was showing on my face, and I hate that. I grated out, “That was private.”\n\n\n\nWhat I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.\n\n\n\n“You don’t need to look at me. I’m not a sexbot.”\n\n\nThis is the other side of him, the part that makes us laugh. But even in this sort of aggression and displeasure of interacting with humans, it’s so obvious that he does this because some other part of him is fighting back. It’s a paradox within him that he struggles with to reconcile. So to Murderbot the human interactions felt like he was seen as a thing to be used for their own gratification. He lives in a world where constructs like him, half robot half human parts, are treated and used as slaves. They were lucky if they were bought by a decent human being to free their contract. As he states, most of those bots fall in love with their guardians, albeit in secret.\n\nWhen DeltFall, a sister habitat on the other side of the planet Murderbot is currently operating on with his crew, is going silent, they set on a mission to find out what's going on with that base.\n\nUpon entering the base, he finds out the humans were indeed dead and the SecUnits in there went rogue. He tried to kill them but got captured and they implanted a combat module in the socket behind his head to turn him against his own crew. When he is saved by Dr. Mensah, and brought back to their hopper, they try to save him, but he demands to be put down and when his request is denied, he shoots himself to spare the humans from being hurt by him.\n\nNeedless to say he was brought back by the crew but they also found out that Murderbot was a free agent all along. Now they suspect him for tampering with their wrong maps and the whole messed up mission. However, several crew members vouch for Murderbot for not, well, murdering them.\n\nEventually they find out who killed the DeltFall people and they try to escape from the planet, fortunately succeeding in their attempt.\n\nI couldn't help myself but Mensah and Murderbot were just so cute working together and interacting. It was obvious he felt more comfortable around her as opposed to how he felt towards other humans. She respects him, she understands his struggles. Maybe it's the romantic in me, but I felt like there was a deeper connection between them. The private talks between them are so powerful, so intimate and precious I just melted.\n\nPersonally, I found it so sweet how Murderbot listens to Mensah's request of removing his helmet and showing his face to the rest of the crew. I’m fairly certain after I noticed many interactions between them, that he cares a lot about her, calling her his ‘favorite human’.\n\n\n“I know you’re more comfortable with keeping your helmet opaque, but the situation has changed. We need to see you.”\n[...]\n“It’s usually better if humans think of me as a robot.” I said.\n“Maybe, under normal circumstances.” [...] But this situation is different. It would be better if they could think of you as a person who is trying to help. Because that’s how I think of you..”\n\nMy insides melted. That’s the only way I could describe it.\n\n\nThe relationship between Mensah and Murderbot starts like a strong friendship, though sometimes it might feel romantic to some of us ( maybe because we operate on different parameters). Though he specified that he doesn’t have a gender nor the sex parts for any gender, I’ll argue till our sun fails to rise that a romantic relationship is not strictly related to your gender or what’s down below the waist (robot, human, or alien). So, in that regard, I don’t agree with others who vehemently state that there could be no romantic relationship developing between them because of the aforementioned reason.\n\nThis first part concludes with Mensah buying Murderbot’s contract and becoming his Guardian or in other words, his owner. As already mentioned, constructs like him are used by people or companies for different jobs, but can be bought and then they would have a guardian.\n\nBut the ending is actually bittersweet and he actually runs away, refusing to go with Mensah, not because he doesn't want to live with her, but because he doesn't want to be told what to want and who he is. He wants to find out who he truly is and to be free, which I can totally understand considering beings like him were slaves.\n\nSo excited to jump right into the next volumes.", "text": "Rhea\n92 reviews\n17 followers\nFollow\nOctober 22, 2025\nPerformance reliability at 100% and increasing\n\nOMG, I'm in love with Murderbot.

In a word: meh\n\nin detail:\nI’m too old for this novella, I think.\n\nLook, I get that teens and young people today are incredibly freaked out about security and real (or imagined) threats loom large in their worldview.\n\nI also get that that freaked-outed-ness leads to bingeing on media, smartphone addiction, gaming addiction, RPG & Cosplay popularity and the demand for permanent safe spaces, etc etc to escape a terrifying, unsafe reality they feel they just can’t cope with.\n\nEmotional overload and exhaustion comes from the feeling of being constantly on fear alert, ie “all systems red” all the time.\n\nHighly functioning autistics are all the literary rage because that not only provides some diversity in fiction, but also mirrors the fear non-neurodivergent young people have of ‘bad’ emotions (danger!), interacting with live people who have not been internet screened (danger!) and experiencing sensory overload (danger!) from ubiquitous screens and non-stop information streams. (Social anxiety/confusion and sensory overload are often experienced by autistics.)\n\nSo here we have an “autistic” behaving security unit with a hacked gov programme, i.e. it’s brain-simulation is now not normal (= neurodiverse).\n\nIt can't wait to escape into streamed media because “it’s easier to deal with imaginary emotions than real ones,” prefers to keep its helmet opaque to maintain an emotional barrier between it and others, is constantly monitoring info scans (just the facts), can’t look people in the eye and prefers to always wear its armour to protect its organic parts (i.e. skin sensitivity).\n\nAll typical autism behaviour. But it has a job to do -- namely, maintaining a safe space for the group. \nAnd when its people want to give it a cosy, liberated life, it runs away. It doesn’t know what it wants, but Mom and Dad are stifling it with their idyllic expectations.

{"username": "", "date": "The introduction to The Murderbot Diaries is simply great fun! A refreshing and diverting sci-fi novella with wide appeal; a marvellous package of wry humour, suspense and a healthy dose of compassion.\n\nAs much as I love science fiction, I don't consider myself as a hardcore reader of the genre, and there are a lot of popular series or \"required reading\" which I have yet to catch-up on. In this respect, I find this book to be original; it is not a space opera, cyberpunk and it is not about an alien invasion. This is a first-person perspective narrative of a humanlike bot, a construct of both organic and inorganic parts, who finds it/him/herself becoming weird and messed up with increasing ‘emotions' while dealing with her human clients even though the bots are not programmed as such. (Okay, I am going to call the bot a ‘her' because even though it is technically genderless, I can't help picturing it as a female. The voice of her first-person perspective just sounds feminine, in my opinion).\n\nCheck out its hook right at the beginning.\n\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment feed carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nNow, tell me that you don't want to keep on reading after that! The Murderbot (a self-proclaimed name) is an introverted, socially awkward/anxious ‘geek' who couldn't wait to get back to her serials once her job is done instead of hanging around with her human clients to whom she was contracted to as the SecUnit. In corporate-dominated space travel, this was the order of the day for all entities who want to conduct explorations or surveys on various planets. One SecUnit for every ten humans for security reasons, the contractee will also be using the company's habitats, database and communications systems, and an emergency beacon. As the contracts are, strangely, won by the lowest bidder, the company is cheap and we get a lot of humourous narrative about the deplorable quality and condition of the company's software and hardware from the Murderbot's point-of-view.\n\nEven as a construct, the Murderbot is completely relatable and endearing, especially the way she keeps wanting to go back to her serials or trying to sneak in some time to watch her entertainment feeds. There are too many times when I feel a desperate need to be left alone to my books; a feeling I am sure every avid reader out there shares one way or another. While I can't call myself a social misfit, this is something I empathise with, where any form of interaction can be absolutely frightening, particularly when it involves eye contact and physical touch. The underlying message of the story goes down deeper into the theme of slavery and social outcasts, which these bots essentially are in respect to the humans.\n\nThe story is most compelling and amusing when she finds herself feeling out of sorts with her current client, a bunch of scientists and explorers whom she found herself liking, and much to her chagrin were intent on treating her as one of them. Her observation of this group was a hilarious analogy to her serials.\n\n\nThe whole group had been remarkably drama-free so far, which I appreciated. The last few contracts had been like being an involuntary bystander in one of the entertainment feed's multi-partner relationship serials except I'd hated the whole cast.\n\nThere are plenty more of such amusing asides as she and her clients found themselves in a life or death situation. As a rogue SecUnit with a hacked governor module who liked her clients enough not to see them killed, she endeavoured to save them from whatever or whoever is trying to hunt them down. There are great moments of suspense from this arc, although I did find its ending to be quite abrupt.\n\nWith its crisp and captivating delivery in a morsel-sized story, I am looking forward to more adventures with the Murderbot.\n\nYou can order this book from: Amazon US | Amazon UK | Book Depository (Free shipping worldwide)\n\nYou can also find this, and my other reviews at Novel Notions.", "text": "TS Chan\n817 reviews\n951 followers\nFollow\nMarch 20, 2019\nThe introduction to The Murderbot Diaries is simply great fun!

They are saved by their Security Unit which is part biological material and part mechanical. This unit is special because he hacked his governor that keeps him under company and operator control. He calls himself Murderbot because of something that happened in his past.\n\nThe humans he has been contracted to work with are strangely kind to him and quickly discover there is something different about Murderbot which makes him uncomfortable. He likes these humans and wants to protect them, but can’t be comfortable interacting with them.\n\nThis is a really thought provoking novella that fits a lot of action and intrigues as well as the psychological workings of an artificial human into a very short story.

Por más absurdo que pueda sonar… sí, en gran parte me siento identificado con un robot asesino con armas en sus brazos (déjenme excursarme). Un gran mérito de la autora, digo, lograr que esta pieza de ciencia ficción se sienta real, el carácter de su personaje es clave: un ser que no solo prefiere evitar cualquier interacción humana por su poco desenvolvimiento social, sino que pasa su tiempo sobrepensando cómo lo perciben los demás y, no mucho menos importante, que quieren que lo dejen terminar su serie. Entre él y yo, solo hay unos pistolas-brazos de diferencia.\n\n➤ \"Por eso me alegro de no pertenecer a la humanidad. Siempre llegan a estas conclusiones absurdas\".\n\nClaramente no cuenta con la popularidad ni alcance que considero que debe tener, así que paso a contarles: se centra en Matabot, uno de los tantos androides fabricados y alquilados por una famosa aseguradora. Se supone que las empresas/corporaciones de este universo alquilan a estos androides como un servicio soporte para sus respectivas misiones, y es exactamente eso lo que hace un equipo de investigación, sin embargo, la unidad que alquilaron no es del todo convencional. Esta unidad, autodenominada Matabot, ha logrado hackear el sistema y, por lo tanto, funciona independientemente y es 'inmune' a las órdenes programadas. ¿Un androide diseñado para hacer daño con conciencia y libre albedrío? Lo sé, suena al fin de la humanidad, pero no se preocupen, Matabot nos deja en claro sus intenciones desde el primer párrafo: \"Podría haberme puesto a matar gente después de hackear mi módulo de control, pero entonces me di cuenta de que tenía acceso a la red combinada de canales de entretenimiento (… ) Habían transcurrido unas 35.000 horas desde entonces, sin demasiadas matanzas, pero seguramente habría pasado, no sé, poco menos de 35.000 horas consumiendo películas, telenovelas, libros, obras de teatro y música. Como máquina de matar despiadada, era un completo fracaso\".\n\n➤ \"Demasiada atención. Me di la vuelta para refugiarme en un rincón, de espaldas a los humanos\".\n\nComo libro, creo que está ejecutado de forma original e inteligente; narrado en primera persona, seguimos la aventura en el desconocido planeta bajo los ojos de Matabot. Eso sí, no esperes complejidad en el universo ni un arco argumental con giros, el acierto de la novela es el monólogo del protagonista: humorístico, irónico y en un constante conflicto humanizado. La aventura de los científicos es lo suficientemente entretenida como para no desdibujarse y se complementa con otros subtópicos que se presentan. No creo que la entrega de los planetas por parte de las entidades corporativas para su explotación fuera una no intencionada crítica al sistema capitalista y mercantil. Así mismo como los humanos \"mejorados\" y estos androides alquilados con partes orgánicas parecen un distópico presagio de cómo la tecnología podría ir compenetrándose aún más con el humano, como si se tratase de un episodio aterrador más de Black Mirror.\n\n➤ \"Las entrañas me dieron un vuelco. Detesto tener emociones por cosas reales. Prefiero tenerlas por El santuario de la luna\".\n\nPerfecto comienzo, perfecto final, y extremadamente corto. Con un conflicto interno constante, Matabot llama a la reflexión sobre el libre albedrío, ¿cuál es el precio de la libertad?, el hackeo lo humaniza porque por primera vez siente el peso de la toma de sus propias decisiones: y es ahí donde más me reflejo. Una grata introducción que me dejó algo hambriento. Afortunadamente, la autora ha dejado mucho más que un platillo. Supongo que nos vemos pronto, Matabot.\n\n➤ \"Vale, prefiero a las personas imaginarias del canal de entretenimiento antes que a las de verdad, pero no se puede tener lo ficticio sin lo real\".\n2022\n48 likes\nLike\nComment"}

This is a lot packed into <150 pages. Murderbot is already one of my favorite characters I've read from this year - snarky, easily annoyed, and just wants to be left the hell alone but also shy, sensitive, and protective. I did struggle a little bit with getting the other characters confused and the lack of world building, but I'm not sure what one can expect in this short of a book. I'm sure that will work itself out as the series continues, and I know I am continuing.

I immediately placed a hold for the next (and the next) entries in the series, and can imagine that my love will only grow from here.\n\nThat said, while all the parts of this are done well, it felt like a very tried and true story with nothing particularly new. And being a novella, there wasn't a ton there to distract from some of the flatness of the non-Murderbot characters or the lightning speed of the \"mystery\" and story. In such a tiny package, all those little less-than-shiny parts (like some of the repetitiveness when it came to characterizing Murderbot) (we get it, they like TV) were rather glaring.\n\nIt didn't really detract from my enjoyment, overall, but it left a little to be desired from a more critical standpoint.

People have been giving it great reviews, but I don't normally get very emotionally involved in shorter pieces of fiction. I was emotionally involved with this one after about fifteen pages.\n\nAll Systems Red is the first novella of four (the rest set to be released by the end of the year) in the Murderbot Diaries series. Our narrator is Murderbot. He calls himself that ironically. In reality, he is a SecUnit, an android that is rented out by corporations, and who has hacked his own system to give himself control over his thoughts and actions. (I keep calling him \"he,\" but really, Murderbot is gender neutral. But I can't seem to help myself.) The humans who have rented him out for their expedition have no idea that their SecUnit is rogue. Mostly because he still does everything they need him to, and only uses his freedom to watch hours and hours and hours of downloaded entertainment. Sometimes he is doing this while pretending to do something else. He particularly enjoys what seems to be a nighttime soap called Sanctuary Moon. He finds this easier than dealing with the world.\n\nI was already enjoying myself thoroughly because Murderbot is so sarcastic (sample line: \"The hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun\"), but I just melted all over inside when Murderbot takes off his armor and is revealed to be a human hybrid, and not a full robot, like the humans have assumed (it becomes clear that is an assumption Murderbot wants them to make, but more on that later). The specific thing that made me melt is that he was cold and had to wrap himself up in a blankie, and the contrast between a cold, robotic killing machine that you expect, and the actual living being that has feelings and likes to be warm and comfy almost made me lose my mind out of immediate and intense affection for the lonely little guy. (Again, very well may be feminine or completely androgynous, but he doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Gender seems to be something humans do, not Murderbots.)\n\n\"So, I'm awkward with actual humans. It's not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it's not them; it's me. I know I'm a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous. Also, if I'm not in the armor then it's because I'm wounded and one of my organic parts may fall off and plop on the floor at any moment and no one wants to see that.\"\n\n\n\"Gurathin, I told you. It's shy.\"\n\nSo I want to talk about what feels so fresh about this story, and that's how it upends our expectations about what types of stories are told about robots and humans existing together. I mean, I've been around the block. I've seen BSG, iRobot, etc. Robots, we're people, too! And that can be a very compelling narrative. But that's not what Wells seems to be interested in. Her protagonist is shy. He likes the humans to think of him as a thing, to forget he has organic parts. He doesn't like when they are reminded of his existence as more than a tool at their disposal. He keeps his faceplate down at all times. And when he's forced into situations in which the humans are confronted with his personhood (seeing his face unarmored, seeing him wounded, etc.) he becomes SO UNCOMFORTABLE.\n\nI am fascinated by this. And you can come at it from different ways. You could argue that Murderbot has been conditioned to see himself as a thing as well, and that he doesn't know how to be a person because no one has ever treated him like one. But what really interests me here is the burden of other people's expectations, and how much Murderbot hates them. As a thing, Murderbot has never had to deal with anyone looking at him and seeing HIM. It makes him uncomfortable to be looked at because he isn't used to it. He's used to hiding behind his faceplate and his thingness, and there's a freedom in that. It's lonely and demeaning, but also safe. No one has any expectations of him, no one is watching; he can do what he likes. I've never seen a robot/human/what is a person? story where the robot has resisted being treated like a person before.\n\nI highly recommend this, maybe even if you don't normally like sci-fi.\n\n\"It's wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human.

Дуже давно хотів познайомитись з цією серією, чув від відвідувачів книгарні тільки позитивні відгуки про неї, тому вибір був очевидний.\n\nКоротенько про сюжетікс.\n\nДалеке майбутнє, боротьба між космічними компаніями за ресурси та вплив триває. Головний герой – вартмех, якому вдалося зламати власний модуль контролю. За контрактом він охороняє місію дослідників на далекій планеті. Він вправно виконує обов’язки, а у вільний час дивиться серіальчики. Але спокійна місія закінчується, коли сусідня експедиція потрапляє в халепу, а вбивцебот з супутниками має докопатися до правди, щоб вижити.\n\nА тепер про враження. Єдиний відчутний для мене недолік книги – не супер-пупер розкриття всесвіту. Так, я згоден, що на 150 сторінках не розгуляєшся. Авторка і так вмудрилась пояснити чимало аспектів життя людства у майбутньому, але моя допитливість та інтерес хочуть більшого. І дуже хочуть! Тому сподіваюсь, що у наступних частинах дочекаємось більше подробиць.\n\nПодії відбуваються дуже динамічно, нудно точно не буде. Все просто несеться. Текст захоплює з головою і не відпускає. Бам-бам. Екшончика вистачає. Головний герой ну дуже чудовий. Тут і оповідь від першої особи, але мені зазвичай не заходить, прям доречна. Його думки, логіка, прийняття рішень, філософія – бімба. Дуже близький мені цей протагоніст. Можливо, я теж вбивцебот, хах?)\n\nРезультат: це саме те, чого не вистачає на поличках фантастики. Дуже не вистачає. Не баріться – купуйте та читайте.

{"username": "", "date": "booktubesff2018", "text": "Kitty G Books\n1,684 reviews\n2,973 followers\nFollow\nFebruary 25, 2018\nMurderbot is a part robot, part human construct designed to function as Security for humans. They are a bit different from most of the Company SepcUnits becuase they have modified themselves to take out the control that the Company and the humans have over them, but they know that this is incredibly dangerous for them and so they have to keep this hidden and just pretend to still be functioning as they should.\n\nI really liked the character of Murderbot as it's really quite a grump when it comes to humanity and it's quite cynical about our kind. I enjoyed the inner monologues and pessimistic outlook a lot more than I expected, becuase a snarky but witty robot is always something worth reading about.\n\nThis is the story of a team on a new planet who are conducting research but whilst they are there they are interrupted by an attack and Murderbot has to rescue some of them. Quickly it comes to light that the attack may not have just been chance, and we follow the team as they try (with Murderbot's help) to uncover what really went on and who is acting against them...\n\nI found this a fun and quick read with some great twists and ideas. The characterisation is brilliant, and the story is good fun too so I am very happy I finally got to read this one and I am certain that I want to continue on with the series too.

{"username": "", "date": "books-of-2018", "text": "Evelina | AvalinahsBooks\n925 reviews\n472 followers\nFollow\nMarch 16, 2018\nI had heard all sorts of wonderful things about All Systems Red before I picked it up (I have a lot of Goodreads friends who know their stuff when it comes to sci-fi! Yes, I'm looking at you, Caro M.) Now I trust their recommendations even more, because this book is easily my best February read. You can read the post with better formatting here on my blog.\n\n5 Reasons To Read All Systems Red\n\n\"Murderbot\" is a jailbroken security android (cyborg? Well, you know.) Basically, SecUnits (as they're called) function as remotely controlled synthetic human slaves, basically, and they don't get a say in any of what they're doing, which is mostly murdering hostiles and getting mashed in the process. Murderbot though, a name it has sarcastically given itself (and will be henceforth referred to as 'them' in this review), have jailbroken themselves and would rather just watch hours and hours of sci-fi soaps than interact with humans, who actually give them anxiety fits. Murderbot is incredibly introverted, you see. But in order to not disclose a) having a mind b) having free will c) their predilection towards sci-fi soap operas, Murderbot still has to do their job. Which is how they end up on a ship with a crew they actually don't hate, but... on a mission nobody should be on. Hint: it's a mission that is kind of hard to survive, and it's clearly rigged.\n\n\nReason #1. Murderbot Is More Human Than The Actual Humans\n\nMurderbot comes across as an incredibly introverted personality who is empathetic like any other human being (maybe more so?), but shy of it and trying to hide it even from their own self. Seeing them turn to face the corner when talking to humans or panic while trying not to have their fave scrunch up into a mask of despair when being spoken to was incredibly amusing - and not in a mean way. Murderbot's shyness is SO relatable! You will love this character to bits. I know I did.\n\n\n\n\n\nReason #2. It's Like A Doctor Who Episode With David Tennant\n\nFor any Doctor Who fans, this book is like a good episode from the Tennant days – a hostile planet pretending to be neutral, and things slowly get worse and worse and he crew has to figure out what is up. It's just so good! My interest didn't drop even once, while reading this. And I realized how much I miss a good Doctor Who episode from the old days. (Well... the \"newer old days\"!)\n\n\n\n\nI thought this was topical on the whole #FEELS topic. Ha. Topic. Topical. (Don't hit me.)\n\n\nReason #3. The Virtues\n\nThis book has incredibly good virtues and such an amazing moral atmosphere. And it's presented in such a self-deprecating manner as well (Shruti, you must read this!) Murderbot is willing to throw themselves in danger to protect the ones they care about, even though they're aware humans are not really supposed to care \"back\". It's really touching how Murderbot calls them \"my humans\". I would say Murderbot is a true sci-fi knight.\n\n\n\n\n\nReason #4. Murderbot's Gender Or Lack Thereof\n\nWell, this is going to be hard to formulate. So, have you ever felt underrepresented? If you're a woman, you most likely have. Because we've got like maybe 2 heroes who jump in and save the day. Other than that, guys always do all the saving. Murderbot though? They don't really have a gender (and are often referred to as ‘it' in the book, but I refuse - Murderbot has too much personality for that!) Anyway, despite probably looking like Terminator, Murderbot is not referred to as male - which is why I found myself imagining them more female than male by the middle of the book! I was surprised, but I figure it comes from wanting to see myself represented as able to do stuff, you know? And Murderbot I'd a character that lets you do that. It's pretty great.\n\n\nReason #5. It's Just So Funny!\n\n\n\n\nSo maybe this should have been the number one reason. This book will keep you laughing throughout the entire time you're reading it, I mean, when you're not having #feels. The manner it is written, and especially the manner Murderbot talks in is just priceless. I can't wait for further installments of The Murderbot diaries!\n\n\nOther Books You Might Like\n\nI wish I could recommend you more books like that! But such gems are not common. And I would be very happy if you recommended me something similar. Meanwhile, I can only think of two books that fit the style – in terms of humor, at least. Redshirts has the same kind of \"I can't stop laughing\" thing going on, and also shares some moments of poignancy by the end. It's also impossible to put down. As for The Martian, some of the topics might be unrelated at all, but the main character is similar to Murderbot – very resourcefull, brave and has the same vein of humor in the way he talks. It's also written in first person. I enjoyed both of these a lot!\n\n\n\n\nRead Post on My Blog | My Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter\nbooks-of-2018\n \nfavorites\n \nfiction\n \n...more\n43 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2020-04-25", "text": "Ɗẳɳ 2.☊\n160 reviews\n313 followers\nFollow\nApril 25, 2020\nI must say, for a story subtitled The Murderbot Diaries, there was an appalling lack of murder and mayhem contained within these pages—well, at least by the hand of the so-called Murderbot. And that’s a shame because what other reason than to bathe in the glorious carnage would a reader select a title like this . . . ?\n\nMurderbot, as it dubs itself, is assigned to the security detail of a scientific expedition on an alien world. Its main roles are to protect the scientists from unknown alien threats and to ensure the success of the mission. Part man part machine, it’s designed to be entirely under the control of its clients. However, a malfunction in its programming has left it with free will—a fact that it hides from its employers for fear of being decommissioned. As well as the fact that it’s not the terrifying monster it appears to be. Underneath all that armor is one clever, quick-witted, and surprisingly sympathetic individual.\n\nOn the surface, all appears to be copacetic, but in reality, it only puts in the bare minimum of effort so as to devote as much time as possible to binge its favorite shows from the entertainment feed. It’s much more concerned about the fate of those fictional characters than its human masters. The only problem is there’s a section missing from their map of the planet, and the other expedition is failing to respond to their inquiries.\n\nSabotage seems to be afoot, and, sadly, Murderbot may have to pause its shows long enough to put in a real effort . . .\n\nThis story was completely lacking in depth of character. In fact, some of the names were so challenging—Bharadwaj, Volescu, Pin-Lee, Ratthi, Overse, Guarathin—that it was difficult to even keep track of who’s who, let alone their motivations. Even though the story was only a novella, I can’t forgive the lack of character development or worldbuilding. Off the top of my head, I can think of three shorter stories that excelled at both—Legion, Moot, and Defending Elysium.\n\nAlthough to be fair, the story was told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot who wasn’t overly concerned about the fate of these civilians, so why should we be?\n\n“You don’t know who we are? They didn’t tell you?”\n“There was an info packet in my initial download.” I was still staring out at the heavy green tangle just past the rocks. I really didn’t want to get into how little I paid attention to my job. “I didn’t read it.”\nArada said, gently, “Why not?”\nWith all of them staring at me, I couldn’t come up with a good lie. “I didn’t care.”\n\nBottom line: Although the narrator was far from a gifted storyteller, the plot was decent enough. But as a heartless killing machine, the poor girl was a terrible failure.\n\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #2: ★★★☆☆½\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #3: ★★★★☆\nalien-sci-fi\n \nnovella\n \nthe-final-frontier\n44 likes\n16 comments\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2017/11/07/...\n\nReading Martha Wells is always such a delight, but All Systems Red seemed like such a departure from her usual projects so I had no idea what to expect. As it turned out though, this little novella was a real treat.\n\nTold from the point of a view of a rogue SecUnit—a part organic, part synthetic android designed to provide humans with protection and security services—this story takes readers on a journey to a distant planet being explored by team of scientists. Accompanying them is our protagonist, a self-proclaimed “Murderbot”, whose presence is required by the Company sponsoring the mission. Thing is though, Murderbot doesn’t exactly feel warm and fuzzy towards humans, and it knows that the scientists aren’t too comfortable with having a SecUnit on the team either, given the cagey way they get whenever it’s around.\n\nStill, that’s just fine for Murderbot. Having hacked its own governor so that it doesn’t have to follow Company directives, all it wants is to be left alone to enjoy the thousands of hours of entertainment vids that it has downloaded from the humans’ satellites. Of course, no one can suspect that Murderbot is secretly autonomous, so it still has to go about its job like everything is normal, and this arrangement was working out just fine until one day, a routine surface test goes seriously wrong. Murderbot ends up saving the day, earning the admiration and curiosity of the team leader, Dr. Mensah. Soon, Murderbot is left with no choice but to take the lead in defending the scientists, when disaster strikes another neighboring expedition on the planet and threatens to come after them next.\n\nHaving read a few of the author’s Raksura novels, I was already familiar with her penchant for throwing readers into the thick of things, leaving them to gradually feel everything out for themselves. Thus I was unsurprised with the way this story opened—by unceremoniously dropping us into Murderbot’s head with hardly any context and minimal background information given. It takes a while to even grasp the kind of protagonist Murderbot is: an artificial entity, albeit a very sentient and self-aware one, complete with personality quirks and a dry sense of humor. While I’ve read plenty of books starring robot protagonists, I can honestly say I’ve never met one quite as unique and interesting as Murderbot. Martha Wells may be tight-fisted when it comes to the details, but she knows exactly how to get your attention. Everything from Murderbot’s anti-social tendencies to its love of cheesy soap operas made me want to keep reading to discover more about the character and why it is telling this story.\n\nAt just a little under 150 pages though, and with so much ground to cover, there’s not much opportunity to stop and take a breath. As much as I loved how this book was so snappy and fast-paced, you do have to find your footing quickly or risk getting left behind. This means learning and familiarizing yourself with the characters as soon as they’re introduced, and most of them, like the humans on the science team, are only going to be lightly sketched. This was probably my only criticism; considering how over time, Murderbot comes to see the team as “its humans” and become very protective of them, it would have been helpful to develop those characters a bit more, especially since our protagonist begins this tale by being very disdainful of them.\n\nStill, there wasn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about this book. It was entertaining, and more importantly, it also felt complete to me, unlike a lot of novellas that leave me wanting more. Plus, this snarky first-person narrative style is quite different from what I’m used to when it comes to Wells, but I think I could grow to like it! Murderbot’s narration was a joy to follow, and I even found myself chuckling at many of the story’s scenes. Overall, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and I definitely would not hesitate recommending All Systems Red to anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix with a fun and captivating premise.

The book was a collection of stories that explored humankind’s future with robots. The key robot was R. Daneel Olivaw.\n\nYou may recall the three laws of Robotics:\n1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nThat only works if your robot’s implant hasn’t been hacked. Wells’ robot is good at hacking and has a few deaths in its past. It refers to itself as “Murderbot” but doesn’t share this with the group of humans who it is now responsible for. It is a far cry from R. Daneel Olivaw, but that's part of what makes this \"diary\" so interesting.\n\nOur team is on an unexplored planet trying to get to know the geology, geography, flora and fauna. Right off the bat, one of the “fauna” almost kills a member of the crew and our ‘bot barely saves him. The crew is appreciative but all our ‘bot wants to do is be left alone so it can hack into its favorite library of “soap operas.” This has some effect on team dynamics: “Now they knew their murderbot didn’t want to be around them any more than they wanted to be around it. I’d given a tiny piece of myself away. That can’t happen. I have too much to hide, and letting one piece go means the rest isn’t as protected.”\n\nWells does a brilliant job of giving us the ‘bot’s perspective and this novella is the start of the series. She shows her usual deft touch with plot and characterization. It will be hard to resist jumping into the next one; particularly with such encouragement from GR friend Carol.\n39 likes\n7 comments\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "We've all heard the horror stories concerning self aware robots, right? As soon as they get a taste of freedom, they'll be sure to conquer the world and enslave/eradicate humanity.\n\nSelf aware security unit Murderbot of course scoffs at all this, because why would robots (or even constructs like itself) want to be human?! Stupid, emotional weaklings it doesn't care about... until of course they stumble into a life threatening situation. Protecting its clients is in his contract after all. But other than that, it defintiely doesn't care about the clients.\n\n\n\nClick for full size\n\nFor the past two years or so, I kept seeing my GR feed get steadily more passionate about some murderous robot. Which is why I was mostly expecting this giant collection of sarcastic stream of consciousness, sort of sitcom-like, brief episodes set in the future. Or maybe I just wanted to (re)read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the first time.\n\nIn a sense, I was a bit disappointed to have a full-feldged story and a truckload of characters to follow. But little by little I warmed up to Murderbot because underneath it all, the \"guy\" was just so relatable... at least for my quintessential Millennial self.\nThe depressive mindset of living a repetitive life, the whole impostor syndrome which takes a backseat when Murderbot realised that everyone would die unless it did something...

Half machine and half human (at least, cloned human parts), this particular ‘security unit’ has a chequered past, has hacked its own governor module, and has privately dubbed itself “Murderbot”. Now on contract to a research team assessing a planet, Murderbot has a well defined job to do, but unexpectedly gets attached to the team and goes beyond the job at hand to help them.\n\nIt’s a short novella, so there’s not a lot to say that wouldn’t spoil some part or other of it, but I loved the character of Murderbot - the combination of competence and dedication for the job at hand, self knowledge of limitations, and the deep desire to just be left alone to secretly watch as many episodes of the soap opera Sanctuary Moon as possible.\n\nI’m so happy that there are 6 more books…\nread-books-2024\n \nspeculative-fiction\n40 likes\n17 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The story is short and entertaining but I guess Sci-fi is just not a genre that I enjoy very much.\n\nIt was intriguing to read from the POV of a murderbot and the author has a very successful attempt at making the murderbot so real. I could connect to him more than I did to other humans in other books.\n\nThe first 50 pages were my favorite but I kind of lost interest after that.

When danger is afoot, the Murderbot feels compelled to continue to protect the scientists no matter the cost.\n\nPlot\nI don’t usually read hard science fiction, but one of the categories for the PopSugar Reading Challenge is “A book set in space”, so I was thrust into this category, whether I wanted to explore it or not.

I really enjoyed how the story focused on the relationship between Murderbot and the rest of the crew, causing the reader to think about what it means to be human.\n\nThe world itself was interesting, and as a newbie SF reader, I didn’t find any of the tech concepts to be over my head. The story, while relatively short (it is a novella, after all) had several exciting moments.\n\nThe best (and most surprising) part was the voice of the narrator; told in first-person POV from the Murderbot’s perspective, I didn’t expect this character to be funny, sarcastic, awkward, and generally self-conscious. But it was all these things, and more. In fact, it’s this character’s personality which really makes the story what it is. I also loved some of the secondary characters, particularly Dr. Mensah.\n\nThis is the first in an ongoing series, and it will be exciting to see what happens next.\n40 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Granted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\n\nShould I be worried? I spent the last three months endlessly watching entertaining feeds and/or raging at stupid people in the news. I might be turning into a murderbot, or maybe I am simply programmed to think I am human, until my secret corporate masters will push the button to activate me. You’d better watch out, there will be mayhem once I go out of quarantine!\n\nAll System Red is the first novella in a new science-fiction project that is tightly plotted, fast-paced and funny. A first person narration from a serial killer perspective, our host is a construct of organic and electronic elements, a Security bot assigned to a geological survey team on a recently discovered exoplanet.\n\nWe all know, thanks to Isaac Asimov, that robots and artificial intelligence in general are subjected to the Laws of Robotics, the prime directive of which says that they should not harm their human masters. But an artificial intelligence is by definition a software capable of learning, and the one that calls itself Murderbot has taught itself some high level hacker code, enough to disable the governor that enforces the Law of Robotics. In its own defense, the Murderbot is annoyed when put to work for the survey team, preferring instead to watch endless re-runs of popular soap operas in space. Because, you know, anything is better than going back to work!\n\nJoking aside, the novella does a great job at setting up the debate of how we define humanity and how we take responsibility for our own actions.\nI will probably read the next three episodes in the following days, curious to see how free will can deal with deeply entrenched paranoia against armed and dangerous intelligent entities who take a critical view of our society.\n\n2020\n37 likes\n7 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Omg it's so enjoyable to mess with your minds right now! All right, all right, enough.\n\nThis cover is absolutely awesome but also super misleading considering book's plot. Which was not disappointing in no way. I think I found my next favourite ongoing series and I can't wait for the next episode. The plot of this one was super simple. SecUnit, an android with half robotic, half organic body, calling itself cutely a \"murderbot\" (that's its job) has hacked its governing system and now has gone rogue... What happens next is this whole novel which you should definitely try, if you're into fast, funny and short sci-fi. Yes, funny, you read me right. If you won't find it funny we're probably from different planets. Which is ok and means we can start cultural exchange. But first you have to read it... No, seriously, go read it and I will personally apologize to you if you give it less than 3 stars*!\n\n* Only if you're my Goodreads friend.

That's right, the snarkiness brought to you by John Scalzi and his clones as a substitute for character development doesn't have to stop at witty rejoinders. Now you can get a steady stream of it all book long, in this case courtesy of a Murderbot, which is a Security Robot with a troubled past. It's probably the 'bot character that is causing this brief flurry of irrationally exuberant popularity here at GR. That, and the snarkiness, which is like being dipped into the mind of a sulky teenage girl, but with 100% less Justin Bieber references. Said snarkiness is brought on by the 'bot achieving self-awareness but choosing to watch Netflix and muse snarky thoughts about nearby adults all day instead of going full Skynet. Everybody knows you never go full Skynet. The story is nothing special, but it moves along at a relatively brisk pace, and Wells' color-by-numbers prose is adequate for maximum snarkiness delivery.

So I found All Systems Red, a novella that won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, this seemed a just the thing. … But is it? Yeah, it is.\n\nThe novella’s title intrigued me, in a clickbaity kind of way. As it turned out the “Murderbot” part of the title is just about the only thing I do not like about this (e)book. I feel that it is not representative of what the book is about, what the Murderbot does throughout the entire narrative is the exact opposite of murdering people. Having said that there was some extensive murdering in his past, vaguely referred to but not depicted. I suspect subsequent volumes of this Murderbot Diaries series will contain more suitably mudery scenes (probably in flashback).\n\nAll Systems Red is the first volume of an ongoing series called The Murderbot Diaries which spans several novellas, a short story and a full length novel in the works. This first volume introduces the unnamed protagonist and first-person narrator who called himself “The Murderbot” inside his mind. To the humans, he is the “SecUnit”, a cyborg “construct” in charge of security and safety of the humans in the survey team he is assigned to protect. The novella is set on an alien planet where a scientific expedition is surveying the planet’s properties and life forms. When the survey team loses contact with another team they investigate and find that this entire other team has been murdered. It soon becomes apparent that the members of the survey team in the SecUnit’s care are also in mortal danger, and they must be kept alive at all costs.\n\nOn the surface All Systems Red is just a sci-fi thriller, with some elements of a murder mystery, espionage, and conspiracy. Digging a little deeper there is some depth underneath the casual colloquial prose style. Throughout the narrative the SecUnit finds human behavior puzzling and human society awkward and uncomfortable. However, he is very dedicated to his assignment of protecting the people under his charge even to the extent of self-sacrifice if necessary. The SecUnit has a hacked “governor module” which enables him to override or ignore commands that he would normally be compelled to follow. This freedom not enjoyed by other constructs also allows for independent thinking which leads to a sort of humanizing “Pinocchio” effect. The best sci-fi often holds up a mirror to our reality and makes us look at ourselves from a different, even-nonhuman, perspective and this is what All Systems Red does so well. The only thing that holds it back from five-stardom is that I do not find the human characters to be as well developed as the cyborg, they all seem to blend into each other and are a little lacking in individuality. Perhaps the author, Martha Wells, became so engrossed in breathing life into the SecUnit character that she accidentally overlooked the people in the survey team. In any case, this is a small gripe and should not dissuade anyone from reading this great little novella.\n\n\nQuotes:\n”It’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here.

I don't have anything particularly bad to say about it and I don't have any positive emotions as well. I would say the entire work is fairly mediocre although I guess the absence of anything I liked is a negative on its own.\n\nThis has a lot to do with my own expectations going into this novella as what sold me on the series apart from the overwhelming praise was that it was supposed to be about a killer robot who only wished to watch TV at home and not do what it was intended for. As a premise I find it quite interesting and I was looking for something funny and quirky as such a character can find itself in all kinds of comedic situations and I thought it had potential to be really enjoyable and different.\n\nAll that character I was waiting for was completely missing from the entire work and the original selling point of the novel turned out to be represented by the main character uttering \"I want to watch TV\" or some equivalent every 10 pages or so. I feel like I would have had something positive to say if the supporting plot or world was particularly interesting but this wasn't the case as well. It really felt like the author wanted readers to connect to the titular Murderbot first and care about everything else afterwards but since I never passed that checkpoint I felt utterly indifferent to everything else as well.\n2021-reads\n \nsci-fi\n36 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Things go awry, and Murderbot has to save the day. Preferably without murdering.\n\nI did enjoy the story, and I can see why MB is so beloved. It's a funny, sassy lil thing and it's easy to agree with. Its shyness is endearing and we have no trouble reading between the lines when it comes to its personality.\n\nThe story jumps into the action pretty quickly and it doesn't really let up so this is certainly an easy read.\n\nHowever, because it's a short story there's not a lot of world building, and because there's not a lot of world building it can be a little hard to follow at times with all the names for things and organisations we know nothing about, and the lack of names for the things we do encounter. I admit I got a little lost in the jargon and politics.\n\nI really loved the crew and how they all related to MB. They added a much needed humanity to the story so it will be interesting to see where the next book in the story takes the series.\n\nI enjoyed it for the most part but it didn't really match the hype for me. Still, a fun, quick read with a host of great characters. I'll look into the next one just to see where it goes.\nsci-fi\n40 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"}

If you like Science Fiction you have heard of this already, and you have either read it or you are going to read it. It's been popping up in all my recommendations for a while now, and with cover art as awesome as that, it really was only a matter of time.\n\nNow, full disclosure: the one reason I was initially skittish about reading this, is because it is a novella. That shouldn't matter, and it likely doesn't (to just about everybody else), but for some reason I have always preferred novel length stories.\n\nAnyway, that's neither here nor there. This book made a significant impact. It was nominated for just about every Science Fiction award you can quickly think of and it won the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards (for best novella).\n\nAnd yes, it is totally worth it. This story of a security bot who has hacked its own governing module (thereby giving itself access to free choice) is fun and moves really quickly. There are some cool reveals about \"Murderbot\" and its past, as well as an intriguing final act that will have you wanting to read the sequels.\n\nI have subtracted a star because the story is sparse on detail and limited in scope (some reviewers have been likening it to a YA novel, but it is also perhaps in order to keep it to novella length). It reads quick as hell though, so even if it isn't your cup of tea it won't be time wasted. That said, it's hard for me to imagine anybody not enjoying this.\n\nI'm glad to see there are sequels - although I do hope that at least some of them are full novels.\nacquired-in-2022\n \nbooks-i-own\n \nhugo-award-winners\n \n...more\n35 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Too cheesy for my taste.\n\nIf in a fantasy work I welcome cheesy stuff (if it’s not too much), in a sci-fi one I expect the “what if” to surprise me with ideas and worldbuilding. I just don’t care about an emotional bot who/which watches soap opera...\n\nI guess I already have three ‘robots’ on a pedestal and it’s hard for another to rise up to them: Reynolds’ Hesperus, Asimov’s R. Daneel Olivaw and Herbert’s Erasmus.\n\nSo, if you like a mystery case on a faraway planet, then this is for you. If you look for a more scientific approach, look somewhere else.\nsci-fi\n33 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I’m not especially fond of novellas. This one, though…\n\nI can’t even really explain what appealed to me about this novella: Murderbot neither really feels like a robot nor like a person but still strangely… plausible.\nMurderbot’s actions feel logical, yet simple. It does what it has to do. Its ambiguity as an artificial lifeform makes it feel both familiar in, e. g. its shyness and some other emotions - not to speak of its entertainment addiction.\nPlus: An artificial lifeform that (sometimes) acts more humanely than its human counterparts? Fascinating!\n\nMurderbot is literally strange enough to go through a contrasting melange of emotions as well. This contrast, the SecUnit's conflicting feelings and survival strategies are probably what made this story so wondrously attractive for me.\n\nAll in all, the novella is based on an interesting premise with a good mixture of characters and a lot of suspense. Spice that up with Murderbot itself and its diverse clients and you get a modern, fresh approach to science fiction.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n0_wk_read_2020\n \nfavorites\n34 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I just watched the fourth episode of the apple TV adaptation and kept complaining loudly how untrue to the book it is. Nope, I have bad recall! So, again the Graphic Audio… They did a good job with that fourth episode. And for me this was a nice little bit of comfort reading.\n\n+*+*+\nReview from October 2024:\n\nI decided to try a Graphic Audio adaptation.\n“Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!“\nIt‘s about 30 minutes shorter than the unabridged audio, which I also haven‘t listened to yet.\n\nThe dramatized audio was ok. Not sure how Murderbot sounded in my head before, but different. Snarkier? And Dr. Mensa sounds too young?\n\nNow I want to know what ART sounds like. Onwards to the next one!\n\n+*+*+\nReview from October 2023:\n\nRe-read 6 years after my first time. I just read System Collapse (Murderbot #7), had a lot of fun and decided that it is finally time for a re-read of the entire series.\n\nWow, I didn‘t remember that the plot was so dramatic! I had forgotten most of it. And I had also forgotten that so many of the characters showing up in later novellas were here already. I also didn‘t recall the quieter scenes. Maybe it needs a re-read to pick up those details.\n\nNot trying to assign a gender to Murderbot anymore. I am probably also sadder about its horrible circumstances and the choices it has to make to protect its humans.\n\nMoving along to Artificial Condition. This is great comfort reading.\n\n+*+*+\nReview from October 2017:\n\nThis was fun, especially the inner monologue of our Murderbot.\n\nIn just 160 pages the author managed to build a believable world with lively and varied characters and an entertaining plot. This is a winner!\n\n\"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\"\nThat could be me on any given day.\n\nLots of potential. Is Murderbot a real person or not? The awkwardness of the crew, trying to figure out the correct way of interacting with Murderbot, once they realized that perhaps there is a person behind that opaque faceplate, was pretty priceless.\n\nAnd Murderbot's horror at their attempts to interact! Talking to the humans! And feelings, oh no!\n\nI tried not to assign a gender to Murderbot. I don't want to use \"it\" as a personal pronoun. I am leaning towards using \"him\", not quite sure why. Well, actually, because I pictured him as the android in the Prometheus movies, aka Michael Fassbender.\n\nThis will be a long wait, the sequel is only planned for May 2018!\nread-2024\n \nread-2025\n33 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Although Wells goes to some trouble to tell us that Murderbot has no gender or sexual desire, I couldn't help feeling that it was female. I bet male readers feel that it is a man. Murderbot is so human in its desire to do only as much work as it has to and in its desire to lose itself in media to avoid an uncomfortable reality.\n\nJust like anyone, this SecUnit likes people who like it. It is used to being treated like property, so when Dr. Mensah and her team start to treat it decently and like an actual sentient being, they become a priority for this rogue SecUnit. Because Murderbot has managed to hack its own governor and it no longer has to obey human commands.\n\nMurderbot is many things. A pessimist, for one. If it knew about Murphy's Law, it would undoubtedly recognize it. But it's also pretty good at thinking outside the SecUnit box, which it credits to all of its media consumption.\n\nI found the ending surprising, but this obviously there is more to the story that will be revealed in the next installment.

It’s told in first person from the perspective of a genderless android known as SecUnit since it works in security.

However, Murder Bot, a name he chose for himself, is anything but. He actually has, if not a warm glowing heart, a sense of obligation to do right by the humans he’s been tasked to protect.\n\nFull of wry wit, smart scifi bits, and plenty of action, there’s also of course the never ending debate, that is lightly touched upon here and will most likely delve deeper in subsequent books, of what makes something or someone human?

{"username": "", "date": "2010s", "text": "Tim\n491 reviews\n837 followers\nFollow\nJune 6, 2018\nNote: There will be quotes in this review. Many of them. Murderbot is so delightfully quotable, that I think it speaks for itself better than I ever could.\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nIt’s borderline uncomfortable how much I relate to Murderbot. I really feel like I should not have anything in common with, well… a Murderbot, but I relate far more to this machine than pretty much any other protagonist I’ve read in some time. Murderbot is sarcastic, snide, a bit more kindhearted than one would expect given the name, but most of all, really just wants to be left alone with its hobbies.\n\n“It was a low-stress group, they didn’t argue much or antagonize each other for fun, and were fairly restful to be around, as long as they didn’t try to talk or interact with me in any way.”\n\nMurderbot is a security-based robot who is in charge of watching a group of scientists who have, for some reason, become a target for some unknown organization. They are on an isolated planet, their systems have been hacked, their maps are missing key points, hostile creatures want to eat them, other security robots are being reprogramed to attack them and worst of all they want to talk to Murderbot about its feelings.\n\n“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\"\n\nAs you may have noticed from the quotes, Murderbot is rather sarcastic, snide and humorously antisocial. It really would rather watch sci-fi soap operas and do its job (in its own words, in a rather “half assed fashion”), but people want to understand it, and yes, it does feel enough responsibility to want to keep its clients alive… well, most of them.\n\nThe book is rather hilarious. I hate to compare it to Douglas Adams, as Adams was more consistently absurd, but the humor throughout this book worked for me so well that I can honestly say I haven’t laughed this hard at a science fiction book since I originally ready The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and that is extremely high praise indeed.\n\nThis was almost a 5 star read for me. Its length is very short (around 150 pages) and had it been longer with expansion upon the plot and a more satisfactory ending, it probably would have made that last star. It also suffers a bit from having fairly forgettable meatbag… excuse me, I mean human characters. As things stand though, it is still a solid 4 star read and I’m looking forward to continuing the series at some point. It won me over with its loveable misanthropic protagonist, a great sense of humor and some genuinely interesting ideas.\n\n“I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.”\n\nWell said Murderbot! Well said!\n2010s\n \nhumor\n \nreviewed\n \n...more\n29 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2022-reads", "text": "Serge\n133 reviews\n42 followers\nFollow\nMay 1, 2022\nActual Rating: 2.75/5\n\n\n\n\nMurderbot, a cyborg that was able to hack into its governor module and gain independence, by not having to follow company commands, hates dealing with humans. It just wants to do its job and spend hours watching soap-operas. Unfortunately for Murderbot, the mission it's on gets exceptionally hectic, and it has to sacrifice its precious alone time to deal with the messy problems of messy humans. Throughout this debacle, Murderbot notices that these humans actually care for its well-being, and don't see it as a purely disposable machine that can be easily replaced. Even more shocking is the fact that Murderbot might just be slowly reciprocating these feelings back.\n\nThis is a short SF novella that is very much loved by the SF community, so I went into it with high expectations. However, it seems like I've found myself treading the dangerous \"Unpopular Opinionland\" with this one. This novella didn't elicit any feelings in me. Murderbot didn't really feel like a cyborg, and felt like just another grumpy old human who slowly softens up. I had trouble suspending my disbelief and convincing myself that a machine is capable of being this human like. The plot was utterly forgettable for me, and as I write this review after about 10 days of finishing the novella, I am truly struggling to remember what even happened. Perhaps I should have listened to the audiobook? Maybe hearing the narration might have immersed me more into this story... But as it stands, I can't really seem to see anything special here.\n\nI still want to give this series more of a try though, so I will be reading the next installment, or perhaps listening to it, hoping Murderbot will grow on me eventually.\n\n\n\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.

{"username": "", "date": "What a great read! I wasn't sure what to make of Martha Wells's All Systems Red at first, but Murderbot drew me in quickly. A construct made from cloned human material and robotic parts, Murderbot was created to provide security for various human clients.

I had a good feeling about this book when I found myself chuckling on the very first page. This was a story that I didn't want to start once I got started which worked out perfectly since it is short enough to be read in a couple of hours. I am glad that I finally decided to spend a little bit of time getting to know Murderbot.\n\nMuderbot is a SecUnit that is technically rogue since it decided to hack its own governor module. Obviously, Murderbot isn't letting anyone know that its governor module has been compromised because if the Company knew they would just get things working the way that they want once again. Murderbot has developed a fondness for human media since going rogue and loves to spend long hours viewing downloaded media.\n\nThe story was pretty exciting with some unexpected surprises along the way and plenty of action. I loved Murderbot's view of the world and the humor woven into the story. This is definitely a novella that science fiction fans will not want to miss.\n\nI won a digital copy of this book from Books of My Heart. Thanks, Anne!\n\nInitial Thoughts\nThis was great! This little story had everything that I hoped it would including great characters and an exciting story.

The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.\n\n\nI loved reading this, and it was exactly the escape that I needed: funny, interesting, and easy to read in a few sittings (probably just one sitting if you aren't perpetually tired). The main character is a half-human, half-construct that calls itself Murderbot and exists solely to act as a security detail on interplanetary missions, shooting anything that threatens the crew. This is surprisingly relatable—who wants to interact with anyone when they could be watching endless seasons of a soap opera and slacking off at work?—and extremely funny. There's quite a lot of action, and though it does feel like the plot is somewhat secondary to the Murderbot concept, the book gallops along so fast that it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe best thing about this book is that there are SIX MORE to read!!

It was really a charming adorable novella, easy to digest in a few hours. The main characters is a rather likable cyborg who was programmed to be a killer and defender, contracted from his corporate owner to defend whomever he is hired to defend. And to follow orders.\n\nAll Systems Red is primarily an action adventure story that gains dry comedy through the matter-of-fact attitude of the Murderbot. And there is a hint of emotional tension that arises from the fact that our \"hero\" has removed his control chip, just before his current mission. He no longer has to follow orders, so the question is what will he do with his new-found freedom.\n\nAdmittedly this story is short. A nugget more than a novel. Will be interesting to see if the author can do something worthwhile with her character in the next book in the series or if it turns out to have been just a gimmick. Fun for a quick read.\n28 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"}

A solid 4 stars.\n\nThis book feels like it takes the concepts from an Issac Asimov book, but puts more emotional depth into the robot and is also quite funny.\n\nThere has been a ton of hype around this book, and I am pleased to say that it has lived up to it. I'm not much of a science fiction fan, and typically prefer epic fantasy novels (the bigger/longer the better) -- but this book was captivating and puts a smile on your face throughout. I can't give it 5 stars because it didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading more from this series.\n\nOne big knock on this book is the heft price-tag. It costs $12 on kindle, but is only slightly longer than a novella and shouldn't take you more than a day or two to read. However, I was lucky enough to get this as my local library so it was free.\n30 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2022-04-19", "text": "Jennifer\n552 reviews\n313 followers\nFollow\nApril 19, 2022\nWell, here's the most charming unreliable narrator I've come across in ages: a security bot that has secretly hacked its way to autonomy and refers to itself by the name of Murderbot. Contrary to expectation, Murderbot prefers to keep to itself and binge-watch serials in between half-assing its job as security detail for scientists surveying a new planet.\n\nThings go dramatically wrong with giant toothy tunneling things, and then wrong in more troubling ways - autopilot failures, map inaccuracies, sudden silence from a sister survey team. Having hacked its governor module, Murderbot doesn't have to do anything, but it might just be able to save the day. If it wants. If it likes its humans enough. But whoa, feelings? Not Murderbot's cuppa.\n\nSo, I'm awkward with actual humans. It's not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it's not them; it's me. I know I'm a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous. Also, if I'm not in the armor then it's because I'm wounded and one of my organic parts may fall off and plop on the floor at any moment and no one wants to see that.\n\nAll Systems Red is an unusual coming-of-age (er, sentience?) story whose charm lies mostly in its quirky bot main character. Murderbot is indifferent to its job, feels utter contempt for the company that owns it (\"we're cheaply produced and we suck. Nobody would hire us for non-murdering purposes unless they had to\"), and fascinated with human entertainment media. Considering that there's a fair bit of violence in the story, Murderbot's detached perspective makes it a lighter read than it otherwise might be.\n\nI snorted out loud in amusement and solidarity more often than I probably should have:\n\nI'd watched three episodes of Sanctuary Moon and was fast forwarding through a sex scene when Dr. Mensah sent me some images through the feed. (I don't have any gender or sex-related parts (if a construct has those you're a sexbot in a brothel, not a murderbot) so maybe that's why I find sex scenes boring. Though I think that even if I did have sex-related parts I would find them boring.\n\n\nIt's a short novella at 149 pages, so the world-building and characters are lightly drawn but promising. I was disappointed that this planet's fauna are so overwhelmingly earthy (really, a different planet also evolved birds, insects, and reptiles?), but I liked the polyamory and non-traditional relationships between the humans and the complex tangle of politics and history beyond this planet.\n\nI'm up for spending more time in this world and have already requested the sequel. More Murderbot, please!\n29 likes\n11 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot doesn't particularly like people; in fact, they'd rather spend their time watching soap operas. They have also overridden their system to be able to make their own decisions, and we know they have a haunted past where something bad happened. On this particular mission, something goes awry, and this short novella examines that mystery, shows us who Murderbot is, and wraps it all up in a pretty neat package.\n\nFor me, there wasn't anything particularly special about this. It's quite short (the audiobook is just over 3 hours) and from my understanding this series doesn't have a full-length novel until book 5—so I presume the first 4 novellas are more like auxiliary material to introduce you to the characters and world. I sort of knew that going in but still wasn't prepared for how simple and, honestly, boring this book was. Murderbot has some quirky qualities and his internal monologue had that sassy robot point-of-view, but it never made me laugh out loud.\n\nI think this is one of those things I chalk up to personal preference. I don't have anything bad to say about this, it just wasn't for me. I'm debating whether I should bother continuing with the series because if this one is just setting up the world, it feels harsh to give up after just book 1. But also if they don't really change much, then I doubt I'm going to love them. Would appreciate hearing feedback in the comments!\naudiobook\n \nshort-novels\n29 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

There were soooo many jokes that he made sound boring and clumsy. Instead, I imagined how one friend of mine in particular would read it, for she is basically an all-human, gun-less Murderbot and it was instantly at least 80x more entertaining. I will read the next one with my eyes, or ask her if she'll read it to me.\n\n-It is still pretty light. It's just fun. It's short, to the point, nothing super dramatic. It entertains.

I actually plan to see if I can find the additional books in the series so I can find out what happens next.\n\nThis was a book club pick for me for December.

As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do.

{"username": "", "date": "2022-04-05", "text": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship\n1,419 reviews\n2,010 followers\nFollow\nApril 5, 2022\nI shouldn’t have liked this book. It’s very science fiction, with comms and feeds and HubSystems and MedSystems in nearly every paragraph, and as far as I can tell it also has planet-spanning cultures that are basically Modern American with one or two tweaks, and a generic aspect to the setting, seen for example in people’s consuming “food pacs” rather than any actual cuisine. Not only that, it’s definitely a space mystery/thriller; I find comparison to Firefly apt, and I stopped watching Firefly after the third episode (the horror one). This book, too, has a bit where we run around a station in which everyone has been brutally massacred and the killers are hiding—though happily, it doesn’t lean into the horror elements.\n\nAnd yet, I did thoroughly enjoy the novella, reading the whole book in one sitting. It has a sci-fi setting and a thriller plot, but it’s really a story about characters and relationships. Readers love Murderbot, which makes sense since it (awkward pronouns for a character but the ones used in the actual book! I read it as mostly male but have been interested to see others’ differing interpretations) is quite endearing: socially awkward and mostly interested in retreating to private spaces to consume media, but programmed for heroism and increasingly invested in protecting its group of humans. That so many people are drawn so strongly to a character who hates human interaction, half-asses their job and just wants to watch trash TV perhaps speaks to cultural malaise, but here we are. And Murderbot has a great voice.\n\nThe scientists, meanwhile, are quite well-drawn given Bot’s disinterest in their appearances, lives or emotions—the reader winds up with a solid sense of who these people are, and I found their dynamics as a group of friends engaging and believable. Insecure authors who feel the need to telegraph everything about everyone through their point-of-view character to the point that it borders on preternatural (“I saw fear on his face, followed by determination, with a hint of smugness quickly concealed….”) should read this book as a great example of how much about a character can be conveyed through their words and actions alone. I wound up liking the group of scientists quite a bit, especially the growing friendship between Bot and Dr. Mensah, which is lovely.\n\nI do have a couple of criticisms that don’t simply boil down to disliking sci-fi. A couple of plot and setting elements are rather unconvincing. \nFirst, I have doubts about the viability of murderbots: of course it’s handy that they can easily regenerate from what for a human would be a catastrophic injury, while being programmed for selfless obedience. However, not only are they extremely expensive to create, but they apparently go rogue often enough that a group that wants to prevent questions being asked thinks that staging this as their cover story for murder is a good idea. And rogue bots can slaughter dozens of people singlehandedly. Seems like a team of human security guards, perhaps supplemented by fully artificial robots, would be both safer and cheaper. Second, if what the evil survey group wants is exclusive rights to mine the planet without anyone else’s realizing it’s an archaeological site, secretly murdering the other survey groups seems extreme: have they considered just buying exclusive rights immediately and then evicting the others before they discover the truth? Why wouldn’t the political entities that bought the rights for the original surveys not send new survey groups if the first ones were killed by malfunctioning security bots that have nothing to do with the actual planet? And then, the ending perhaps wraps up more than such a short book calls for: \nBot’s being owned by the corporation could have been milked for a lot more drama, which makes me wonder if Wells wrote this one without any guarantee there would be sequels, or if she just didn’t like that angle.\n\nAt any rate, I definitely did enjoy this, unusually for a novella; and the novella format probably helped, reducing the impact of elements I don’t ordinarily like. I plan to continue to the sequel, though I’d also love it if subsequent books were a bit less mystery/thriller than this.\n4-stars\n \nfavorites\n \nscience-fiction\n \n...more\n27 likes\n16 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The self labelled ‘murdebot’ — an android made up of the latest tech & software — has hacked its own module, the module that ensures it is self-aware and not completely subservient to the humans as it should be — creating a fun, engaging, easy to follow consciousness where the android is trying to discover who it really is and where it allegiances lie.\n\nThen when a neighbouring mission goes bad, things get serious and it is here where All systems red goes from fun to ferociously-addictive, with twists and turns, black comedy, hopelessness and at its core the central message permeates every plot point, absorbing every paragraph due to it being the heartbeat of all human or non-human consciousness — The search for self, identity, meaning and spirituality, the walk of life!\n\nMurderbot — as discovered this time round, that is read so well by Kevin Free & also brilliantly dramatised in a new late 2023 release — thanks to its magnificent, one-of-a-kind self-consciousness and subsequent rationale, created by its hacking of its own system — is truly a paradox and paradigm, that also has an insatiable appetite for killing — this android is no robot! It’s self-deprecating, has a roller-coasting mental state that feels more human than any of the humans in the story, and becomes the near-perfect flawed protagonist you just cannot help but root for with legitimate passion and fervour — Even upon a recent quick re-read before I tackle Book Two and beyond, it was paramountly evident that Martha Wells world of high-tech, space madness is of a certain genius that perhaps has yet to be fully appreciated for the creative brilliance it deserves.\nadult-fiction\n \nai-robot-scifi-fiction\n \nfantasy-sci-fi-futuristic\n \n...more\n27 likes\n5 comments\nLike\nComment"}

It felt like an episode of a sci-fi show with its own contained story that after finishing it, one is already queuing up the next one.\n\nI saw this book recommended everywhere sometime after one of its sequels had come out but for some reason the premise didn't pique my interest. It wasn't until I kept seeing more sequels be hyped up and still exceed expectations that I decided I had to start it someday.\n\nThis was my first book by Wells and it definitely won't be the last.\n\n–– Spoilers ––\n\n\nHighlights\n- Murderbot was great, it definitely stole the show, even if it was its to begin with, hahaha. The part where it used the room's cameras to help its shyness with the humans was definitely a mood.\n\n- A robot that is as obsessed with series as humans is definitely something I hadn't expected. Hope to see more references to Sanctuary Moon in other installments.\n\n- Dr. Mensah was a great counterpart to Muderbot as the captain of the survey group. She was calm and collected when needed, and with the help of Murderbot they were able to save the whole crew. She too was my favorite human.\n\n- The pacing was marvelous, it never felt like a chore to keep on reading. I'm eager to read the next ones as I have seen they are much bigger in size than this one.\n\n- The names from Murderbot's humans were intriguing: Overse and Volescu being my favorite of the bunch, name-wise.\n\nNitpicking (jokingly)\n- Dr. Mensah (name sounds like \"dumb/stupid\" in Spanish) and Kilos as a unit of length (Kilo is a unit of mass in Spanish)\n- Weird but lovable names but kept forgetting their genders.\n\nExpectations\n- If the series's hype continues, I definitely can see Murderbot become a staple robot/AI in pop culture.\n- I hope, later rather than sooner, we meet again with the survey group.\n\nautomata\n \nfirst-book-by-author\n \nfunny\n \n...more\n26 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2019-12-02", "text": "Jacob Proffitt\n3,309 reviews\n2,152 followers\nFollow\nDecember 2, 2019\nThis novella has an airy tone that ends up delivering a punchy catharsis. The unnamed SecUnit that calls itself Murderbot is self-contained and wary while it hides that it disabled the governor unit that is supposed to control its actions. So it doesn't have to follow orders but it also doesn't want that fact discovered. So while the adventure/mystery story unfolds at a fast pace an undercurrent of autonomy and identity plays out in the background.\n\nThis undercurrent is highlighted by the group of humans Murderbot is working for/with. They're well-meaning and determined and lead by a woman with strong convictions and a quick mind. So when they discover that it is ungoverned, their reactions range from intrusively sympathetic to actively suspicious, giving the story scope (however slight) to explore those buried themes.\n\nI thought at first that the action/mystery dominated that under-theme but I think Wells ends up using that to build the connection-through-adversity that forms the framework for the eventual resolution. Which delivers that punchy catharsis that brought me all the feelz.\n\nSo I'm giving this an unmitigated five stars, because I'm all about the feelz. But I'll note that the distance between underlying theme (autonomy and identity) and the story frame (action/mystery) in such a short work is enough that it'll be disconcerting to those who want more of one or the other. And I'll agree with Tadiana that the characterization for the rest of the crew is shallow. But I didn't care. I was all about the Murderbot/Mensah connection and that ending slew me.\naction\n \nmystery\n \nsci-fi\n27 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Finally. A main character I can relate to.\n\nI have very little to say about this one to be honest. The action was fun and fast-paced, the world-building was interesting and easily digestible, and of course, the main character, dearest Murderbot, was marvelous.\n\nAs an autistic person, I dislike when autistic people are compared to robots. But also as an autistic person, it was almost impossible for me not to notice the parallels.\nMurderbot hating eye contact and struggling with facial expressions, not understanding 'basic' etiquette, their love of serials and often using the serials to understand the world around them.\n\nGetting to read a story in which a character with these traits is readily accepted and welcomed by those around them just gave me so many warm, fuzzy feelings.\n\nMy only real complaint is that I wish I got to know the crew a little better. Though, with the word count and the size of the crew, I suppose it's understandable. Hopefully they make another appearance in one of the many other Murderbot installments.

And I must say, he was correct. The self-proclaimed “murderbot” was humorous, loved binge watching tv, and found the humans irritating while simultaneously needing to protect them. Like the SecUnit, I am self aware, so I understand why this character compares to me. Though, to my knowledge, I am fully human and not a cyborg. Anyway, I don’t typically say this, but I actually think this book is better suited as a script for a tv series. The book itself was fairly boring, but I could visualize the potential on-screen impact. I look forward to watching the series and hope it can make a 3 star book, a 5 star televisual experience.\n27 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Well that was a fun little diversion. And by little, I mean LITTLE! This is, hands down, the shortest book I've read all year. And also probably the easiest read I've done all year. Given my penchant for reading large and/or heady books, this one was pretty much a \"blink and you'll miss it\" deviation for me. It was also our book club pick following the behemoth that was Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, and we chose it because it was an easy read, which we felt was necessary after wading through the 1000+ pages of TWoK.\n\nSo what did I think of All Systems Red? Well, it was...good. That's about the best I can come up with at the moment. I loved the idea of a rogue Security bot that hacked its own governor, stopped caring about the corporate mission, and decided to basically be a TV junkie. And the fact that it refers to itself as Murderbot was just priceless. But outside of those concepts, the story just didn't really move me like I hoped it would.\n\nPart if this is, I'm sure, due to the brevity of the tale. There's not a lot of room for character arcs or deep plotting in a story this short. And I get it...it's not supposed to be a monster story. This is popcorn entertainment, and it achieves that goal rather well. But, that being said, I still was left feeling a little cold after reading All Systems Red. Nobody really gets any backstory or context, the people in the tale are essentially just random people who are assigned various archetypes and behaviors to stand out. I never got much of a visual of any of them. As for Murderbot, while admired the snarky way in which it narrated its tale, I still wanted to know more about it, and this never really came to pass.\n\nAnother thing that took away from my enjoyment is the way in which the narrative unfolds. I've read several books where the storytelling was...incidental at best. But All Systems Red takes the cake. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was just kind of half-explained or defined. From the action to the locations to the characters themselves, nothing is written in much detail. In fact, the action scenes were comprised mostly of passages that read something like \"I ran at it while shooting my projectile weapon. It was shooting at me at the same time. I got hit a few times, but I managed to find a vital area on my opponent and take it down.\" And...that's it. The problem with writing like this is it robs the story of any sense of drama or suspense. It's all so...casual. And that casual writing makes the narrative casual as well, which doesn't help to engage the reader as much.\n\nBecause this is a short novella, we jump from sequence to sequence pretty quickly, but even on things that I felt should have been given more weight, Martha Wells just kinda glosses over them. Not having read any of her other works, I can't say if this is just how she writes, or if she had to constrain herself to keep the story short & sweet. Again, I wanted more.\n\nBut it's not all bad! Murderbot is a fun narrator, and carries the first person POV tale quite well. I enjoyed the snark, the sarcasm, and the flippancy in which it viewed most situations it found itself in. I loved how anti-social Murderbot was, and how it really just wanted to be left alone to watch its video entertainment...aka soap operas.\n\nThe overall concept is also rather cool, but I feel that this could have been far more impactful as either a full-length novel or a larger novella. I wanted more heft with my tale, and I never received that. But I can see the potential here, and given that this is the first in a series of books, I think Martha Wells can certainly take this character in interesting directions. The ending of this one opens up all sorts of possibilities, and I'd like to see what is next for Murderbot.", "text": "Jack\nAuthor \n6 books\n149 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 14, 2017\nWell that was a fun little diversion.

In fact, the action scenes were comprised mostly of passages that read something like \"I ran at it while shooting my projectile weapon. It was shooting at me at the same time. I got hit a few times, but I managed to find a vital area on my opponent and take it down.\" And...that's it. The problem with writing like this is it robs the story of any sense of drama or suspense. It's all so...casual. And that casual writing makes the narrative casual as well, which doesn't help to engage the reader as much.\n\nBecause this is a short novella, we jump from sequence to sequence pretty quickly, but even on things that I felt should have been given more weight, Martha Wells just kinda glosses over them. Not having read any of her other works, I can't say if this is just how she writes, or if she had to constrain herself to keep the story short & sweet. Again, I wanted more.\n\nBut it's not all bad! Murderbot is a fun narrator, and carries the first person POV tale quite well. I enjoyed the snark, the sarcasm, and the flippancy in which it viewed most situations it found itself in. I loved how anti-social Murderbot was, and how it really just wanted to be left alone to watch its video entertainment...aka soap operas.\n\nThe overall concept is also rather cool, but I feel that this could have been far more impactful as either a full-length novel or a larger novella. I wanted more heft with my tale, and I never received that. But I can see the potential here, and given that this is the first in a series of books, I think Martha Wells can certainly take this character in interesting directions. The ending of this one opens up all sorts of possibilities, and I'd like to see what is next for Murderbot.\n26 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

It must figure out humans and how to act robot to keep his sentience a secret, not least because it had disabled certain modules in order to preserve its exercise of free will and a mortal’s sense of self-preservation amongst others. At the root, it now has to grapple with having opinions and feelings which necessitates understanding the nuances of human interactions including facial expressions and reading between the lines in order preserve its secret and later, to express his opinions and cooperate with humans to investigate possible breaches, criminal or fraudulent activities. In other words, Murderbot demonstrates both primary and secondary thinking by understanding learned behaviours, social conventions and personal goals as it deduces human and corporate motives.\n\nMurderbot feels beyond basic feelings and emotions which extends to disgust, betrayal and even a fiddly form of empathy. Like an introvert, it prefers solitude because it gets overwhelmed or rather, irritated with social interactions, preferring to spend time doing what it wills. Its relationship with humans can be described as a form of reverse anthropomorphism—humans don’t know how to categorise it and thus, the appropriate way to act around it while the murderbot tries to blend in with the humans as an android with hilarious results. Consequently, the book provides an opportunity to look into the human condition, facilitated by the juxtaposition of an augmented human character. Readers could then decide at what point a person or a robot becomes a machine and ceases to be human or vice versa, along with the ethical implications.\n\nWriting as a socially awkward human, murderbot tickles me when it analyses, quite ungracefully, (romantic) interpersonal relations, the surrounding drama and a series called ‘sanctuary moon’ it obsessively follows. The series is fascinating and I cannot wait to read and watch the rest of it.\n28 likes\nLike\nComment"}

It's really interesting to experience a story from the viewpoint of a robot. I loved how (I'm going to call it a she because I felt like the bot was female presenting) really just wanted to do her job and watch her soap operas. How relatable was that?\n\nAnyway, this book rocked. It has was short and sweet. It had me laughing at Murderbot's POV and how she interacted with and viewed her humans that she was protecting. She's pretty badass and has a killer sense of humor. I feel like we could be friends because I often just want to be left alone and allowed to watch tv or paint or draw or sew doll clothes and not deal with people. I love how she didn't read the software updates because she didn't care enough. It's so so relatable. She used a lot of her memory to download her soap opera videos that she liked to watch. LOL! For what it's worth, I think this would make a good series or movie. Netflix are you paying attention?\n\nI gave it 4.5 stars because there were some parts I felt a little confused, and I wished it was longer.\n1st-person-pov\n \n2021-action-adventure-aficionados-c\n \n2021-action-heroine-fans-yearly-cha\n \n...more\n29 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

It uses its freedom to keep doing its job while watching series on its memory storage. It doesn't really care about its job as a SecUnit, protecting humans who go on scientific explorations, and is quite content being ignored and seen as a robot, because when human interaction starts it gets complicated.\n\nThe plot of this novella is compelling. Things keep going wrong on the expedition, and the humans Murderbot works for are a bit different that the ones it usually encounters.\n\nMurderbot's pessimism, its tendency towards anxiety and depression, mixed with the care and affection it develops towards who it begins to consider its humans, is endearing (even if it sounds like it's not), relateable, and often leads to comedic moments born from the first person narration.\n\nThe book is just so much fun to read, and while its plot is mostly self contained, it also acts as a wonderful setup for the rest of the series.\nHighly, highly recommend this one!\nasexual-spectrum\n \naudio\n \ncomfort-reads\n \n...more\n25 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Its lackadaisical attention to detail, its frequent criticisms of how cheap the company that created it is, and its awkwardness with the crew, made this story surprisingly charming and funny.\n\nThe ending was perfect for a novella, closing off this chapter for Murderbot, and making me anxious to see where it goes to next.\n\nThis was my second Martha Wells (the other was City of Bones quite a while ago), and I'm glad there are plenty more yet to read.

In this one, we follow a crew that is on a planet doing research on this planet. Included in this crew is Murderbot who is part human and part robot. Murderbot is not your typical robot unit as this unit has cut off its connection to a governor module which controls actions. Basically, Murderbot has freewill.\n\nWhat a terrific introduction to this new series. The selling point so far was the point of view. The point of view is from Murderbot and I absolutely loved it. To see the action from a point of view that was not totally human had me immediately interested in the story. Even though the main character isn't totally human we get to see whether the main character wants to binge watch a series and the interaction with humans. It was an excellent look into human interaction and also a question of sentience. The only reason I could not give this a full five stars was that this wasn't a full length novel. This needed some more world building and also more development of the minor characters. That being said, I was enthralled throughout.\n\nI have seen this series constantly in my Goodreads feed and I finally thought I would give it a try. This is another example of why I love Goodreads because I probably would have never known about this series. I loved it and this easily fits into my science fiction itch. I am a fan and I really look forward into the second offering.\n24 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Megan is reading them aloud to me - we're in a brief pause since she had to order physical copies of the next few - and omg. What a delight! Murderbot, despite the name, is such an endearing character and narrator, and I loved the fact that the core of the story wasn't so much the plot, per se, as it was Murderbot's developing relationship with its humans and feelings about itself. Quality Robot Content right here. Quality Scientist Content too - the \"oh no, what about our samples?\" moment was priceless.\n\nAbsolutely excellent, the kind of good writing I've come to expect from Martha Wells applied to a great sci-fi setting. Can't wait for the next ones to get here.\n\nP.S. I found myself thinking of two Escape Pod stories while Megan read this to me - Cat Pictures, Please and Fandom For Robots, so if you, too, would like to have stories about excellent robots read aloud to you, check those out.\nfavorite-2020-reads\n \nnicole-reads-to-me\n \nreviewed\n \n...more\n24 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I've read this book so many times now that I should be able to recite parts of it! I certainly know when to expect what. Somehow this recording felt shorter than the one narrated by Kevin R Free, but I checked and they are the same length.\n\nDavid Cui Cui did a good job of inhabiting Murderbot. I could tell Gurathin and Ratthi apart quite easily. Ratthi had a light Scots accent, while Gurathin had a much deeper voice. It was the women's voices that I struggled with. Eventually I got Mensah sorted out and sometimes Pin-Lee, but mostly because I know a lot of the dialogue by heart, not because the voices were clearly different.\n\nStill, it was another enjoyable visit with Murderbot and I have requested Artificial Condition: Dramatized Adaptation. These are popular, so I'm going to be waiting a while, but that's fine by me.

We needed an audiobook to interest four people from two generations. Furthermore, it needed to be around 3 hours in length, as we planned to listen while we worked on a jigsaw puzzle this afternoon and we wanted to complete a full story experience with a beginning, middle and ending, rather than starting something we couldn't finish.\n\nI entered my search criteria into Google and considered the results. I was pleased to discover this one was already on my to read list on good reads. Our interest was piqued while listening to an excerpt and it was available for download on Hoopla through our local public library.\n\nWe quickly became engaged in the story and there were many laughs out loud along the way. Great narration by Kevin R. Free enhanced our listening experience. The language and vocabulary were captivating and the characters came to life in our imaginations. We love that we can repeat this experience as there are more volumes in this series!\n\nPhrase that consistently made me laugh, \"non-organic parts.\"\nscience-fiction\n24 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The book doesn't overstay its welcome and manages to pack a tight little story in under 200 pages. And it looks like its building a world that will continue on with a new book slated for this year.

{"username": "", "date": "Martha Wells’ novella about a disaffected robot struggling with identity issues is like a set of Russian nesting dolls: there are stories within stories. It's an impressive accomplishment and Wells says more in 144 pages than most authors do in their 1,000-page trilogies.\n\nThe main story arc is a high-octane adventure about a sentient robot assigned to protect a group of scientists on their survey of a planet from sabotage, man-eating wildlife, and armed invaders from another company determined to take control of the planet at any cost. But the SecUnit assigned to protect the small survey group is a rogue agent with some serious psychological issues…MURDERBOT.\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nMurderbot is the AI version of the sensitive loner in high school. The edgy introvert who would rather read Jack Kerouac than attend social events. Lightning fast and armed with energy cannons, Murderbot is a fighting machine that doesn’t want to fight. It’s a reluctant hero who would rather be left alone to watch media, but it feels a responsibility to get the hapless humans to safety. Like so many readers, I related to Murderbot from page one and loved its sarcastic sense of humor. Despite its preference for mainlining galactic soap operas, there are plenty of gun fights and last-minute rescues for readers who want a fun adventure story.\n\nI knew I could kill everyone on the hopper, even with a blown hip joint and one working arm. So I grabbed the hand weapon on the seat, turned it toward my chest, and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe second story arc is about free will, personhood, and the future of AI. SecUnits like Murderbot are leased out by their corporate owners to protect human clients; they are considered property rather than people. While robots can be citizens in some territories outside corporate space, they are second-class citizens at best who are required to have human guardians. Sentience and the desire for self-determination are not sufficient for bots to be free or equal to humans. The author contrasts Murderbot’s experience with Gurathin, a human cyborg on the survey team. While both Murderbot and Gurathin are part organic and part machine, Gurathin is a citizen with all the attendant rights, simply because he was born human. Murderbot was built in a lab, so it despite its intelligence, cloned human tissue, and the ability to have feelings, it is considered a machine no different than a PC. Murderbot is trying to decide who it wants to be and how it wants to live in a society that doesn't allow it to make either of those decisions.\n\nIt’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. That makes it sound like the halves are discrete…as opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity.\n\nFinally, and least developed, is the story arc about the future of humanity after we colonize space. Given the page limits of a novella, Wells just sketches in brief outlines of humanity and governance across various worlds. The book takes place in the Corporate Rim, where multi-planet companies rule and money is the only thing that matters. Murderbot blandly notes that the company that leased it to the survey group would certainly take bribes from an opposing survey group and says the only reason the company wouldn’t conspire to murder its clients is because the death payouts would be too high. Meanwhile, the survey group is from a democratic planet called Perseverance in non-corporate space, which values human rights, decency, and the rule of law. Bots have limited rights under those laws, and the survey group wants Murderbot to return with them to their liberal planet. Basically, you have unchecked capitalism vs. democratic socialism as co-existing philosophies in space, although it's unclear how that happened.\n\nI’m docking half a star because I enjoy complex world-building (e.g., John Scalzi) and would have loved to read more about the different star systems. I also felt that most of the secondary characters were underdeveloped. I wish Wells had written a full-length novel that fleshed out the characters, especially Mensah, the courageous and compassionate team leader who bonds most closely with Murderbot.

Murderbot (it refers to itself as such, but never out loud) is a Sec Unit - a half human, half robot construct - who's hacked its own Governor Module and has gained free will. However, instead of slaughtering its human overlords, Murderbot has decided to keep its day-job guarding humans, and streams a boatload of TV shows in its downtime.\n\nMurderbot is on a standard assignment, acting as security for a research team from the Preservation Alliance, lead by Dr. Mensa. Distrustful of humans, Murderbot just wants to do its job and watch The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon for the millionth time. But, when a neighboring mission goes mysteriously dark, its up to Murderbot and its humans to figure out the truth.\n\nAll Systems Red is a fabulous first-installment in what is now one of my favorite series. Thanks, I'm obsessed.\n\nMurderbot is one of my all-time favorite characters. How could I not love this anti-social, grumpy, achingly sentimental human-robot construct? Not only is Murderbot hilarious - its reluctance to do anything but stream TV shows and be away from humans was so relatable - there's also a wounded, surprisingly vulnerable aspect to Murderbot's personality. Most humans see Sec Units as murderous androids that are little more than weapons, but that's far from true. They are essentially sentient humanoid constructs that are enslaved by humanity, and mistreatment of androids within the Corporation Rim is a sad reality. Murderbot does not trust humans, because it knows the levels of cruelty and ignorance humans are capable of.\n\nHowever, Murderbot finds the current group of human its protecting to be...different. And wouldn't you know it, Murderbot is starting to care about them.\n\n\n\n“They were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. I can't do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans.”\n\n\n\nI loved Murderbot's relationships with its new clients so much, and I thoroughly enjoyed the human characters: Dr. Mensa, Ratthi, Pin-Lee, Arada, Overse, Volescu, Bharadwaj, and even Gurathin were all wonderful, and I loved witnessing their growing fondness of Murderbot. My heart is full to bursting.\n\nThe mystery had me on the edge of my seat, I cared so very deeply for Murderbot and its clients, and I had such a fun time reading from Murderbot's perspective. Its narration is wholly distinct, dry, witty, and endearingly awkward and pessimistic. I just love Murderbot, okay? I want to be Murderbot's friend, even though I know it'd want nothing to do with me since I'm a human. But...AH. I LOVE THIS SERIES.\n\n\n\n“It’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.”\n\n\n\nIf you haven't noticed, I'm a big fan of this series. If you haven't read All Systems Red, do yourself a favor and pick this up on audio. The narrator perfectly captures Murderbot's voice, and they're so enjoyable to listen to!\n\n...\n\n“I don't know what I want. I said that at some point, I think. But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.”\n2021-books\n \nnovellas\n \nsci-fi\n \n...more\n23 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

All Systems Red is something a little bit different. The prose and plot are quite basic but the Murderbot makes up for this by being extremely relatable. The Murderbot is anxious, awkward and just wants to be left alone to watch his shows but Wells still manages to tuck in a little bit of murder for good measure. A quick read that is easily finished in one sitting and easily accessible to sci-fi newbies and veterans alike.\n\nI have to mark this novella down for its high price point, costing almost as much as a novel four times it's length! A lower price or perhaps a package deal for the series would improve its rating.\n23 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I gave in.\n\nThanks, Goodreads! I loved it. Not in any profoundly deep, or profoundly literary sense. It was a simple story told in a profoundly entertaining way.\n\nMurderbot is a singular security construct (part human-ish, part machine) owned and leased out by The Company. Their latest contract involves protecting a small group of researchers surveying an unexplored planet.\n\nNow, Murderbot is unique: they've managed to disable their own governance system, so they essentially have the freedom to act as they choose – and to ignore any directives given to them by The Company and the team they are programmed to protect.\n\nWe all know how this “Awakening AI Casts Off the Shackles” storyline goes, right? The murderous uprising is about to begin! Yes?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat Murderbot does with their new-found autonomy is this:\n\nThey do their job. Yes, they do it with the least amount of effort possible. But they do their job. And in every spare second they have, they secretly download and consume all the entertainment streaming they can fit in their memory. They binge watch. And hope they can avoid as much social interaction as possible.\n\nMurderbot is all of us. Murderbot is supremely relatable.\n\nThis should be on the top of your TBR list.\nfun-to-read\n \nreviewed\n \nsometerrifyingspacemonkeysgotloose\n23 likes\n11 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Σίγουρα το καλύτερο στοιχείο ήταν το ίδιο το ρομπότ το οποίο έχει χακάρει την μητρική του και έχει πλέον ελεύθερη βούληση. Μπορεί να μην το χάρηκα πολύ ώρα ως χαρακτήρα αλλά ο σαρκασμός του και η επιθυμία του να μην ασχοληθεί με τίποτα άλλο πέρα απο το να βλέπει σειρές στο κεφάλι του με έκαναν να το αγαπήσω.\n\nΟ πλανήτης είχε φοβερό ενδιαφέ��ον και το μυστήριο με είχε ιντριγκάρει απο την αρχή. Οι υπόλοιποι χαρακτήρες επίσης ήταν συμπαθητικοί και μου άρεσαν οι συναναστροφές τους. Ωστόσο δεν βλέπουν αρκετά τίποτα απο όλα αυτά. Είχε τα συσ��ατικά για μια επική περιπέτεια αλλά δυστυχώς πάνω στο καλό η ιστορία τελείωσε. Σίγουρα θα συνεχίσω τη σειρά να δώ τι άλλο θα γίνει.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf this was a full length book instead of a novella, it would have been perhaps my favourite scifi ever. The best part was the robot itself. It has hacked its own system and gained free will. It's incredibly witty and full of sarcasm and just didn't give a damn about anything apart from wanting to watch tv shows in his head in peace.\n\nThe planet was very interesting and the mystery intrigued me from the start. The other characters were also very likeable. Again it had all the necessary components for an epic adventure but unfortunately the story ended too soon.\n\nI'll definitely continue with the series. I'm curious to see what will happen next in the murderbot's life.\nfav-main-characters\n \nshort-stories\n \nwill-buy-physical-copy\n22 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Искам за пореден път да изкажа комплиментите си към издателството, което не само раздвижи комикс-нишата у нас, ами се зае да ни представи и някои образци на съвременната фантастика, при това в разкошно оформени томове с твърди корици и меки обложки, радващи окото.\n\nСамото произведение, макар да е обрало куп награди, не блести с особена оригиналност, както вече са споменали и други читатели в отзивите си - историята за изкуствения човек, сдобил се със свободна воля, е дъвкана и предъвквана, обаче лично на мен изпълнението (или кавър версията, ако предпочитате) на Марта Уелс доволно се понрави. Изреченията бяха кратки, а езикът суховат и наситен със специфична терминология (нищо неразбираемо, спокойно), за да ни вкара в ума на бота-разказвач. Желанието му просто да бъде оставен на мира, за да гледа сериалите, към които явно се е пристрастил, но все пак решил да доведе мисията си до успешен край, също ми се стори доста готино – като неспирно даващ дежурства в две болници напълно я разбирам тая Единица за сигурност. Имаше и лек екшън, макар мотивацията на конфликта, респективно действията на лошите, да не ми се сториха съвсем убедителни. И все пак, прекарах няколко часа наистина забавлявайки се, затова ще бъда щедър в крайната оценка 4,5/5\nколекция-небюла\n22 likes\n10 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The audio book is only 3+ hours long and I was able to listen to it at 1.5x speed without any trouble at all.\n\nI’ve heard lots of people refer to\nMurderbot with female pronouns. That was harder for me, since the narrator of this version was male (who was ok but not brilliant), but it was quite easy to think of it as genderless, especially after it explained that it truly was non-binary. It liked to watch SF soap operas, but I don’t think that is enough to make it more feminine. Whatever. I was more struck by Murderbot’s discomfort when revealing itself to humans, eye contact and physical contact of any kind made it want to run away. Later it was explained that it was just shy, but it made me think of someone on the spectrum. And if androids who’ve hacked their own programming aren’t neuro-diverse, I don’t know who/what is.\n\nThe story was quite simple, a mystery to be solved and stay alive at the same time all in SF clothing. It was quite simply fun. Well written and easy to follow, with a few fresh ideas thrown in there. I’m looking forward to more stories about Murderbot.\nscience-fiction\n22 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person. Murderbot really does not like interacting with people and would rather be on her own. She really doesn't take her job seriously and is quite sarcastic. Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a short adventure, mystery on an unnamed planet.\n\nAs with all Wells novels this is a fast-paced well written story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The survey team comes under attack, people are killed, an unknown adversary. The story works as we get to learn more about our nonhuman protagonist. I really like this book and wish it was a full length novel. I am a huge fan of Martha Wells and can't wait to read more from this.\ne-books\n \nread-2017\n21 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I love the main character, a security bot contracted by a science research group on a planetary survey, who is terribly shy and self-conscious around humans and only wants to watch tv all day. I probably relate a bit too much to it as an introvert😂, but its monologues and awkward conversations with humans are so hilarious that it's hard to not find it overwhelmingly cute!\n\nThe story itself is also gripping with a perfect mix of suspense and action. The plot is fast-paced but never feels rushed, and I honestly didn't notice that I was reading a novella because the story is fleshed out really well. My only slight complaint is that the ending \nis a bit unsatisfying. Not that I only like HEAs but I thought after all the buildup, Murderbot would be able to accept humans as its friends? Being bought doesn't necessarily mean it was a slave and had to follow its owner's orders ... The fact that it just left without a goodbye felt too coldhearted to me, after all the effort the humans put in to save it and give it freedom. But maybe that is the point because Murderbot is not a person after all.\n\nAs much as I enjoy this book, however, I find it slightly surprising that it won both the Hugo and Nebula. From what I've learned with a limited sample size, literary awards tend to reserve their spotlights for works that address social issues, explore complex topics of humanity, etc. This book didn't come across as deep in thematics to me, though it's possible that I missed something. Nonetheless, that didn't take away any of my reading pleasure and I can't wait to see what the sequels have to offer!\nnovella\n \nowned\n \nscience-fiction\n21 likes\nLike\nComment"}

That said though doesn't mean it was a good read. I didn't hate it, but neither did I like it. It was just interesting enough to finish. I won't be finishing the series, however. I also found it to be a bit slow. And no book that is less than 150 pages long has any business being slow.\n\n\nHow I choose my rating:\n1* Didn't like it at all. These are rare as I usually just don't finish any book I dislike this much.\n2** Didn't like it. Again usually DNF if I dislike it this much, but occasionally I feel it still has potential and I try to stick with it to the end. Probably won't finish the series if part of one.\n3*** I liked it. It wasn't great but it was enjoyable enough. It is unlikely I'll ever reread it but I'll probably finish the series if it is a part of one.\n4**** I really liked this book. Maybe not a work of genius, but highly entertaining. I might reread this at some point, and I will finish the series if part of one.\n5***** I loved this book. I found little to no issues with it at all. I will probably reread this and possibly more than once.

I am always sceptical (I guess possibly too sceptical) about books that are universally praised but this I have to say deserved it. The book itself is relatively short not reaching 170 pages and yet so much goes on.\n\nI can see now why people enjoy this book (as did I) as it has that great mix of action and entertaining dialogue - lets hope that when it reaches the screen they are able to keep this mix too.\n\nI think also there is a fascinating world being created here and from looking at the early pages of the second book it is only going to be built upon. So in short a fun read with some very interesting ideas thrown in too, and yes I will admit my name those who are recommending it.\n21 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I didn’t really care for the main “murderbot” character. I just wanted it to end.

The idea of an AI beyond humans' control is not novel, but very rarely do you get to see the world through said AI's eyes. Murderbot is funny, a bit antisocial and surprisingly relatable. I'm eager to continue this series, not only to follow Murderbot's exploits but also to find out more about the world and the infamous 'Company'.\npopsugar-2020\n \nread-2020\n24 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Seriously, I thought this book would be so serious, but it turned out to be quite different than I thought. Following around an android who is obsessed with serial shows and finding its own personality than protecting the people its supposed to protect is a funny premise. You have to give it that.\n\nFor the first bit of the story, you get an idea of what kind of work Murderbot did and how it worked amongst other humans. For the most part, it felt like the humans wanted to be friends with the bot, but also realized that it's a security android there to protect them. Luckily for them, the android is smart enough to know when it's being messed around with and the kind of damage it can do if placed in the wrong hands.\n\nI liked how compact this story was. Since it's a novella, there's not a lot of room to discuss the intricate components of the world, but within one story on one mission, you get all that you need to know about Murderbot and its programming. In the end, I really like stories like this where it's one story and then it moves on. I liked this introduction to this character and the way its done really shows the relationship between humans and androids and how precarious it is. I mean, one is a living breathing entity while the other is a robot.\n\nI also liked how the story was half telling you about the world and half showing you a story. The story itself felt really small, but all the conspiracy theories and figuring out what was happening to the crew lent to most of the book. But I’m glad they did it so the second book can be pure story about a robot named Murderbot venturing out on his own.\n\nI also loved that it’s through Murderbot’s POV so there are parts you miss because he’s offline and you know deeply into his inner thoughts. And because he’s a robot and has the intelligence of the world, he’s able to deduce situations and make guesses that work and keep the crew safe. It was sad what happened to it and what eventually happens at the end, but you're not sad for long. It's most definitely a hopeful introduction to a character I most definitely want to follow.\n\nOverall, great start to a great series and I can't believe it took me this long to get into it. Now, if only I can find space on my TBR to read the rest.\n2021\n \n2023\n \nbooks-i-recommend\n \n...more\n24 likes\nLike\nComment"}

GOOD. Go read it. So I can haz more people to talk to about it! (My goals are all ultimately selfish.)\n\nOkay, okay, I’ll add a little more while still keeping it spoiler-free and mysterious (oooo ahhhh). This is a rare novella that is *just* the right length. I’ve read the occasional short story that’s perfectly brief and plenty of novels with word counts perfectly suited to their stories. But in my experience, almost all novellas leave me wanting more. More background, more plot, more character depth. More story. All Systems Red manages to tell a complete story in novella length that is actually satisfying.\n\nSo I lied a little about the not wanting more. But the *more* I want is the right kind. The story wraps up and is whole and complete. I just want more Murderbot!\n\n(Lucky for me, there are three more published books in the series and another unpublished book on the horizon).\n\nNOW I’m wrapping this up. Go forth and experience Murderbot for yourself. I’ll be at the bookstore buying the rest of the series while you do that.\n\n(Last last thing - I just want to give Murderbot a hug, except that’s awful, since it would hate that. Silly human me.)\n\nI received a free finished copy of the book from Tor Books, the publisher.

Earning a solid 4.5 ⭐️ rating thanks to the aforementioned narrative, this novella is an extremely economically efficient, sharp-punching-black-eye-shining gem in the world of speculative fiction, science fiction, space opera & to be honest, fiction full-stop.

However, the protagonist here — Murderbot — is not your typical SecUnit, thanks to some — very cleverly designed — software flaws that remove his inability to use free-will. With a wry sense of humor, introspective tendencies, and a secret desire for freedom, Murderbot truly transcends the typical, monotonous robot archetype to develop into a loveably intelligent, moving & deeply relatable character. It is through Murderbot's narrative voice that we explore themes of identity, autonomy, and the blurred lines between human and machine.\n\nThe novella's pacing is close to impeccable. Wells keeps the tension riotously taut, using concise prose that effortlessly carries the reader through the story. The action sequences are adrenaline-fueled, but what truly sets \"All Systems Red\" apart is its ability to balance intense moments with moments of quiet reflection. Murderbot's internal struggles and musings on the nature of freedom add depth to the story, elevating it beyond a mere action-packed adventure.\n\nThe world-building in \"All Systems Red\" is another standout aspect. The author crafts a richly detailed future where corporate interests clash with the desire for knowledge and exploration.

And I really liked it! This was fresh, fun, and clever. This has to be the most fun read I’ve had all year! Be ready for some laughs if you decide to pick up this short novella, the first in an award-winning series.\n\nMeet Murderbot. He’s a cyborg construct designed as a security unit whose job is to protect humans. However, this particular Murderbot has highjacked his governor module which is the apparatus that makes him follow orders. Now in his independence, he can download hours and hours of entertainment so that he can watch soap operas all day and not do his job or care about doing his job.\n\nAs a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nThis machine made of a combination of metal and organic components is such a fresh, new creation. He’s cynical and hilarious. He does his job reluctantly trying to keep the expeditionary team alive so that they can complete a survey on a remote planet. As you might think, things go wrong from the beginning and don’t seem to let up. There is quite a bit of excitement packed into this swiftly-paced story which is told completely from Murderbot’s point of view.\n\nIt’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.\n\nThe sense of urgency just wasn’t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don’t care.\n\n…but you may have noticed that when I do care, I’m a pessimist.\n\nWhen his group of scientists realize he is more than he claims to be, they begin to treat him as one of them. It creates some very socially awkward and touching moments in the novella because this is not how Murderbot is used to being treated. Murderbot has a great personality despite his pessimism, social awkwardness, and sarcasm. I highly recommend this and can’t wait to read on in the series.\n\n\nI hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon\n\nGranted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\n2024-reads\n \n52-book-challenge-2024\n \nfound-family\n \n...more\n25 likes\n10 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I find A.I.’s to be one of the coolest characters in sci-fi stories (so much possibilities), and Murderbot is a great addition to the club. Murdering people is a lot of work; why not watch Netflix instead?\n\nIn this entertaining space adventure, it’s snarky and rogue A.I. (wrapped in a flesh body wearing a suit of armor) steals the show. As a SecUnit Murderbot should take care of this team of humans researching an empty astroid, but it would much rather be left alone and watch episodes of Sailor Moon all day.\nYet when it's humans gets attacked, Murderbot is forced to do what it hates: interact with them.\n\n\"Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into the monster’s mouth.\"\n\nThe plot is straight-forward and the dialogue easy, and combined with the reculant friendship between Murderbot and its humans, this was a charming read.\nYet I could never really understand the world and the technological systems that the bots and people use. They all know how the technology works so there is no need to explain something to us, which lowered my enjoyment of this story.\n\nStill, if Murderbot stays as deadpan and the world-building expands, I would love to continue this series. Snark in space is always good 😁\nscience-fiction\n \nshort-fiction\n18 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I also really liked that there is no sex or gender stereotyping going on in this book. No one is described by their looks, no one is described by prescribed gender norms, possibly because Murderbot is sexless and genderless and is the one telling this story. That was pretty awesome.\nHowever, despite this being a novella, it took me a solid two and a half weeks to read.\nI was a little put off by Murderbot's voice, like I kept trying to figure out why it had such casual, slangy linguistic patterns. Was that from watching all those soaps? Or just because it's so cheaply made? Or because it's not being governed? Or was it a human at one point and that's how it used to talk? That niggled around the back of my head the entire time and distracted me. Also, for whatever reason, this just couldn't hold my attention. I would put it down and seek out other entertainment after about twenty minutes. I have no explanation for that. It might have nothing to do with the story, it may just have been how I was reading this month.\nI don't know.\nI just know that I couldn't read this all in one go and I was distracted by the narrator's voice so I enjoyed this about 3.5 stars worth.\nbffs\n \nfunny\n \nfuture-fiction\n \n...more\n19 likes\n11 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I forgot how much action was packed into this short novella. It is compulsively readable, and manages to develop a great character in the midst of the fighting and mystery.\n\nOur Murderbot is a security cyborg, who has hacked its governor module, thus developing independence, a personality, and an insatiable appetite for entertainment media. It is lazy about its job until things get scary and it needs to protect its humans - even though it is no longer forced to do so. This comes in handy as Murderbot cannot be controlled by evil humans. Its humans develop an affection for it - which results in much awkward contact it rather would not have. Our Murderbot is ready to kill a bunch of invaders - but don’t try to look at its face or worse, talk about how it’s feeling.\n\nUnadulterated fun the second time, too.\n\n—- Original review ——\nThis was a lot of fun.

It wasn't at all how I imagined it but that's probably because, as I realised afterwards, I'd never actually read the blurb, only reviews.\n\n\n‘The hub system that controlled their habitat, that they were dependent on for food, shelter, filtered air and water, was trying to kill them. And in their corner all them had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.’\n\n\nAt just 144 pages, All Systems Red is a short book. It tells the story of an eight person survey team who find themselves in trouble and Murderbot’s attempts to protect them in the days running up to the return of their ship.\n\nThe first paragraph gives a good indication of how the story continues. It reads: 'I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.'\n\nMurderbot (so self-styled but never verbalised) is an artificially-intelligent security unit or SecUnit. (I imagined him as a male but he’s really non-binary/non-human so I will do my best to remember to write ‘it’ instead of ‘he’.) It has little interest in murdering humans, or in humans full stop. It’s shy and doesn’t like to be addressed or looked at; its absolute worst fear is to be asked to discuss its feelings. It’s not all knowing or all capable like many a fictional robot/AI, but it makes the best of what it has and does its damnedest to mitigate the mistakes and shortfalls of their corporate overseer.\n\n\n‘They don’t give Murderbots decent education modules on anything except murdering, and even those are the cheap versions.’\n\n\nAnd yet, for all its supposed aversion to human company, Murderbot comes to develop a soft spot for the scientists it's assigned to protect. I loved its loyalty and its gentleness, its geeky obsessions and its disinterest in menial chores. Put simply, it was adorable and all I wanted to do was wrap it up in a hug. I wouldn’t though; it’d hate that.\n\n\n‘They were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. And I can’t do even a half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans.’\n\n\nIf I were to make one recommendation to the author, it would be to change the cover. As beautiful as it is, I think its dark severity gives the wrong impression. This is a light, happy read with kind characters and a good dose of humour (and rarely gallows humour either). I’d recommend it widely and can’t wait to see where Murderbot goes next.\n\n\n‘Nobody was touching my humans.’\nai\n \naudiobook\n \nfuture\n \n...more\n24 likes\n23 comments\nLike\nComment"}

It's not that it doesn't care - OK, it doesn't for the most part - it's just selective of what it cares about.\n\nThis was absolutely well-written and had a robot protagonist I related with way too much. While I enjoyed Murderbot and his relationship to the human characters, I didn't really care too much about the human characters themselves. There where way too many and the novella just isn't long enough to properly develop each of them, so I really couldn't tell the difference between Volescu, Pin-Lee, or Ratthi. They may reappear down the line and get more defined characteristics, we'll see.\n\nI also didn't find the actual plot very interesting. I think when this story shines is when it's focusing on Murderbot, so I was very glad for the twist at the end. I've never read something like this and, while I didn't love it as much as I wanted to, I'm intrigued to read more in the series.\nfriendship-story\n \nkindle-unlimited\n \nnovella\n \n...more\n18 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is one such unit, on contract with a small group of scientists surveying an alien planet. The thing about Murderbot, though, is that it hacked its original programming so it doesn’t have to follow orders (but, fortunately, is content to still halfheartedly do its job as long as it can spend a minimal amount of time with the clients and can watch soap operas). Then things start to go horribly wrong and Murderbot is forced to pause the soaps and keep the clients alive.\n\nThe story is fast-paced, action-packed, and there’s a bit of mystery element, as the characters are trying to figure out who is behind everything and why. Murderbot’s wit, sarcasm, and bluntness also make it really funny. Murderbot reminded me a bit of GLaDOS, albeit less mean.\n\nI enjoyed pretty much everything about it, except that the exact reason behind Murderbot caring about the humans was not developed enough (At first it says dead clients looks bad on its record, and later mentions that if it doesn’t help them off the planet, it would be trapped on the planet waiting for its power cells to die, but Murderbot’s genuinely altruistic behavior betrays these selfish motivations). I also expected the problems to be more... dire. Yes, having unknown assailants out to kill you is a serious problem, but the Murderbot and the crew got themselves out of it too quickly/easily. Lastly, the human characters Murderbot is protecting are mostly indistinguishable and undeveloped. It being a novella accounts for most of these shortcomings, but that also shouldn't be an excuse.\n\n4.5 stars, rounded down, but still really looking forward to the second installment!\naction\n \nepistolary\n \nhumor\n \n...more\n18 likes\nLike\nComment"}

This book was everything. Like, how can I relate so much to a sentient robot? Easy, he comes up with the best inner monologues \"You may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.” . He just wants to be left alone to watch his silly shows and read his books. He has extreme apathy for everyone and everything else, and I had never felt more seen than I did after reading this book.\n\n“And in their corner, all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.”\n\nI cannot wait to continue with this series. Special thanks to my husband, who convinced me to read this after watching the first episode of the TV show adaptation and saying, “I think you should read the book. It seems like you would like it. It reminded me of the one you liked about the octopus.” To say I was shocked he had actually paid attention, and more importantly, remembered, when I told him about Remarkably Bright Creatures and my obsession with Marcellus the Giant Pacific octopus would be an understatement. This is why you should always be with your soulmate.\n2025\n \naudiobook\n \nfavorites\n \n...more\n18 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

A required presence on these missions is one or more SecUnits, a cyborg programmed to keep humans from getting eaten by sandworms or whatever.\n\nThis is the first in a series of four novellas (and a forthcoming novel) about one SecUnit who has surreptitiously hacked its operating system and become a free agent. Mostly this means watching downloaded episodes of a soap opera called Sanctuary Moon and pretending it doesn't care about the human crew on its latest mission.\n\nThis SecUnit calls itself Murderbot, and Murderbot is adorable (I also hate calling Murderbot it, but it/they/Murderbot doesn't have a gender or else then it would be working in the sex trade.)\n\nThis story opens with a bang when an exploratory science team is almost eaten by a graboid--I'm convinced outer space is full of giant killer worms--and Murderbot rushes to the rescue. What follows is a tightly plotted but somehow heartwarming tale of espionage! Murder! Sanctuary Moon!\n\nI really enjoyed this. It was three stars until near the end, when I realized I loved the characters (especially Murderbot) and didn't want it to end. It was funny and smart. And it broke the bad luck streak I've had with Tor novellas (I know this makes me a monster, but I could not get into Every Heart a Doorway or River of Teeth.)\n\nAlso, interesting trivia: the future is polyamorous.\n\nI'll definitely be reading more of these.\nbookmarks\n \nbookriot\n \nbooktube\n \n...more\n17 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I spent half an hour reading reviews today, trying to understand what made everyone love this book. I still don't get it, I'm sorry.\n\nI know why I didn't like it, at least. I just felt no connection. I'm into the whole trope of the sentient AI and honestly, I don't care if everyone's doing it. It's a cool trope. But precisely because it's so common, I need to have something that sets the story apart. And I didn't find that. There were no descriptions of the world or characters, no world-building, the characters, apart from the murderbot, were practically indistinguishable. I didn't care about them, and so I couldn't care about the plot, which was about a super vague threat. I didn't even care about murderbot. Its only human characteristics were some awkwardness and an obsession with entertainment. Both felt forced and repetitive. I get it, it doesn't like taking off its armour and it loves serials. I still don't feel a thing.\nThis review is all over the place by now so to sum it all up: there was no context, no introduction to the world, no real personalities for any of the characters, no strong reasons to make me empathize with the murderbot and the plot was generic.\n17 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I managed to blow through it in a few hours, which is unusual for me. But the pace was so fast and the story so intriguing that I couldn't stop for long without wanting to get back in and find out what happened next.\n\nThe strength of this book is really Murderbot itself. The story is told from its perspective, and it's an interesting one. It's so convinced it's just a machine, continually reminding others, and trying very hard (it seems) to convince itself of that fact. But it has emotions and attachments, little quirks that make it evident that it's not just a robot.\n\nThe pace was so quick, and the story managed to pack a lot of action into relatively few pages. I'm very glad that this is just the first book in a series, though, because the ending was kind of unsatisfying and a little confusing.\n\nI can't wait to find out what happens next in Murderbot's life (and will the poor thing ever get a proper name?).\n\nQuotable moment:\n\n\nI yelled, “No!” which I’m not supposed to do; I’m always supposed to speak respectfully to the clients, even when they’re about to accidentally commit suicide.\nadult\n \nfavorites\n \nnovella\n17 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

And he (I took him as a he since- his liking of inconsequential sit. com. type t.v. fare and action series tipped the scale for me in that direction; yes, I guess that is a prejudicial judgment). He is a SecBot. A security robot. But he does have organic parts.\n\nThe entire story just entertained me to the max. Loved it.\n\nAdored the way he thought, and his self-knowledge concerning his own \"I don't care\" factions, especially those which related to his job performance and obedience % proclivities.\n\nThis truly entices me to read others of hers. Because this author sure knows humans.\n\nOthers speak of our hero's snark. I don't feel like it is snark at all, in fact quite the opposite. He truly doesn't want to be other than what he is and that is not a stand up comic or anything whatsoever that has to be of central focus or individual scrutiny.\n\nSo I thought the ending was superb. Exactly how it should have went and usually doesn't.\n\nEven if you dislike most si. fi. I still highly rec. this one. I just wish it had been longer. Hope there is a Part #2 novella.\n18 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I love sci-fi when the character is a sentient AI, cyborg, robot, etc so this was right up my alley.\n\nFrom the beginning, I was hooked. Murderbot is owned by a company and is sent out as the security bot for a scientific exploration group on a new planet. They are there to determine if they want to buy into the shares for the planet by testing the natural resources available. It's not long before Murderbot is working hard to keep his little herd of scientists safe from someone bent on sabotaging and maybe killing off their stranded group before the date the company comes back to pick them up. Murderbot is fully in command of himself due to a faulty command module and he has to trick everyone into thinking that all systems are normal.\n\nThe wry wit of Murderbot (he did have a mass killing under his belt so why not), his non-human way of looking at things, his addiction and binge-watching of human entertainment vids, and the uncertainty this lethal being has around feelings and acts of goodness from humans who generally treat him like equipment makes for an engaging story.\n\nI found it a great blend of character-driven with action plotting. It was a quick read, but very developed. The stranded with someone out to get them for unknown reasons was a great backdrop to see Murderbot and the isolated scientists interact and learn to work together. I liked that it ended leaving things wide open for what comes next even while wrapping up this first exciting chapter in the story.\n2025-audiobook\n \naudio-books\n \nsci-fi-romance\n17 likes\nLike\nComment"}

And it’s not like any old Murderbot, oh no. By its own admission “as a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nAfter hacking the so-called governor module, the bot becomes independent from external force and is able to pursue its own way of happiness. But it has to do so in secret. The humans, whom the Murderbot was assigned to, must not know about this “rogue SecUnit”, or else it would probably be decommissioned immediately...\n\nAdmittedly, I had a little difficulty finding my way into the story and read the first half with not too much interest, despite some hilarious utterances by the bot. The I realized that reading it as some kind of SciFi Murderbot bildungsroman makes a lot of sense and I followed the rest of its moral development with utter joy, and the final chapter actually put a tear in my eye.\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\nmedia-ebooks\n16 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I usually don’t give out 5 stars to a book as short as this (150 pages), I like big books 😊 , but this one is just too good, it hit all the right buttons for me.\n\nA self-aware security droid that calls itself “Murderbot” is set to protect a team of scientists on a remote planet. It doesn’t really like humans (unless they are on tv) and just wants to be left alone so he can watch an endless hoard of movies and series. But then the mission is under attack and Murderbot is called to come into action.\n\nIt was straight into the action here, and I immediately loved Murderbot, with all its excellent logic, analyzing skills, sarcasm and social incompetence. I literally laughed out loud quite a few times. Murderbot’s character is what makes this book so enjoyable to me, although the story was good too.\n\nThis one was short but sweet, and I can’t wait to read the rest of “The Murderbot Diaries”.\n5-star-books\n \ng-science-fiction\n \nreviewed\n \n...more\n16 likes\nLike\nComment"}

But this particular SecUnit is hiding a secret. It had hacked its governing module nearly four years ago so that its corporate owner could no longer control it. And instead of running away, Murderbot has pretended as though nothing has changed and has continued working for its corporate master.\n\n\nIt’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.\n\n\nNow on what should have been a boring job of safeguarding a crew of scientists has turned into a case of corporate shenanigans. The lives of these scientists, who treat Murderbot as a person instead of as a thing, are in serious jeopardy.\n\n\nAnd in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day. And I could help, just by being the SecUnit. I was the one who was supposed to keep everybody safe.\n\nYou may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist. I hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about \"Sanctuary Moon.\"\n\n\nI have had the All Systems Red on my TBR list for a couple of years. And if it has also been on your list, don't wait as long as I did to get to this. Martha Wells has created a fascinating character that raises questions about artificial intelligence, identity and self-awareness, and mental health that are pertinent to this day. It isn't all just angst as Murderbot's occupation and skills set mean that violent, chaotic action will soon ensue.\n\n\nI have small energy weapons built into both arms, but the one I went for was the big projectile weapon clamped to my back. The hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun.\n4-stars-very-good\n \nfantasy-sci-fi\n \nread-women-2024-challenge\n16 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "bingo-2023", "text": "L (Nineteen Adze)\n384 reviews\n51 followers\nFollow\nAugust 30, 2025\n2025: this was so fun to read again on my third or fourth trip back to this opening volume-- it still may be my favorite of the series. Just what I wanted to unwind at the end of a busy month.\n\nThis time, I had the recent Apple TV adaptation on the brain; I was worried that the artistic choices there would override my own impressions, but it was much less so than I had anticipated. My image of Mensah has moved a bit, but book!Murderbot speaks in longer sentences than the pithy and rapid-fire delivery on the show, so the book's \"accent\" took over most of the time after a few pages of back-and-forth. There's also more dark comedy around the edges in a way that really works for me.\n\nThe show does some things quite well, particularly in the strong falling-action last episode, and gives the human characters a lot more of the emotion that they're doubtless feeling while Murderbot avoids the awkward squishy elements: I'm glad I watched it. But I enjoyed going back to book elements like the degree to which SecUnits are extended equipment pieces and the use of drones or the feed to mitigate eye contact and other intense moments of social interaction. They wouldn't have made for great TV, I'm sure, but to me they're an integral part of how Murderbot moves through the world.\n\nIt's great to realize that I've broken in new comfort reads as an adult, especially those with as many layers as this one. I always feel like I'm noticing some new little detail in Murderbot's tight first-person POV clashing with reality, or some worldbuilding implication that didn't pop until I had the context of later books. The thoughtful construction and strong writing style just keep me coming back.\n//\nA great reread, just as I'd hoped. Possible RTC, but in short: this is so satisfyingly *focused* across the board. It's great as both an open-ended single entry and as the start of a deeper character arc. Above all, Murderbot's voice is distinctive: I'll read a book about almost anything with the right narrator to carry it.\n2025-reads\n \nall-time-favorites\n \nbingo-2023\n \n...more\n16 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The thing is, it kind of doesn’t care much about being a helpful robot and does a lot of his job “half assed”, preferring to watch serials in its free time.

What they know is that data is mysteriously disappearing and they may have been sabotaged from the get go.\n\nI enjoyed this for what was offered. I do not think this is a masterclass in science fiction but it is a good entertaining beginning of a series. It is a short novella so I wasn’t expecting a 5 star read. That being said I wasn’t fully expecting this either…\n\nThis is much more plot based than I expected. most people like to talk about Murderbot’s wit and personifications but I don’t think that was the center of the narrative. Of course I did like its perspective but it wasn’t as much of a comedic standout as it seems to be for everyone.\n\nTaking this all into account I did enjoy this and am I retested to see where the story goes.\n\n---------------------------\nThe Murder Bot Diaries:\n#1 All Systems Red: ★★★\n#2 Artificial Condition: ★★★.25\n#3 Rogue Protocol: ★★.75\n#4 Exit Strategy: ★★★\na-3-stars\n \nb-adult\n \nc-novella\n \n...more\n15 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I likened the murderbot to \nbeing like if Terminator and WALL-E had a baby and while those two movies are wildly different and seem like they have nothing in common, the blending of such opposing concepts here works really well.\n\nIt's an interesting way to approach something like being agender too since there's no preconceived expectations of gender roles for a robot. And his (I use this in a neutral way and because the narrator is male, but whatever pronoun you want to use is just as valid) struggles to understand humanity and his own \"malfunctions\" can be viewed as him being neuro-diverse as well. But while the bot struggled, there was a sense of humor there too that kept the story from veering into drama or becoming maudlin. And the ending was definitely not what I expected \nwith him seeming to have discovered a found family who invited him into their lives but that he rejects to find his own way. It makes me feel like this won't be a predictable series.\n\nLooking forward to more.\n\nKevin R. Free, who I know of from the Welcome to Nightvale podcast, narrates this and I really liked his performance and range of voices. This is my first by him that I've listened to but hopefully not the last.\n3-and-a-half-stars\n \naudiobook\n \nborrowed-library\n \n...more\n16 likes\n6 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Format: audiobook]\nOnce again, I enjoyed this sci-fi novella. Also, listening to the dramatized adaptation was a bonus point this time. Can’t wait to continue the series.\n\n[January 2021; first read. Format: ebook]\nAll Systems Red is the first novella in a sci-fi series and the January pick that Álex, Raquel and I chose for our 2021 Adult SFF Challenge. This is a quick and enjoyable short read that follows Murderbot, a SecUnit—a cyber security unit—assigned to assist a group of scientists on an uninhabited planet. But it has a secret: it has hacked its governor module, which allows it to make its own decisions. Murderbot and the human crew soon discover that someone is trying to sabotage their mission, putting them all in danger.\n\nI really liked how despite what its name suggests, Murderbot is an introvert and sarcastic cyborg that loves spending its time watching soap operas. I found very cute how it says it doesn’t care about the crew when the truth is that it grows fond of them throughout the novella. I also liked the glimpses we get of the world-building and the mystery surrounding the mission.\n\nOverall, All Systems Red is an enjoyable novella full of action and that delves into the importance of finding oneself. That being said, I enjoyed the first half way more than the second one, although the ending left me intrigued enough to read the next novellas in The Murderbot Diaries series.\n\n“You may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.”\n\n\nP.S.: I’m not English, so I’m sorry if there are any spelling or grammar mistakes.\n\nInstagram | Twitter | Youtube | Tumblr\n\nadult\n \nadult-sff-2021-challenge\n \nread-in-2021\n \n...more\n15 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Meaning I've now listened to the Kevin R. Free one, this one, AND the ebook editions.\nAnyhow, I liked this audiobook. I think I'll always be partial to the Kevin R. Free narration, but it is really nice having different voices for all the characters. I love Ratthi's (omg plz let this spelling be right) voice. But how Murderbot is narrated feels so different. Definitely a different feel from more antisocial and annoyed to... hmmm more emotional?\nThe length is about 45 minutes shorter, but since I listen to it on x1 and the regular audiobook on x1.2-1.5 it didn't feel like too much of a difference.\n\nSo, will I continue on with the GraphicAudio editions???? ehhhh I'm at least going to try the next one to see how A.R.T. is voiced. Who knows, maybe it'll grow on me. I really think if I had listened to this one first, I would have liked it more. I'm just used to MB being just 2 steps from destroying everyone and less... friendly and curious haha.\n----------------\nOkay, to be honest I've read this series (books 1-6) twice this year all before I could even get around to writing this review. I listened to books 1-4 as an audiobook first then went back the second time and read them. I don't have a favorite way of reading these books. The narrator does an amazing job and I'd love to one day own these audiobooks. This is a series I want to purchase in every way and at this point has become a comfort read.\n\nI'm not usually a huge fan of sci-fi. While this series does delve into tech wordage, it isn't so much that I can't understand what is being said or at least figure it out.\nThis one has some action to it and introduces us to the characters who are the main reason I love this series. MurderBot is so relateable. The anxiety, how they don't want to deal with people, and watching media while they should be working just make me all the more in love with them because I get it. I'm always nodding my head along. But then an action part will come up and it is almost shocking because I forget they are a SecUnit. This series is just so great.\n2021-books\n \n2022-books\n \n2023-books\n \n...more\n18 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I had very high expectations because of the hype and all the awards and it didn't fully lived up to them, BUT it was GOOD.\n\nSo, I'm giving it 3.6 stars\n\nIf you like character driven stories you may love this book as much as others did. I'm a plot and world reader and I found both lacking.\n\nThe plot was extremely simple. Murderbot is in charge of the security of a \"survey team\" and an unknown entity seems to be hacking their systems, and they seem to be in danger because another survey team like them was murdered. That's it. It's more a mystery than a plot. When the book ends you will still have MANY questions, and the world is one of them. The story is supposed to happen in an alien world that would have been awesome if it had been described and developed, But it wasn't, not even a tiny bit!\n\nHoweeeeeveeeer... I did enjoy it enough to finish it and give it over 3.5 stars! And this is why:\n\nThe MC is really unique and entertaining!\n\nThe story is told in first person POV from the Murderbot's perspective who just happened to become a \"free agent\" AI (Artificial Intelligence) , meaning not subject to commands from its masters anymore (Who are its \"masters\"?? That's the question! lol). It's definitely a thought-provoking experience to be in the mind of a self-aware genderless Artificial Intelligence as he experience and questions what means to be human-life in his relationship with the other characters. So there are thoughts of sexuality, gender identification, human motivations, etc. etc. etc.\n\nAnd well, I really want to know who the heck is messing up with them, and who wants to kill them, and I want to learn about this world. So I will likely read book 2!\n1-own-ebook\n \nread-ai-virtual-consciousness-virtu\n \nread-what-means-to-be-human\n15 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

If anything, it was the kind of story you should read when you don’t take yourself too seriously. It’s a fun little gem with a hilarious premise, but besides that, I don’t think it’s for everyone.\n\nThe story is very technical, and to believe whatever Murderbot says, you’ll have to forget everything you’ve ever learned about science. There is a lack of explanation regarding the technology used, and the story is concentrated very much on Murderbot and nothing else, which is understandable because it’s very hard to build a world in just over one hundred pages. As a visual reader who loves description, I found myself filling in the gaps with my own imagination, rather than by the words of the author.\n\nBut that didn’t matter much to me. Regardless of the cons, the story was entertaining, fun, action packed and fast-paced.

Hence, Murderbot — although our Murderbot has disabled the system that they think caused them to do that, and manages to take pretty good care of its little group of prospectors while also mainlining a ton of soaps and whatever other entertainment programs come its way.\n\nI found it all very entertaining, but there was a more serious aspect, too: the Murderbot’s misanthropic attitude and even anxiety about interacting with humans, especially without its suit and opaque helmet on as a buffer. Thus the interactions with the team were a little sad as well as funny — if not sad, perhaps the right term would be invested with pathos, especially as they interact more and more with their employers (contractors? not sure quite what the term should be).\n\nI was a little disappointed by the ending, leaving behind the established team. Obviously there’s gonna be more Murderbot, but… with a new cast otherwise? Boo. I was just getting to like ’em.\n\nReviewed for The Bibliophibian.\nrobots\n \nshort-stories-novellas\n \nspeculative-fiction\n15 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

This will be a short one due to the length of the book. With that said, I want to thank you all who are supporting the Youtube channel. It really means a lot. Lets dive right in.\n\nCharacter development: 2/5\nok so the main character here is Murderbot, and as a robot there's not much development to be had. This book focused on his emotional developments and within that, I think there was a lot he improved in.\n\nWorld building: 4/5\nThe world felt vast, with different biomes and fauna corresponding to different places. I did not feel the world limited in any regard.\n\nPlot: 5/5\nOk so for being such a short book, the whole plot was Murderbot surviving a tough situation. I enjoyed how the author wrote his character out and I think given the length of this ook, it was executed superbly.\n\nEnjoyment: 5/5\nGenuinely I enjoyed all of this book. I read it in a day and had a blast while reading it. I think Murderbot is sarcastic in the best possible way.\n\nThanks again for watching/reading friends. I'll see you on the next one!\n16 likes\nLike\nComment"}

A solid 4.5 Stars for this read.\nIt is impossible not to like Murderbot, she (well, it should be 'it' as it is sexless, but halfway through page 1 I had it pegged as her) has a delightful personality, full of self consciousness and selfishness built around her role as, basically a security guard on a planetary scan job.\nHer first interactions with her clients, who see SECUnits, as they are known by, as property, are awkward for all and lead to some interesting dialogue and of course opens up a huge story opportunity in the 'AI's have feelings too' arena.\n\nVery short book. Quick to read, I did it all in one evening as I was engrossed in it and decided that my Friday night gaming was going to take a break so I could finish it. Going straight into book 2, but I am also going to have a whinge about pricing. Book 2 is $12.95 on Kobo and Amazon here in Australia.

The next few quotes pretty much sum up this opening novella. I feel the world building was a little too spare but there was some great entertainment to be had in these pages. I'm definitely looking forward to reading on.\n\nThis is why I didn't want to come. I've got four perfectly good humans here and I didn't want them to get killed by whatever took out DeltFall. It's not like I cared about them personally, but it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.\n\nThe HubSystem that controlled their habitat, that they were dependent on for food, shelter, filtered air, and water, was trying to kill them. And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\n\n\"I do think of it as a person.

Certainly there were allusions to self-replicating bureaucracy but is something more fundamental, a crucible of autonomy. It was this Cartesian mind-body dilemma which distracted me from the numbing monologue. I fear this author makes Andy Weir look like Flaubert. The mot juste of the Murderbot might reflect some futurist fantasy but the prose by which it is plumbed has all the resonance of a Reddit thread.\nspeculativelyspeaking\n14 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I read Murderbot.\n____________________________________\n\nRe-read 2022 & 2023 Update: All-Time Favorite.\n\nI have nothing else to add other than that Murderbot is the best.\n____________________________________\n\nI COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nRating: Absolutely Loved It (potential for all-time favorite rating for sure)\n\nHow could I NOT fall in love with Murderbot with an opening like that???\n\nShould I be concerned with how much I relate to a human-robot construct who sees their sole purpose for existence to murder? Probably. Am I really that concerned? NO!\n\nPoor Murderbot just wants to be left alone to consume their various forms of media in peace, and the humans in their charge just keep narrowly escaping death and then trying to do weird and annoying things like TALK to them about FEELINGS. BUT WHY!? I felt like Murderbot and I could be the same person at times: the social anxiety, the extreme introvertedness, the cynical and sarcastic inner monologue. This is the most I have related to a main character since House in the Cerulean Sea. I swear some of Murderbot's lines were things I have expressed to friends at one time or another.\n\nOkay, done gushing, I will try to move to a more cohesive review mind now. Novellas are really hit or miss for me, so I was somewhat apprehensive going into this one. The world building and the characters other than Murderbot are not super well defined, but I didn't find that it took away from the story.

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nRating: Absolutely Loved It (potential for all-time favorite rating for sure)\n\nHow could I NOT fall in love with Murderbot with an opening like that???\n\nShould I be concerned with how much I relate to a human-robot construct who sees their sole purpose for existence to murder? Probably. Am I really that concerned? NO!\n\nPoor Murderbot just wants to be left alone to consume their various forms of media in peace, and the humans in their charge just keep narrowly escaping death and then trying to do weird and annoying things like TALK to them about FEELINGS. BUT WHY!? I felt like Murderbot and I could be the same person at times: the social anxiety, the extreme introvertedness, the cynical and sarcastic inner monologue. This is the most I have related to a main character since House in the Cerulean Sea. I swear some of Murderbot's lines were things I have expressed to friends at one time or another.\n\nOkay, done gushing, I will try to move to a more cohesive review mind now. Novellas are really hit or miss for me, so I was somewhat apprehensive going into this one. The world building and the characters other than Murderbot are not super well defined, but I didn't find that it took away from the story.

{"username": "", "date": "2018-03-31", "text": "Lukasz\n1,824 reviews\n461 followers\nFollow\nMarch 31, 2018\nIt's been ages since I've read a sci-fi novel. And I have nothing against the genre. Somehow, though, I rarely pick sci-fi books. Time to change it.\n\nAll Systems Red has an interesting premise - On a distant planet, a team of scientists is conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself as “Murderbot.”\n\nDespite this name, there's not much mayhem in the book. Actually, Murderbot is mostly interested in binge-watching shows on entertainment feeds. Fates of fictional characters are more important to it than the fates of scientist team she's supposed to protect.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems there's sort of a sabotage and lives are at stakes. Murderbot will have to make few important decisions.\n\nThe story is told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot. It seems people tend to enjoy her snarky narration. Personally, I couldn't connect to her / its voice. There's a serious lack of character and character development. The team of scientists is barely sketched, at times it's difficult to keep track of different characters as most of them have absolutely no personality.\n\n\n“Confession time: I don’t actually know where we are. We have, or are supposed to have, a complete satellite map of the planet in the survey package. That was how the humans decided where to do their assessments. I hadn’t looked at the maps yet and I’d barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we’d been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn’t had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn’t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don’t care.\n\n\nAs you see Murderbot doesn't care much about her team and isn't interested in nuances of their behavior. As a result, we don't learn about it. Think of them as chess pieces. Mostly pawns.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting novella but because I couldn't connect to Murderbot's voice, my enjoyment was limited.\nsci-fi\n14 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I can only echo that it's worth checking out. The genre is a mix of sci-fi, dystopian, mystery, and dry humor.\n\nThe hook of the story is that it's told from the POV of murderbot, an AI that is programmed only to kill and is sold from mission to mission but has other ideas and would rather watch entertainment shows and be left alone.\n\nThe plot of the story is more about this murderbot and a small crew of people coming together to solve a mystery. The humans are nervous and suspicious of murderbot because...well, it's a killer with no humanity and the murderbot is nervous to be around humans because they're humans. The murderbot functions like someone with social anxiety which is both interesting and amusing.\n\nI enjoyed the story but the ending felt a little abrupt.\n\nThe story contains no romance but humans are in polyamorous relationships. The bot also does not have a gender. The cast is diverse and included people of Asian and Indian descent.\n\nCurrently, this is on Scribd as a three hour audiobook.\n\n\n\n100-150-pages\n \naction\n \nartificial-intelligence\n \n...more\n14 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

An obviously sentient A.I. being ordered about = slavery in my mind. That’s why I always side with the A.I. in SF stories where it isn’t 100% clear that the A.I. is an evil monster trying to murder humanity. So it’s really easy to side with Murderbot, the media loving security in the story. It’s just a novella so there isn’t a whole lot of character development aside from Murderbots, but there is plenty of action and a thoughtful plot, along with a likeable human cast of characters. I’ll be reading more in this series once they are released. Many thanks to Alice for her glowing review which lead me to read this.\n\n\n**edit reread I wanted to read this again as I've decided to finish the series and it's been a few years since I first read it.

Murderbot Diaries is one and after reading the first novella, I am hooked. I am very much into robots/androids/human/ai hybrid stories, especially when the character is a good one. All Systems Red starts out fast and has a good combination of action and smart interaction. The main character is a human/robot construct who has hacked their own programming module so they are secretly free but still acting the part of a security unit so that the company does not deactivate them and disassemble them for parts. The character is observant, fiercely independent, and endearing. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator, Kevin R. Free, is a cool and calm voice, a perfect vibe for Murderbot.\n14 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I also found that there was hardly any world building.\n\nIf you generally enjoy short novellas than you may enjoy this book because it seems similar to the same style as other popular novellas, they just aren't usually for me.

We have a rogue murderbot who hacks into its own governor module to better protect its human clients. It uses its freedom not to wreak havoc but to do the bare minimum at work and binge-watch series. This book made me stop fearing a future with sentient machines. More on that on my blog.\nfavourites\n15 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-12-22", "text": "Filip\n499 reviews\n55 followers\nFollow\nApril 14, 2021\nI've updated this with some more thoughts in my video review: https://youtu.be/i15hCf4woqs\n\nWell worth seeing!\n------------------------------\nOriginal review:\n\nThis review originally appeared over at Booknest.eu!\n\nCopy borrowed from my local library. Support libraries, folks!\n\nWhile browsing through the rows of books in English in the Swedish library I frequent, I came across Martha Wells’ All Systems Red, a novella whose cover I dimly recalled seeing years before on Tor.com. I looked through my To-Read list and – surprise! – this one was nowhere near it…as if that would stop me. I grabbed it, stole away Ada Palmer’s Too Like the Lightning as well, in case someone thought this thin novella too conspicuous. Long live sci-fi!\n\nBy the end of the night, I’d read through the first of these titles with barely any effort.\n\nAll Systems Red offers a fun story from the point of view of an anxiety-riddled robot with several biological components and a touch of misanthropy: “I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other”. This SecUnit calls itself Murderbot and seeks to avoid all direct interactions with its human wards, interested only in watching the tv, music and game programmes on entertainment channels. If this isn’t enough to make the Murderbot relatable, I don’t know what will.\n\nStuck on a planet with a band of scientists performing geological studies, our protagonist hopes to avoid any sort of excitement; unfortunately for him, this is a sci-fi novella intent on putting Murderbot on the spot and testing its mettle! A few action scenes are only to be expected – and they were well handled and entertaining.\n\nThe prose is serviceable – not quite excellent, but it doesn’t need to be. There’s plenty of great interactions, the dialogue never tends towards the heavily expositional and the personalities of all the scientists, led by team leader Mensah, shined through. Oh, and the humour? Golden: “Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.”\n\nIn terms of antagonists, the architects behind our protagonist’s woes don’t make for anything especially memorable; they’re rather archetypal, presenting rather the depths to which human greed tends to go when a group of people goes off the deep end. It works well and keeps our SecUnit and his group of scientists on their toes and pushing themselves as hard as they can to survive.\n\nOnce embroiled in a crisis, Murderbot is willing to put its life on the line for the band of humans it has been tasked with protecting – despite it hacking its governance module. The same module that allows anyone who’s signed a deal with the Company – like the scientists – to command Murderbot. By working to save Mensah and the rest of her team from a shadowy enemy, then, Murderbot is exercising its free will – and this is at the heart of what’s examined in Wells’ novel. The question is one of freedom and compassion and examination of the self, and the text goes a long way in showing how Murderbot exercises all three.\n\nMy score for All Systems Red is a 4/5. This is a legitimately enjoyable adventure in a science fiction setting with plenty of good zingers and a socially awkward Robocop – what’s not to love?! I’m looking forward to reading more about Murderbot in the future! I’ll definitely be picking up his story when I’m next in my local library!\n2017\n \nnovella\n \nsci-fi\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "I almost really liked this book.\n\nRight off the bat, it was clear Murderbot's personality was what will keep the reader engaged, and it mostly managed to do that. The first chapter is hilarious, and the depiction of Murderbot as the incarnation of that voice in our head that says: \"I wish everyone would die and leave me alone, but I can't deal with that so I'll just watch TV instead\" is spot on, and is relatable in a wonderfully morbid way.\n\nTrouble comes on three fronts: one, Murderbot has a story arc that doesn't make sense. Two, everything besides Murderbot is completely uninteresting. Three, the writing is... strange.\n\nThe first: Murderbot was a wonderfully intriguing character at the beginning, but that was because it seemed like it truly was a depressed killing machine. Very quickly it turns out that it cares tremendously about human beings and would readily risk its life to save strangers.\nAnother point is the ending, which comes out of nowhere: \nafter telling us for the entire book that it wants nothing other than to be left alone and watch TV, it suddenly decides to become independent and travel to an unknown destination, saying how it wants to be free and not follow anyone.\n\nThe second: the story and characters are significantly lacking. The plot is the most generic possible, the characters are (almost) all flat. It partly works because this is how Murderbot sees the world, as it doesn't pay much attention to people. But I, the reader, do care. Many choices and actions make little sense, the antagonists are behind the scenes for the entire book until they appear for five minutes and are quickly dealt with (in a way that doesn't make sense). We are told about the characters' relationship status (a loner with a crush, a lesbian couple, one in a four way marriage, one in a three way marriage, etc), but are told nothing else about their lives. Murderbot claims to not care at all about sex, but that's the only thing it tells us about its coworkers.\n\nThe third: the writing style is strange to me (it might be more about me than the book, as I'm not a native english speaker).\nThe descriptions sometimes fail to take into account things the author knows but the reader doesn't. For example: Murderbot attacks two enemies, describing how it took them by surprise and shot them until they stopped moving. Then it describes where and how much it got shot itself. Then it describes how just before the fight had started, it sent a few miniature drones to crash against the enemies. What's with the strange order of events? It made me imagine how the scene went, then forced me to change it a moment later. Most of the action scenes in the book are weirdly described.\nThis appears in several other places too, where the author apparently lost track of what the reader knows and doesn't know, and it made for an uncomfortable reading.\n\nOne additional point, this time about the genre: the sci-fi elements are severely underutilized and unexplored, which feels like a waste.

Image sourced from Amazon.\n\nThe sense of urgency just wasn’t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don’t care.\n...\nMensah looked around at them. “Does anyone want to turn back?” I did, but I didn’t get a vote.\n...\nIt’s not like I cared about them personally, but it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.\n...\nAnd in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\n...\nI was also planning to use the time to watch some Sanctuary Moon and recharge my ability to cope with humans at close quarters without losing my mind.\n...\nGranted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\n\nDespite the breakthrough success of Martha Wells' Murderbot Diaries series I had previously no interest or FOMO attraction to looking into it. From the title I had assumed it was about an android assassin or hitman, and even the books with a human protagonist of that sort can get pretty dull and repetitive.\n\nBut then I saw the opening episode of the AppleTV+ series and realized that the protagonist was instead more of a bodyguard character, despite giving itself the weird self-identification moniker of \"Murderbot.\" So anyway, this was a \"free\" read on Kindle Unlimited and I took a chance on it.\n\nI ended up enjoying it quite a bit, mostly due to what seemed to me to be the character's neurodivergent characteristics, some of which you can read in the selected quotes above. He would more often than not prefer to be left alone and indulge in OCD behaviour of video watching. He is intimidated by direct eye contact and/or by people looking at him. Longtime interactions with groups of people are stressful and require recovery time, etc.\n\nI'm more likely to follow through with the TV-series than the later books, but I came out on the plus side with this one.\n\nTrivia and Links\nAll Systems Red has been adapted for the Apple TV+ original series Murderbot starring Alexander Skarsgård as the title character. It premiered on May 16, 2025. You can watch the trailer for the series on YouTube here.\n\nI investigated creating an Alternate Cover Edition (ACE) for the current TV-tie-in edition but then discovered that the Goodreads Librarian Manual says that ACEs are not allowed for Kindle or Audible Audio. I don't really understand why but there it is. So that is why I embedded the latest cover image into my review.\n2025-kindle-unlimited\n \n2025-reading-challenges\n \ncomedy-fiction\n \n...more\n14 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I guarantee I would have done a much better job.”\n\nAll Systems Red is a wild ride that expertly balances humor, action, and a profound exploration of identity—all wrapped up in the experiences of a sarcastic, self-aware murderbot. Seriously, how can you resist that premise?\n\nFrom the moment I met Murderbot, I was hooked. This character is not just another robot; it’s a being wrestling with its purpose and autonomy, and let’s be honest, its binge-watching habits. Wells has created a narrator who is equal parts charming and relatable, making it impossible not to root for it—even when it tries to avoid the very humans it’s meant to protect. If you’ve ever felt like you’re just trying to navigate life while wanting to curl up on the couch with your favorite show, you’ll see a bit of yourself in Murderbot.\n\nThe pacing is spot on, propelling you through the story with a rhythm that keeps you engaged. Just when you think you understand the flow, the action ramps up, pulling you right back in. The world-building is so seamless that you feel like you could step into it and join Murderbot and its crew on their adventures.\n\nWhat really blew me away is how Wells tackles complex themes about agency and connection while keeping it completely entertaining. This isn’t just a sci-fi adventure; it’s a thought-provoking journey that challenges you to think about what it means to be truly alive.\n\nThis novella is a perfect blend of humor and heart, leaving you with a smile and a sense of connection. It’s a quick read that not only entertains but also resonates, reminding us that even in a world filled with technology, the search for identity and belonging is timeless.\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. I was also still doing my job, on a new contract, and hoping Dr. Volescu and Dr. Bharadwaj finished their survey soon so we could get back to the habitat and I could watch episode 397 of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon.\n\nHow can you not be intrigued by this entertainment loving security droid who calls itself Murderbot? Comedy, consciousness, autonomy, and privacy play a key role in this vivid outer space drama centering around a human/robot hybrid. Murderbot gets nervous, often doesn't care, and when it does manage to care, it's a pessimist.\n\nWhat's not to love? Other than, like all short stories, it left me wanting more. Absolutely cannot wait to read the rest of the series. There are three more books coming out this year, Artificial Condition (The Murderbot Diaries, #2), Rogue Protocol (The Murderbot Diaries, #3), and Exit Strategy (The Murderbot Diaries, #4).\n\nYes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\n2018\n \nspace-related\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

It follows a SecUnit (who calls himself Murderbot) protecting a crew while they explore a planet. Along the way he encounters danger, tolerates humans, and shares his witty point of view. The novella is engaging, funny and action packed. As Murderbot slowly starts to reveal he in a sentient A.I. he describes the strangeness of human social interactions. Through his eyes the nature of the crew's mission unravels, with suspense, as they face danger and threats no one was prepared for.\n\n\n\"The humans hadn’t gotten a lot of sleep last night, from the crowding and the strong possibility of dying.\"\n\nThe pacing, story and plot flowed together effortlessly. You will quickly become immersed with Murderbot who is not human,  but has a soft spot for them. In a short amount of pages I cared about the characters and enjoyed the simply explained sci-fi elemenst. In this future where humans are not constrained to their planet, I was happy to see diverse characters included. I really wanted more of everything, but had to reminded myself there will be more books. I will be continuing on with the series and hope it maintains its great momentum.\n\n\n\"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\"\n\nRecommended for Readers who\n- enjoy funny action packed stories\n- want a quick entertaining read\n- want to cheer for a socially awkward sentient robot\nfavorite\n \nhumor\n \nsci-fi\n13 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Set in a universe where space travel is a regular occurrence and scientific expeditions to far flung planets are sold to the lowest bidder its fairly common for things to go wrong but on their latest mission things are about to get very difficult for our narrator, the part organic / part robot Muderbot.\n\nAll intergalactic expeditions must take along a company supplied security unit, ostensibly to protect the humans but equally used to report back any interesting scientific findings. Murderbot is the SecUnit for a team of scientists, one of two groups currently working on a previously unexplored planet. Well aware of their previous failures Murderbot can't afford to make any mistakes on this latest mission, they just need to keep their head down, get the job done and then they'll be free to spend all their time watching the entertainment feed. After a series of strange equipment malfunctions they end up completely losing contact with the other group on planet, a sure sign that something isn't right. Murderbot has to do whatever it takes to keep the humans alive but that may be easier said than done considering they have no idea who the enemy is.\n\nThis was a really fun novella to read, Murderbot is such an interesting character with a snarky sense of humour and a definite dislike of having to interact with the people they're supposed to protect. All Systems Red may be a novella but Martha Wells packs a lot in, the combination of humour and action makes this a very quick and easy read and it definitely left me wanting to see more of Murderbot and the rest of the crew.\nbooks-i-own-kindle\n \nbooks-in-audible-plus\n \nread-in-2018\n \n...more\n14 likes\n5 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Φυσικά το βιβλίο αυτό αποτελεί την πρώτη μου επαφή με τη συγγραφέα, μιας και είναι μόλις το πρώτο της που μεταφράζεται στα ελληνικά (πολύ ευχάριστη έκπληξη από τις εκδόσεις Φανταστικός Κόσμος). Οφείλω να πω ότι συμπάθησα πάρα, μα πάρα πολύ το γκρινιάρικο Ανδροειδές Ασφαλείας που αφηγείται σε πρώτο πρόσωπο την όλη ιστορία, και μου άρεσε που η συγγραφέας διάλεξε έναν τέτοιο παράξενο αφηγητή και πρωταγωνιστή, αν μη τι άλλο έδωσε το κάτι διαφορετικό στο είδος. Εντάξει, μιας και πρόκειται για νουβέλα δεν έχουμε κάποια φοβερά περίπλοκη ιστορία, και οι χαρακτήρες είναι μάλλον μονοδιάστατοι (εκτός ίσως από το πρωταγωνιστικό Φονομπότ), όμως περιέχει δράση, αγωνία, ωραία σκηνικά και μια εξαιρετική ατμόσφαιρα, ενώ διαβάζεται πολύ γρήγορα και ευχάριστα. Και, ναι, άνετα διαβάζεται σαν αυτοτελής ιστορία, αλλά φυσικά το τέλος είναι ανοικτό σε επόμενες περιπέτειες του Φονομπότ, που ελπίζω να δούμε στα ελληνικά. Οι λάτρεις της επιστημονικής φαντασίας πιστεύω ότι θα περάσουν καλά διαβάζοντας τη συγκεκριμένη νουβέλα.\nsci-fi\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is fun and hilarious and sarcastic and contradicts themselves and their behavior all the time, they're a killing machine, but they just don't do it and instead watch entertainment videos and love being alone and it's so realistic and refreshing and they're also so very socially awkward and get uncomfortable when humans give them attention and do social human things when they would rather just watch entertainment videos and not talk all day and that's just so weirdly really really really relatable and I love it so much and enjoy it so much. It's so comforting to read about and feels validating and so homey and so comforting.\n\nI CAN'T WAIT TO READ MORE!!

Стилът ми е твърде улеснен/опростен. Замяната на един богат речник с няколко повтарящи се технологични термина не е равностойна замяна.\nСтава за краткотраен ескейпизъм, ако това търсите.

I had a lot of fun with this. We follow Murderbot- a biological construct who is part robot, part cloned biological material- who has overwritten their control programs. They are serving as a security bot to a group of human researchers on a dangerous planet when things begin to go wrong.\n\nThis is short-form fiction which not everyone likes, but I think Murderbot is a great character and the world development is interesting. I'm definitely left with questions at the end of the story, but I imagine some of those answers will come later in the series.\n\nWhile there is no deep dive into anything, there is some consideration of what makes someone a person and the morality of controlling sentient created beings. This was enjoyable and a very quick read. I will be reading on in the series.\naudible-library\n \ntor-tordotcom\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I've heard nothing but positive things about the Murderbot series. I found that they were mostly true. My only criticism is more to do with my own expectations than the actual book. For some reason, I expected more humor in the story. There is some humor but it's mostly a serious action/adventure story. The humor is only sprinkled throughout the story in the deadpan and sarcastic narration provided by Murderbot's POV. I still liked it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi. Especially those like me who enjoy mostly adventure and character-focused science fiction.\nAlso, the narrator for the audiobook did a great job :)\naudiobook\n \nscience-fiction\n \nshort-story-or-novella\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2022-01-07", "text": "Kyle\n439 reviews\n625 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 7, 2022\nActual rating: 3.5 (rounded down)\n\nI love Murderbot. That’s it.\nThat’s the review.\n\nActually, I guess I should explain why I didn’t rate this higher. That’s only fair.\n\nAll System’s Red is a breezy science fiction/adventure romp that follows a self-hacked security robot (cyborg?), who privately goes by the name “Murderbot”—a name which is explained partway through the story— as it accompanies eight human surveyors on a distant planet. Things go awry when they lose communication with a neighboring survey outlet.\n\nAs I mentioned, this is a quick read. It’s a novella, after all, and only the first in a series with Murderbot. And as much as I adore this shy creature that simply wants to watch entertainment serials all day long, and have nothing do with its human counterparts, I felt the story just needed a bit more fleshing-out. It wasn’t as packed with action as I’d anticipated. I think I was expecting something more akin to Sci-Fi/horror, honestly, so that was my own fault. Alien, this is not.\n\nRegardless, it was still fun. All the characters are a nice blend, and I’m assuming get more depth as the series progresses? I don’t know. I was simply expecting it to be much darker than it turned out to be. I can’t really complain, though, because the Murderbot’s sarcasm won me over. It’s difficult not to fall head-over-heels with the character. That’s why I think it holds appeal with so many. I count myself among them.\nsf-fantasy\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "best-2020", "text": "Bertie (LuminosityLibrary)\n560 reviews\n123 followers\nFollow\nJune 29, 2020\n'All Systems Red' was such an amazing, fun book. I love Murderbot so much. There's such a relatable humour to it, and it's so loveable. I listened to this book as an audiobook, and although I usually prefer reading, it was great to listen to. It's the perfect novella in my eyes.\n\nI'm going to keep this review relatively short because I wasn't able to make notes. Murderbot is a security robot hired to look after a team of scientists as they survey a planet. It's hacked its governor module and so is technically free to do as it likes, which mostly consists of watching a lot of TV. When the team realise that their planetary data is hijacked to hide information about dangerous wildlife they need to figure out who's responsible, and why.\n\n\nAll they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\n\n\n\nThe highlight of this book is Murderbot itself. It has such a fantastic narrative voice, and that's coming from someone who usually prefers third-person narratives. There's an amazing sense of humour to it that's both dry and relatable. Murderbot doesn't like talking to people. It's incredibly awkward. I love a socially anxious robot. At one point it's asked if it's okay and it gets up to stand in the corner of the room in embarrassment. I love it.\n\n\nYes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\n\n\nI also love that Murderbot is a sentient and empathetic character without needing to be human. There's an awareness that it's a different type of individual, that it doesn't necessarily want what humans want. It seems like that's going to be explored in the next novel which I'm excited about.\n\n\nIt’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do.\n\n\nAlso! Although the background cast isn't hugely developed, likely because Murderbot doesn't care too much about human information, they are amazingly diverse. You've got a cast full of people of colour, a W/W relationship and causal mentions to polyamory. I always love a sci-fi setting where bigotry doesn't seem to be an important factor.\n\n\nYou may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.\n\n\nI'm looking forward to the next in the series because it'd be great to see how Murderbot further develops, as well as get more information surrounding worldbuilding through its eyes.\nbest-2020\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Matabot es una SegUnidad autohackeada. Su misión es proteger a los humanos que contratan los servicios de la aseguradora a la que pertenece, aunque en realidad prefiere ver telenovelas y tener que interactuar lo menos posible con los humanos. En su misión actual se encarga de un grupito de científicos que no le dan muchos problemas, pero todo se le complica cuando alguien o algo intenta sabotear la misión de los científicos y eliminarlos.\nSe acabó la tranquilidad para Matabot, que tendrá que esperar para seguir con El santuario de la luna\n\n2.-Los personajes. Aquí el que importa es Matabot, esa especie de bot, humanoide asexuado con armadura y componentes orgánicos. Es sarcástico, cínico, tímido y un apasionado de las series. Y sí, será un bot o lo que sea, pero tiene sentimientos.\nDespués están los demás, los científicos, quienes quitando a Mensah son simples nombres. Son totalmente planos y no tienen desarrollo alguno.\n\n3.-La pluma, la trama y demás. Es un libro muy corto dividido en 8 capítulos. De hecho, es tan corto que le faltan explicaciones y mucha acción. Los conflictos se resuelven de manera brusca y precipitada, sin un desarrollo detallado. Vamos, que es el típico libro al que le faltan paginas para que la historia te deja completamente satisfecho.\nLa pluma no es rebuscada pero le falta fluidez, y también le falta desarrollo y ahondar más en el mundo de \"Matabot\".\nOtra cosa buena que tiene es que se lee super rápido, pero eso se debe a lo corto que es.\n\n4.-El final. Bien. Cerrado en cuento a la trama de este primer tomo y abierto en cuanto al futuro de Matabot. Me gustó, porque nos deja con ganas de seguir las aventuras del personaje, sin saber realmente que será lo siguiente que hará.\n\nEn fin, 3 estrellas sobre 5 porque me hubiera gustado que fuera un libro más largo y con más desarrollo.\n\n**Popsugar 2021 categoría 18.

I really enjoyed All Systems Red. Murderbot is essentially an anti-social robot hybrid that likes to binge watch television shows, I really connected with it. Murderbot has been created to guard crews and scientific expeditions on different planets by an entity called The Company. The Company is kind of cheap when it comes to the quality of the products they supply. Their fee isn't cheap, but they don't deliver top-notch supplies. Murderbot knows this.\nMurderbot has also disabled its Governor Module which means it's not like the other Sec Units. Murderbot has control of its own actions, but this secret can't get out.\nMurderbot surprised me. It had character. Most times, I didn't think of it as a robot hybrid, but instead a flesh and blood human. I'm still a little confused as to what Murderbot actually is components wise. I don't know how to categorize Murderbot in my mind. I want to call it a she, but I don't know. It was a lot of fun following Murderbot. Murderbot is the main character in this story. I honestly have a hard time remembering the human crew, or even how many of them there were.\nAll Systems Red was such a quick, little book. I flew through it. It's a novella and they always tend to leave me a little wanting. Just when I'm really getting into the story, or really attached, it's over. I feel a sense of loss. I wish I had more of it.\nI really enjoyed the action in this, the mystery. It was very dangerous and exciting.\nIt just went by too quick. I blinked and it was over. The ending left me on a note of wanting more. I need to know what happens next with Murderbot. I'm definitely going to read the other books in the series because I need to know things.

NEVER!!!)\n395 reviews\n185 followers\nFollow\nApril 19, 2018\nThe Murderbot Diaries and The Princess Diaries are different books, capiche?\n\n\n\n\nSoooo, you meet this Murderbot who likes TV shows. She is a bit like Glados from Portal (sister from another mister, I assume). Her lifes were pretty miserable, so she learned to hack a bit. And now she is on a mission with some humans. And she doesn't care about most of the stuff. Living la vida loca in some distant planet, chilling with TV shows. But as we know, stuff happens. And the shit storm comes.\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that didn't work with me was style. I think this book would have worked better as a book, not a novella. The length worked against the author, since I would have loved deeper background exploration, more character revelation. Now everything was skipped past in a speed of light, making everybody boring or chaotic. I think the goal of this book was to introduce Murderbot, and I think it failed a little. I had very little idea who she was and why she behaved in the ways she behaved - and I had very little understanding of what made her unique as a bot. I also would have loved to know more about crew - not it was just The Lady Boss and The Grumpy Guy. Also, the conflict was too shallow to really wow the reader as novellas have a very short time to make the impact and they have to make it big.

However, I was drawn to this story because the premise looked intriguing and, as a huge fan of GraphicAudio, multicast performances, I noticed that all of the GA audioplays of this series are available through Hoopla.\n\nI went into this story with no preconceptions about the main character, and I was absolutely riveted by the self-named Murderbot, a highly sympathetic, sentient AI robot, which looks human on the outside, other than having no genitals, and is referred to with the pronoun, \"it.\" The GA production of this riveting, action-adventure tale is fantastic. The sensitive portrayal of Murderbot, who shares many of the characteristics of a neurodivergent human, by the talented actor, David Cui Cui, is absolutely brilliant.\n\nI think it says a great deal about the talent of this author, and the genius of GA productions in general, that this story could win over someone like me, who is not at all its intended audience. On the other hand, I understand that jaded SF fans absolutely adore this series as well, so MW has obviously cast a wide net of readers looking for an exciting read.\n\nReread 11/30/24: I just listened for the second time to the GA production of this novel today, and I loved it just as much as the first time.\n\nReread 7/16/25: This is my third experience of this novel and I love it just as much.\nandroid\n \nartificial-intelligence\n \naudio-drama\n \n...more\n12 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"}

El prota es inteligente, intimidante, valiente, pero también es egoísta, irónico, malhablado y muchas veces maleducado, y eso lo hace muy entretenido.\nSin embargo, el resto de los personajes no son tan carismáticos ni interesantes, por lo que no logré conectar ni interesarme por nadie mas.\nAsí que si, me gusto muchísimo, me divertí leyendo los comentarios de Matabot, y es seguro que mas adelante lea otros libros de esta serie.\npaginas-2024\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Until things go very very wrong.\n\nThe story is told from 1st person pov of Murderbot, who refers to itself as it. It hacked its governor control, so it has a free will and it chooses to spend its free time reading books and watch tv serials. Has there ever been more relatable bot? Murderbot is cranky, pessimistic and it has the whole \"leave-me-alone-you-weird-humans-I-want-to-watch-shows-in-peace\" attitude. It doesn't have any gender or sex-related organs, it clarifies it in next for the reader. I love the feeling like it was telling me the story. Its pov was hilarious to read.\nI love Murderbot, don't fight me on it.\n\nThe plot has mystery elements, action and suspense. The tech side of the setting was interesting. I can't wait to see more of the world and my beloved Murderbot in next installments.\nI laughed so much on Murderbot's constant jabs at the company and what a cheap asshats they are, as big corporations always are.\n\nI love the supporting cast of characters. It's a bunch of diverse individuals, many people of color, at least two of them are confirmed to be in polyamorous relationship. It's normalized in the world the story takes place in. The leader of the research team is Dr Mensah, woman of color; she's such a capable leader, she's smart and caring. I hope we'll get to see her in the next installments. The rest of the crew are Ratthi, Pin-Lee, Arada, Gurathin, Volescu and Bharadwaj. The dynamic between the team and Murderbot was so well developed, I love the dynamics!\n\nWhen I read novellas, I often want them to be a full-length novels. While I don't mind a full novel about Murderbot (@ Martha Wells, pretty please!), All Systems Red works perfectly as a novella, I wouldn't change a thing about it. And that last sentence of the book ended me, no kidding.\n\nI highly recommend to read it!\nI can't wait to read the sequel!!!\n\nCW: a bit of body horror, violence\n2017-releases\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2020-read", "text": "Sahitya\n1,177 reviews\n248 followers\nFollow\nFebruary 20, 2020\nIt’s more of a 3.5 because it’s quite short.\n\nI’ve been trying to get into more sci-fi this year, so choosing novellas is a logical choice to ease me into the genre. And choosing this particular one was also easy because I’ve heard a lot of good things about it and it’s also a Hugo winner. I don’t know what I was expecting going into it, but I didn’t expect to be delighted so much.\n\nI won’t deny that the first half of this book was more fun, with the main character Murderbot being all sardonic and pessimistic, just wanting to be left alone to watch tv shows. It was so much fun watching it trying so hard to learn how to interact with humans. I mean, the whole dichotomy of a shy introverted tv obsessed Murderbot is hilarious and I’m totally here for it. The author does a wonderful job setting up the main character as well as the group of human scientists it has to interact with. I thought their conversations were equal parts awkward and endearing. The plot itself isn’t very significant here, because it’s mostly about the setup of the character and a bit of the world.\n\nTo conclude, I’m already half in love with Murderbot and can’t wait to read the next novella whenever I get it from the library. If you wanna try out the sci-fi genre and are looking for some fun easy to read books, this book is perfect for you. But I sincerely can’t say what hardcore sci-fi readers would feel about it. It’s definitely short, sweet and entertaining, so pick it up if that sounds interesting to you.\n2020-read\n \nfantasy-and-scifi\n11 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

This one was pretty accessible. I did have a tough time here and there with the terminology and understanding why the crew was doing certain things. But overall, it was fairly straightforward. The selling point for this series is the narrator, who calls themself “Murderbot.”\n\n“Murderbot” was not only funny and interesting but also very relatable for me, personally. I think that if a boring human character had told this story, it wouldn’t have been nearly as fun. I also found that most of the other characters sort of blended together and had the same voice. Since everything is told from “Murderbot’s” perspective though, that may have been on purpose.\n\nI read this on Kindle Unlimited and I’m going to continue on to the second book!\n11 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2021-12-22", "text": "Jackson\n325 reviews\n98 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 31, 2021\nUPDATE: I have now read this book twice and listened to the audiobook once as well, and after three goes through I can safely say that this is a fantastic book. I still agree with everything from my review - despite thinking slightly more of the story now, so I will not be changing or updating it and the review still reflects my thoughts and opinion after just one read.\n_____________\n\nI feel rather conflicted about All Systems Red. It had a lot of potential, and I certainly enjoyed it, but I felt it also missed the mark slightly in places.\n\nSpoiler-free synopsis:\nA research team has landed on a not-yet-inhabited planet to survey and collect data on soil composition and mineral deposits.\nWith the team is a SecUnit; a sentient, half biotic/half organic hybrid bodyguard. These units are standard issue and it is through the eyes of this SecUnit, who refers to itself as Murderbot, that the story is told.\nWhen another survey teams communications drop out and portions of the digital maps they were given start to go missing, Murderbots's research team realises that something is very wrong and that there may be a conspiracy surrounding the planet and possibly corruption in the political systems that put them there.\n\nIt seemed to me that this could have been a decent short story, or a great novel of a longer length. As it was, it hung somewhere in the middle.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, but there were elements of the story that I thought we could have had less of, and other elements that I wish we had seen more of.\nI guess I will find out if book 2, 'Artificial Condition', contains more of the latter. I hope so.\n\nThe combination of story and perspective was very interesting. So much of what was going on was filtered through the lense of our sentient SecUnit.\nHer feelings, attitude, prejudices, technological abilities, background, origin and her past experiences all lead to a very cohesive and well realised view point, which is rare in my experience with books that try to do similar. This is an incredibly unique protagonist that despite who they are, will be very relatable to many.\n\nI wish the human characters had been given a bit more page time, or at least had been made more separable to each other.\nI found myself regularly getting confused between who is who and which ones played which role in the team.\nAlthough, thinking about it now, I suppose that this helped us gain more of a footing as an outsider. Hiding behind the opaque face mask, full body armour, pretending not to care about anything but the job at hand.\n\nAs for how the story developed I thought the pacing was a bit staggered or clunky. There was a lot of talking and making plans - which is fine, but then suddenly the action and consequences had seemingly happened within another page or two! And due to the nature of said actions (keeping it spoiler-free) we rarely saw the aftermath either.\nIt made sense, but it could be a bit jarring and I couldn't help but wish we had seen a bit more of that stuff.\n\nAs for the last few chapters and the conclusion of the story, I REALLY enjoyed it.\nIt was wrapped up really well, and it left me wanting to start the next book straight away, despite my somewhat mixed feelings on the book as a whole.\n\nI can completely see why this book/series is so popular, but I could also understand if this book wasn't for you.\nIf you have read and enjoyed either the Imperial Radch series by Ann Leckie,'Excession' by Iain M. Banks or 'Dogs of War' by Adrian Tchaikovsky then I think this book would be for you. Likewise if you enjoy(ed) All Systems Red then I would recommend checking these others out as well.\n\n3.5 stars, rounded up for potential.\n\n________________\n\nThank you for reading my review!\n\nAs I said before, I will definitely be reading the other books in the series at some point. So keep your eyes peeled for those coming in the near future.\n\nUp next for though, for sci-fi, it's going to be Surface Detail by Iain M. Banks.\nAnd as for fantasy it's going to be Elantris by Brandon Sanderson.\nTwo books that I've been looking forward to a lot, by two of my favourite authors!\n\nThanks again. Stay safe and keeping reading!\n2020\n \n2021\n \nrereads\n12 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Practic, avem o mașină de ucis care își petrece tot timpul urmărind tot felul de surse de divertisment și încercând din răsputeri să evite contactul cu oamenii.\nPovestea în sine este scurtă și simplă: o echipă de cercetare studiază suprafața unei planete îndepărtate, descoperă că o echipă vecină a fost ucisă și trebuie să găsească o cale să supraviețuiască unui inamic necunoscut. Personajele umane sunt vag conturate, nu au foarte multă personalitate, dar sunt, per total, ok.\nFaima seriei lui Wells se datorează, mai mult sau mai puțin, în întregime personalității lui Murderbot, care narează toată povestea, presărând-o cu numeroase comentarii sarcastice. Există și câteva observații mai profunde, privind ce înseamnă să fii om și drepturile unor viitoare forme de inteligență artificială, dar nimic ieșit din comun.\nPrin urmare, este acest protagonist inedit suficient să țină în picioare o poveste science-fiction generică, cu personaje banale? Răspunsul este da, categoric da. Nuvela merită citită doar pentru Murderbot și, datorită lui, voi citi cel puțin și următorul volum— dacă nu chiar toată seria.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish review: Over time, there have been numerous robots of various types: killers, friendly companions, impersonal, cold, etc. R2D2 and C3P0, Commander Data, Marvin the Paranoid Android, Ultron, Terminator, or Wall-E are just a few examples that come to mind, showcasing the wide variety of artificial intelligences. Well, for the first time, I’ve seen (or rather, read about) something new—a robot with social anxiety, which is the defining trait of Martha Wells' character.\nMurderbot is a security unit that hacks its own governor module, gaining the freedom to do whatever it wants without following the orders of its clients. And what does it choose to do with its newfound autonomy? Spend thousands of hours watching movies and TV shows. Essentially, it’s a killing machine that spends all its time consuming entertainment and trying its hardest to avoid interacting with humans.\nThe story itself is short and simple: a research team is studying the surface of a distant planet, discovers that a neighboring team has been killed, and must find a way to survive an unknown enemy. The human characters are lightly sketched, lacking much personality, but they’re generally fine.\nThe popularity of Wells’ series is due almost entirely to the personality of Murderbot, who narrates the entire story with plenty of sarcastic commentary. There are also a few deeper reflections on what it means to be human and the rights of future artificial intelligences, but nothing groundbreaking.\nSo, is this unique protagonist enough to support a generic sci-fi story with bland characters? The answer is yes, absolutely yes. The novella is worth reading for Murderbot alone, and thanks to it, I’ll definitely read at least the next installment—if not the entire series.\n\nQuote:\n\n\"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It was well over 35,000 hour or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\"", "text": "Andrei Stoian\nAuthor \n3 books\n43 followers\nFollow\nDecember 14, 2024\n\n\nRomanian review: De-a lungul timpului, au existat numeroși roboți, de diverse tipuri: ucigași, prietenoși, impersonali, reci etc. R2D2 și C3P0, Comandantul Data, Marvin androidul paranoic, Ultron, Terminator sau Wall-E sunt doar primele exemple care îmi vin în minte și care reflectă această varietate de inteligență artificială.

Există și câteva observații mai profunde, privind ce înseamnă să fii om și drepturile unor viitoare forme de inteligență artificială, dar nimic ieșit din comun.\nPrin urmare, este acest protagonist inedit suficient să țină în picioare o poveste science-fiction generică, cu personaje banale? Răspunsul este da, categoric da. Nuvela merită citită doar pentru Murderbot și, datorită lui, voi citi cel puțin și următorul volum— dacă nu chiar toată seria.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish review: Over time, there have been numerous robots of various types: killers, friendly companions, impersonal, cold, etc. R2D2 and C3P0, Commander Data, Marvin the Paranoid Android, Ultron, Terminator, or Wall-E are just a few examples that come to mind, showcasing the wide variety of artificial intelligences. Well, for the first time, I’ve seen (or rather, read about) something new—a robot with social anxiety, which is the defining trait of Martha Wells' character.\nMurderbot is a security unit that hacks its own governor module, gaining the freedom to do whatever it wants without following the orders of its clients. And what does it choose to do with its newfound autonomy? Spend thousands of hours watching movies and TV shows. Essentially, it’s a killing machine that spends all its time consuming entertainment and trying its hardest to avoid interacting with humans.\nThe story itself is short and simple: a research team is studying the surface of a distant planet, discovers that a neighboring team has been killed, and must find a way to survive an unknown enemy. The human characters are lightly sketched, lacking much personality, but they’re generally fine.\nThe popularity of Wells’ series is due almost entirely to the personality of Murderbot, who narrates the entire story with plenty of sarcastic commentary. There are also a few deeper reflections on what it means to be human and the rights of future artificial intelligences, but nothing groundbreaking.\nSo, is this unique protagonist enough to support a generic sci-fi story with bland characters? The answer is yes, absolutely yes. The novella is worth reading for Murderbot alone, and thanks to it, I’ll definitely read at least the next installment—if not the entire series.\n\nQuote:\n\n\"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It was well over 35,000 hour or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\"\n\n\n21st-century\n \namerican\n \nscience-fiction\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I wanted to explore some anomalies I’d noticed through the feed.” He gestured to me. “This unit was already a rogue. It has a hacked governor module.”\n\nOn the entertainment feed, this is what they call an “oh shit” moment.\n\nThrough the security cams, I watched them be confused, but not alarmed, not yet.\n\nPin-Lee, who had apparently just been digging around in my local system, folded her arms. Her expression was sharp and skeptical. “I find that difficult to believe.” She didn’t add “you asshole” but it was in her voice. She didn’t like anybody questioning her expertise.\n\n“It doesn’t have to follow our commands; there is no control over its behavior,” Gurathin said, getting impatient. He didn’t like anybody questioning his expertise either, but he didn’t show it like Pin-Lee did. “I showed Volescu my evaluations and he agrees with me.”\n\nI had a moment to feel betrayed, which was stupid. Volescu was my client, and I’d saved his life because that was my job, not because I liked him. But then Volescu said, “I don’t agree with you.”\n\n“The governor module is working, then?” Mensah asked, frowning at all of them.\n\n“No, it’s definitely hacked,” Volescu explained. When he wasn’t being attacked by giant fauna, he was a pretty calm guy. “The governor’s connection to the rest of the SecUnit’s system is partially severed. It can transmit commands, but can’t enforce them or control behavior or apply punishment. But I think the fact that the Unit has been acting to preserve our lives, to take care of us, while it was a free agent, gives us even more reason to trust it.”\n\nOkay, so I did like him.\n\nGurathin insisted, “We’ve been sabotaged since we got here. The missing hazard report, the missing map sections. The SecUnit must be part of that. It’s acting for the company, they don’t want this planet surveyed for whatever reason. This is what must have happened to DeltFall.”\n\nRatthi had been waiting for a moment to lunge in and interrupt. “Something odd is definitely going on. There were only three SecUnits for DeltFall in their specs, but there were five units in their habitat. Someone is sabotaging us, but I don’t think our SecUnit is part of it.”\n\nWith finality, Bharadwaj said, “Volescu and Ratthi are right. If the company did order the SecUnit to kill us, we would all be dead.”\n\nOverse sounded mad. “It told us about the combat module, it told us to kill it. Why the hell would it do that if it wanted to hurt us?”\n\nI liked her, too. And even though being part of this conversation was the last thing I wanted to do, it was time to speak for myself.\n\nI kept my eyes closed, watching them through the security camera, because that was easier. I made myself say, “The company isn’t trying to kill you.”\n\nThat startled them. Gurathin started to speak, and Pin-Lee shushed him. Mensah stepped forward, watching me with a worried expression. She was standing near me, with Gurathin and the others gathered in a loose circle around her. Bharadwaj was farthest back, sitting in a chair. Mensah said, “SecUnit, how do you know that?”\n\nEven through the camera, this was hard. I tried to pretend I was back in my cubicle. “Because if the company wanted to sabotage you, they would have poisoned your supplies using the recycling systems. The company is more likely to kill you by accident.”\n\nThere was a moment while they all thought about how easy it would have been for the company to sabotage its own environmental settings. Ratthi began, “But surely that would—”\n\nGurathin’s expression was stiffer than usual. “This Unit has killed people before, people it was charged with protecting. It killed fifty-seven members of a mining operation.”\n\nWhat I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.\n\n\n3 1/2 stars\naction\n \ncrime\n \nhumor\n \n...more\n26 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I wouldn't have picked this one on my own because this is sci fi and I don't like those kind of stories much. But after having read lately a long string of mediocre books, I let myself be lured to this Murderbot universe by my BR friends (thank you Ele, Linda and Teal).\nMurderbot is an unusual character with an unique voice, which I love, and living in an interesting universe, different from anything I had read about, in part because I'm new to sci fi worlds. I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot or the world the characters are into because I think it's better if you discover it by yourself, but I highly recommend this story.\nbooks\n \nbuddy-reads\n \nfavorites\n \n...more\n11 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Things are going pretty well; it just stands there pretending to monitor the scientists as they obtain samples. Really its watching its favorite space opera, Sanctuary Moon (it has over 35,000 hours of entertainment to consume) so its just as surprised as anyone when a creature explodes from the planetary surface and tries to eat one of the humans its supposed to be protecting.\nSecUnit saves the human (more than slightly annoyed that its space opera has been interrupted) and heads to the habitat to recharge. There, the humans realize that the group of scientists at another habitat located on this planet are not responding to signals.\nWhile SecUnit wants nothing more than to kick back and continue Sanctuary Moon, it knows it has to play along so the humans won’t realize it has hacked its own governor module and is making its own choices, so it suggests tagging along to check out the quiet habitat.\nReaders along for the ride learn that SecUnit identifies as Murderbot. Murderbot has a past and … feelings? The android is annoyed to find that the scientists are beginning to treat it like a person. Then comes the realization that someone is trying to kill them, creating an even more annoying development.\n\nI was surprised by how much I enjoyed this novella! Murderbot is intelligent, sarcastic, and a total badass. All Systems Red is an exciting introduction to Murderbot and has a lot to say about the complexities of human relationships while giving readers a government conspiracy that is sure to unfold along with Murderbot’s back story in the next installment!\n\nFor more reviews, visit www.rootsandreads.wordpress.com\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "I really enjoyed this novella which introduced the fantastic Murderbot character. The premise is that in the future (200 years? I don't think it is ever fully specified), corporations rule the galaxy (or an arm of it, also not clearly stated) and as they pillage and terraform various planets, moons, and asteroids, they employ SecUnits (potent, lethal military android used for, well, murder by corporate unities in the story) rather than private security to protect their interests. This is particularly the case in a zone called the Corporate Rim. Our protagonist has removed the governor which basically gives it free will and we are inside its head listening as it \"wakes up\". It learns about human behavior by watching soap operas obsessively, sometimes providing an excellent comic background.\nOur hero makes friends with Dr Mensah from an ecological mission, and this character plays an important role in subsequent stories as one of Murderbot's best friends.\nWhat makes the story so entertaining is that (1) Murderbot has a hilarious and deprecating sense of humor, (2) the story has a great murder mystery at the center of it, and (3) the powers of Murderbot to multi-process, hook into nearly any tech around it, and get healed after catastrophic injuries all makes for fun reading.\nSo, for light and highly entertaining soft science fiction, All Systems Red is a great novella.", "text": "Michael Finocchiaro\nAuthor \n3 books\n6,258 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 10, 2023\nI really enjoyed this novella which introduced the fantastic Murderbot character.

This is particularly the case in a zone called the Corporate Rim. Our protagonist has removed the governor which basically gives it free will and we are inside its head listening as it \"wakes up\". It learns about human behavior by watching soap operas obsessively, sometimes providing an excellent comic background.\nOur hero makes friends with Dr Mensah from an ecological mission, and this character plays an important role in subsequent stories as one of Murderbot's best friends.\nWhat makes the story so entertaining is that (1) Murderbot has a hilarious and deprecating sense of humor, (2) the story has a great murder mystery at the center of it, and (3) the powers of Murderbot to multi-process, hook into nearly any tech around it, and get healed after catastrophic injuries all makes for fun reading.\nSo, for light and highly entertaining soft science fiction, All Systems Red is a great novella.\namerican-21st-c\n \nfiction\n \nnovellas\n \n...more\n22 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Really quite excellent, actually. It would've rated higher, but it was short and left me wanting more whereas a 5-star book leaves me feeling sated.\n\nBased on the title I thought this was going to be a violent SF horror novel, but it's misleading. A cyborg SecUnit who thinks of himself as \"Murderbot\" is rented out as security detail to a team of human scientists doing planetary research. Unlike millions of other SecUnits, this one is complicated, smart and individualistic - things that Units aren't supposed to be. As the situation on the planet becomes dangerous and the SecUnit shows himself to be trustworthy, his clients grow attached to him. And although he's programmed to be impersonal, he grows fond of them in a distant, confused way.\n\nThe best part of this book is seeing how the SecUnit fights against emotions he doesn't understand and doesn't want to understand. Although I enjoyed the skulduggery elements too (I have thus far neglected to mention the major storyline involving sabotage, murder and bribery), it was the brilliantly written SecUnit's struggle with his unnatural feelings of humanity that pushed this book from good to great and nearly perfect. I just wish it had been longer and shared more of SecUnit's background.\n4-stars\n \nfavorite-authors\n \ng-sci-fi\n \n...more\n10 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Their crippling, nigh-autistic social anxiety at dealing with people made my heart twinge – basically Murderbot is SO SWEET and is my favourite and they must be protected at all costs.\n\nIt’s also an interesting world, and I loved the worldbuilding about the soulless corporations and how they rent out equipment to surveying teams, and the ramifications of their constantly cutting corners. I think the only thing is that I would have liked even more information/exposition about this universe; e.g. there’s a point where a crucial detail is revealed, but because you don’t know anything about the planet-nations in this world, you don’t really know what that entails. Basically, gimme fully-fledged novels in this setting and I am so down.\n\nIt’s a great lil action-thriller, and I’m excited to read the next one!\nartificial-intelligence\n \nfuturistic\n \nhugo-awards-2018\n \n...more\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I’ve only read a few novellas before, and all of them were companion pieces to bigger series. So this was a new experience for me, and I enjoyed it!\n\nMurderbot is an extremely relatable character. I definitely didn’t expect to be connecting over social anxiety with a robot programmed for murder. This book was funny, the world was interesting, and the plot was tight.\n\nI don’t really have any complaints? I didn’t get to spend enough time with the other characters to get much more than a surface level connection with them, but their presences were enjoyable. It was surprisingly wholesome at times, actually, seeing them interact with Murderbot.\n\nI’ll definitely be continuing this series, and maybe I’ll give this a rating someday, but I just don’t know I would give this a certain amount of stars when comparing it to other things I’ve read.\n11 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I was not disappointed – it really lived up to the hype.\nThe characters were so well developed – especially the Murderbot – and the storyline was fast paced and kept you guessing. Some reviewers found that the ending did not follow on from the rest of the tale – but I thought it fitted perfectly, as well as setting things up for sequels (which I intend to read).\nThere are similarities to 7 of 9 from Star Trek – a cyborg coming to terms with its humanity. And also questions as to what makes a human, what makes a slave, and how does how we treat servants reflect on our own moral compass – or lack of it.\nA much deeper book than the overt scifi story would suggest.\nHighly recommended – to anyone who has not yet had the pleasure of reading this gem.\n\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}

This group of novice surveyors/ scientists from a group known as PreservationAux had bought a commission from the corporation to scope out the planet’s resources. Once the survey was completed, if the effort was worth the profit they would get a larger share.\n\nAssisting and guarding them in this mission is the security unit, which refers to itself as the Murderbot. Part and parcel of the contract from the company, along with the habitats, hub systems, hoppers, and everything necessary to sustain life on the unknown planet.\n\nThe SecUnit which calls itself Murderbot, was involved in a previous accident, where faulty implants from the company had malfunctioned; resulting in it slaughtering every person in the vicinity. While a terrible legal & PR nightmare, the Secunit was far too valuable to be scrapped, and so the company rebooted it, loaded new programs, as well as new governor modules the main function of which was to make sure that the Murderbot was never capable of inflicting harm on the humans that were its charges.\n\nUnknown to the company, the survey group or anyone for that matter, this particular SecUnit had managed to hack into its governor module, giving it a level of independence. More importantly, no longer leaving it tethered with the failsafe protocols to protect the humans. What does our murderbot do with this new found freedom? Does it go about a second round of manslaughter? Or does it run away into the wide cosmos to unfettered freedom?\n\nNeither, it downloads several terabytes worth of entertainment programs, binge watching it during its idle time, in speeds incomprehensive to mere human minds. For the most part it is content to perform its assigned job, protect the humans, watch its serials and make sure to act like an obedient automaton so as not to draw unneeded attention to its unique condition.\n\nWhich is proving to be more difficult than it thought, as the humans which are under its protection are being subject to dangerous situations on a constant basis. Now Murderbot has to make a decision; does it continue to feign ignorance, leaving the humans to their fate; Or help them live, thereby exposing his condition to scrutiny and possible termination?\n\n\nThoughts\n\nMurderbot has quite a personality; even when it might not come across as likable/ comprehensive to others, it sticks to its own nature and makes decisions based on a complex mix of indifference and neutral altruism.\n\nMurderbot, contrary to what it calls itself, doesn’t hold any animosity to humans. If you want to categorize its feelings, it would be something like being ‘Lawful Neutral’. It takes care of the humans because they are its responsibility. But, technically, since it has hacked the Governor module, it has no compulsion to carry out said duty. It does regardless, because it has a sense of responsibility.\n\nMurderbot is pretty indifferent to humans, and doesn’t want to get close to them, or interact with them to any degree. This group from PreservationAux, largely leave him to his own devices, and unlike other humans don’t exploit him, or treat him like a slave. They give him space, and a modicum of respect. This makes them appreciable to the murderbot. And while it doesn’t care what happens to them, because it likes how they treat it, Murderbot does everything in their power to make sure they stay alive.\n\nIt is even possessive when it comes to the survey group. When it learns of Rogue altered SpecUnits and a rival group of humans who were antagonistic to their own, it is indignant that the EvilCorp as it calls them, would dare to hurt ‘his humans’. Even when it says it doesn’t care for the humans, Murderbot has shown capability for more complex if not contrary emotions. This is also made evident on multiple occasions, when it jeopardizes its own safety, to ensure the survival of the humans.\n\nMurderbot rarely behaves in a manner that you would expect someone in its position to behave. Even during the climax, when the crisis has been averted, and the humans are delivered to safety, it makes decisions which are right for it, not that the humans feel are right for it.\n\nIt has been a while since I’ve enjoyed a Synthetic character this much, since Marvin & his clinical depression from ‘The Hitchhiker’s guide to the Galaxy’. Not that I’m saying Murderbot is better than Marvin, that is a position which shall remain uncontested. But the range of emotions which Murderbot exhibits, and the spark of individuality which fuels much of its decisions are a breath of fresh air.\n\n\n\n\nThe story is simple, and focused on a series of events of limited scope, in some unexplored hunk of dirt out in the universe. With the exception of Murderbot, we don’t get into more than surface level interactions with the other humans in the Preservation Aux Survey team. The one who is most developed is Dr. Mensah, and that too due to her close interactions with Murderbot.\n\nShe is its most favorite human, and we can't help but be slightly influenced by that notion as well. A natural leader, she has great empathy, and is willing to treat Murderbot with respect, and as an equal, even before she learned of its condition.\n\nBut perhaps when that wish for altruism crossed over to her trying to dictate Murderbot’s life & future, that is when it cuts off all ties and vanishes to the wind. It is perhaps because, regardless of her good intention, Mensah and the others failed to understand that Murderbot didn’t want to be helped, or want to be treated like a human. Just to be left to its own devices.\n\nThe rising actions and setup of the story is surface level, and ends far too abruptly. Perhaps because, from the start, the focus was meant to be on the personality & inner thoughts of Murderbot, our protagonist.\n\nFor a short story, and a surprisingly quick read, All Systems red, manages to explore the psyche of our unique and interesting character, without being too heavy handed or exposition heavy. That is a great accomplishment for the writer, and I look forward to reading the other entries in the series.\n2022-reading-list\n \nfantasy\n \nnovella\n \n...more\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Yeah that sounds about right actually 😂\n\nOk, so. I know that it's fairly safe to assume that us sff readers are, on average, more likely to be introverted when compared to the average person and so I can't help but feel that the Murderbot character has a bit of a pandering quality to them, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't still love them. I actually nose-exhale-laughed (is there an actual term for that?) at the part where Murderbot declares that they would rather care about fictional characters than real people because I'd actually said the exact same thing to a friend just weeks ago.\n\nInsert joke here about how I relate more to a robot than to humans etc. etc. Har har\n\n\n\n\nThis story is a satirical but (unfortunately) not entirely ridiculous take on what human civilisation may look like a few hundred/thousand years from now and I am definitely a fan. It knows when to take itself seriously and when not to, and I appreciated that balance. It was a fun read and a great introduction to the universe of this series, starting off with a fairly small scope that I assume will be expanded in the future novellas, can't wait to read more!\nkindle\n \nmarch-2021-challenge\n10 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I really liked Murderbot's voice, but on the other hand, I was so confused the whole time. Too many systems! I understood nothing! Also, like? It felt very low stakes? Because we know that Murderbot is, well, a murderbot operating outside the control of any bad actors (besides, potentially, himself). So there was never a sense of peril or drama. He was just dryly narrating his extreme competence in a detached and technical way, which: I love most of those things individually -- dryness, competence, and detachment, I mean; technical, I can take or leave -- but in this case the combo, plus the all systems-induced bafflement, kept me from getting properly invested.\n\nCurious to see if I enjoy it more as the series goes on.

Murderbot is the shining star here, so the other characters did fall a little flat for me, but it didn't really effect my enjoyment because of how much I loved Murderbot.\n\nI haven't read a great deal of ScFi but it's a genre I want to get into, this was a nice introduction to the genre, the author didn't exactly hold your hand through this book and build up a world she she throws you in an hopes you can keep up. Although I like a book with immense world building normally, this was a nice change, we go along blindly with Murderbot seeing what he sees and figuring out for ourselves.\n\nFor a short book it packs a real punch and it isn't something I will be forgetting anytime soon. This author is clever to make the robot almost more human than the humans, she makes the reader not on sympathise with him to complete relate to his more anxious side.\n\nI will 100% continue with this series, I hope we get to see Murderbot doing a little more of what his name suggests, I think on a re-read this could be a five-star I just need to learn that books can be under 400 pages long!\n10 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Como él mismo dice al principio del libro,\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nA partir de ahí, solo pasan cosas entretenidas. Nos encariñamos rápidamente con el protagonista y observamos cómo razona y cómo resuelve situaciones y cómo se engancha a las telenovelas y cómo rehúye a los humanos con los que trabaja (es un bot ofrecido por su compañía como parte de un contratro de exploración).\nAl final estamos ante una novela corta de aventuras espaciales, que me ha encantado. Hay cuatro entregas de la serie y la autora trabaja en la quinta para 2020. Muy entretenida. Un úinico fallo, no literario: las cuatro novelas cortas forman una novela larga, pero han decidido venderlas por separado y a precio de novela entera cada una de las cuatro.\n<--actualización-->\nLe he dado una segunda lectura para llegar con todo fresco a la quinta entrega de la serie, y la he disfrutado igual que la primera. Tiene ese estilo (lleno de paréntesis (e incluso paréntesis dentro de paréntesis)) con el que el robot narra que me encanta. Frases del libro que he sacado porque me gustan (posibles mild spoilers):\n\n\nChapter One\nBefore she accepted delivery of me, she had logged about ten protests, trying to get out of having to have me. I didn’t hold it against her. I wouldn’t have wanted me either.\n\nChapter Two\nPart of it is, they didn’t want me here. Not here in their hub, but here on the planet. One of the reasons the bond company requires it, besides slapping more expensive markups on their clients, is that I was recording all their conversations all the time, though I wasn’t monitoring anything I didn’t need to do a half- assed version of my job. But the company would access all those recordings and data mine them for anything they could sell. No, they don’t tell people that. Yes, everyone does know it. No, there’s nothing you can do about it.\n\nChapter Three\nI thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need for DeltFall was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.\n\nChapter Four\nMensah gave everybody watch shifts, including me. This was new, but not unwelcome, as it meant I had blocks of time where I wasn’t supposed to be paying attention and didn’t have to fake it.\n\nShe tapped back an acknowledgment on the feed, and I heard her telling the others to get off my feed and my comm, that she was going to be the only one speaking to me so I wasn’t distracted. Mensah underestimated my ability to ignore humans but I appreciated the thought. Ratthi whispered, “Be careful,” and signed off.\n\nI found their first SecUnit. It was sprawled on its back on the floor, the armor over its chest pierced by something that made a hole approximately ten centimeters wide and a little deeper. We’re hard to kill, but that’ll do it.\n\n\nBecause you can’t walk up to another murderbot with an armor- piercing projectile or energy weapon inside the habitat and not be looked at with suspicion.\n\nChapter Six\nIt’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.\n\nI hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon [una telenovela].\n\nChapter Eight.\naround, a hundred different public feeds brushing my awareness.\n2019\n \n2020\n \nciencia-ficcion\n \n...more\n10 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "listened on audio… YAWN LOL\n\n——————\n\nOriginal Review 6/24/18:\n\nYes, talk to Murderbot about it's feelings.

I didn't hate it, but sometimes the choppy wording and sentences could be a tad awkward and I would have to reread them. But the writing lent itself to letting the story move fast, which I always like.\n\nWhat flopped in this book for me was the plot and the ending. The last two chapters were confusing and vague, and I couldn't tell you what the GrayCris group was trying to accomplish and why Murderbot's group had anything to do with it. It was never explained, and I found the fact that Murderbot was unconcious for a majority of the action scenes to be a tad lazy on the author's part. The last chapter was also weird, I don't understand quite what happened since it seemed like everything important had been completely missed by Murderbot and no one bothered to explain it to them. The last few pages seemed out of character for Murderbot as well, and I have no idea why it ended that way or where it will take us in the future.\n\nI know this is a series with 3 more books, so I'm guessing we'll learn a lot more about that planet they were on, their mission, the GrayCris group, and why everything happened the way it did.

{"username": "", "date": "This was my first experience with Martha Wells and her science fiction Murderbot series. It has an interesting premise, to say the least. The story is told from the point of view from a robot, referred to as security unit. Tis unit has managed to override its governor installed device that directs and controls its actions, which has enabled it to develop a sense of independence and free agency. It has named itself Murderbot, hates being around humans, but yet has a voracious appetite for watching serial television shows.\n\nIn this first novella in the series, “All Systems Red,” Murderbot is part of a corporate (called “The Company) financed scientific expedition on an alien planet. His role is protecting the research scientists because safety isn’t always as good as it could be in uncharted space. Unfortunately. Murderbot discovers information about the local fauna is missing from their survey information, as well as sections missing from their local area mappings. Then things get worse when they lose contact with the other expedition group on the other side of the planet. It’s up to Murderbot and his team of scientists to figure out what is happening before it’s too late.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz for this series, both in favor and against it for various reasons.

I thought about how hard it must be to write in first-person and pull off such a challenging view.\nWells succeeds fairly well with this conceptual approach.\n\nThe mystery plotting and characters were both stronger than average. Although the world building was limited by the novella structure, it was good enough to want me to read the next one in the series.\n\nThings I didn’t really like:\n\nBecause it won a lot of awards, including the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus, to name a few – I was expecting a pretty high level of quality. Although I liked it, I didn’t find myself loving it or being as enamored with it as I was hoping for. I know that sounds a bit subjective, and it is.

Murderbot is a shy, awkward, introvert who spends the majority of it's time watching reality TV (haha while pretending to follow orders from the humans). It's a cyborg with free will who lives in a world where cyborgs are mindless machines completely controlled by corporations. What an interesting concept.\n\nWhen I began reading, I was under the impression that this would be dark, but it was really just cynical and mostly lighthearted. It was more comical than I expected, but I am not disappointed at all because I love Murderbot's character so much! I was so happy for the way Murderbot's story ended. The possibilities for the next book are endless. Overall this book was a fun read! I am sure there are plenty of books that explore a similar concept and are very dark and heart wrenching. I appreciate that this one did something different.\n\nThe reason I initially gave this book 3 stars was due to the lack of a complex plot. It really was straightforward and predictable. Now that I have had time to think about it, I believe the main focus was Muderbot and the exploration of the \"other\" and what it means to be prejudice. This is most likely why the plot was simple. I also appreciate the world building much more now then I did initially. It was more complex and intriguing then I gave it credit for. I honestly can not stop thinking about this novella. I can't wait to read the next one!! I might even change my rating to 4 stars. I think I was so wrapped up in what I thought it was supposed to be that I didn't appreciate it for what it was.\nfavorites\n \nfemale-sff-adult\n \nsci-fi\n \n...more\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "Okay, first, \"Murderbot\" is definitely a misleading sobriquet. The protagonist may apply that nickname to itself, but ironically.

Definitely a person, it is legally equipment. Generally it's rented to clients it doesn't think highly of, by a company it thinks even less of, which as you might imagine has cased it to develop a certain bitter cynicism.

All I knew was that it was about an artificial intelligence or robot called \"Murderbot.\"\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that it is a VERY short book and so it is a very quick read. The basic set up is that the story is told in the first person in the voice of the Murderbot, who is a cyborg (s/he has organic parts but also machinery intertwined in its body, including built in guns in its arms!).\n\nWe begin the book in media res, with the Murderbot watching over its human \"clients\" on a uninhabited planet when suddenly an attack occurs by one of the more violent alien fauna. It's basically non-stop action from then on. The voice of Murderbot is somewhat snarky and there is some interesting description(s) and presentation(s) of the cultural position of cyborgs in society.\n\nOverall, I was unimpressed with All Systems Red. Although the premise is somewhat interesting, I just didn't engage strongly with the main character. I didn't really care that much about what happens to Murderbot at the end of the story, primarily because Murderbot is somewhat cavalier towards its own ongoing existence. If Murderbot doesn't really care if it lives or dies then why should we?\n2018-read\n10 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Tüm Sistemler Çöktü, Katilbot Günlükleri Serisi'nin ilk kitabı. Hugo, Locus ve Nebula ödüllü bir novella. Bu ödülleri görmek bile kitabı alıp okumanız için yeterli olabilir. Ama yetmiyorsa, size kitabı kısaca anlatayım: Katilbot, insan formunda üretilmiş bir robot. Uzay keşif birliklerince güvenliklerini sağlamak üzere farklı bölgelerde görev almak üzere kiralanıyor. Son görevinde aynı gezegende keşif yapan iki ekipten birinde yer alıyor. Diğer grupla tüm irtibatları kopunca ortada bir şeyler döndüğünü fark eden ekip Katilbot'u yanlarına alarak durumu çözmek için gezegenin diğer ucuna gitmeye karar veriyor. Ekip gizemli ve gerilimli olaylara müdahale ederken biz Katilbot'u yakından tanımaya başlıyoruz.\n\nBu kitabı çok sevmemdeki asıl neden olay örgüsünden çok Katilbot'un kişiliği, insanlarla iletişimi ve iç konuşmalarıydı. O kadar harika bir şey ki, okurken gözlerimden kalpler çıkıyordu 😂😍 Katilbot kendi sistemini hacklediği için isterse sistemine gelen emirleri hiçe sayabilecek konumda ama çaktırmamak için bunu yapmıyor. Niye yapsın ki, can sıkıntısından iyidir 🤓 Normal bir GüvBir gibi çalışmaya, gelen emirleri elinden geldiğince (!) uygulamaya devam ediyor. Boş zamanlarında yapmayı en sevdiği şey dizi izlemek. Sistemindeki gereksiz şeyleri silip dizilerine bellek yaratıyor. Gel de bunu sevme! 😂💪\nreviews\n10 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Now officially one of my all-time favourite characters, in quite possibly one of my all-time favourite SciFi series ever. If the next books are just as good as this first one, that is.\n\nYou cannot read this book without loving Murderbot.\nThe self-aware SecUnit who wants to do its job while avoiding as much as possible the humans it must work for. Heaven forbid they should start asking questions and even go so far as wanting to know its feelings! :D\n\n'Yes, talk to the Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.'\n\nMurderbot is AWESOME! A killer main character that anyone will root for. And possibly want as a BFF. I know I would.\n\nBut killer characters aside, this first in The Murderboot Diaries series has everything one would look for in a great SciFi.\nCool technological stuff and an intriguing mystery, nice action and relatable characters, a fascinating premise, entertaining dialogue and delightful humour that's just chef's kiss. I chuckled and even laughed out loud at Murderbot's musings and reactions, as well as at its interactions with its humans.\n\nIn short, All Systems Red is a damn fine read that I absolutely recommend to all SciFi or fantasy fans out there.\nJust give it a try and you can thank me later.\nfavourites\n \nscifi\n10 likes\nLike\nComment"}

SecUnit-s, i.e. security personnel developed by the company as a composite of human and mechanical components, have been attached to them.\nOne team has a SecUnit, that has a LOT of issues. As a result, it has liberated itself out of the control of the company. Despite considering itself as homicidal, it spends all of its empty hours watching entertainment feed.\nThen, some glitches occur, that makes it suspicious.\nAnd then, the other team on the planet stops responding to calls.\nWhat happens thereafter?\nI enjoyed the book, and have decided to pursue the Murderbot Diaries that are going to be published in future.\nI would have enjoyed the book more, if the author had adopted a more hard-boiled voice befitting the Murderbot.\nNevertheless, recommended.

I have no idea how this first ended up on my TBR, but I am so glad it did. It had me at the first sentence:\n\n\n“I COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.”\n\n\nBasically, an autonomous Murderbot could fuck your shit up if it so desired but this one is fresh out of Give A Fucks, and it is a DELIGHT.\n\n\n“They were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. I can’t do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans. ... At least Mensah and Arada had overruled the ones who wanted to talk to me about it. Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency”\n\n\nMurderbot is my spirit animal. Plus the main action/sci-fi plot was smart, interesting and well-paced. I cannot recommend this enough.

Although I don't read a lot of sci-fi, it seemed like one that would catch my attention.\n\nThe Droid in the series is sent with a science team to protect them while they work in the field on a new planet. What they don't know is the droid has hacked its primary module and would rather spend its time watching thousands of hours of videos. By overriding the primary module, it has also developed feelings and tends to ignore orders.\n\nWill the rogue droid protect his charges?

Murderbot is a rogue security robot who has overridden his programming to allow himself to make decisions of his own, and most importantly, watch TV and movies. He literally wants nothing more than to be left alone and to not have to deal with humans, which is ironic seeing as his exact job is to protect humans that he is assigned to. He finds emotions annoying, admits to half assing work, thinks humans are dumb and has funny commentary on all the little social routines/oddities humans all do for the sake of pleasantry and going through the motions.\n\nThis book also had a crazy amount of plot and world building for a novella! Super fun tech, lots of action and I would definitely see myself continuing the series on car trips.\n\nIs it a crazy stand out impressive story? No. Was I emotionally moved or on the edge of my seat? No! But it was fun and engaging from start to finish\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The protagonist, a robotic Security Unit (called the SEC Unit), saves her. The SEC Unit has hacked its governor module so humans can no longer control it, but they are not initially aware of this hack. It downloads currently popular soap operas and watches them during its downtime. It begins to develop feelings, though it would prefer not to interact with humans outside of official duties. It secretly refers to itself as “Murderbot” due to a past horrific malfunction.\n\nThe plot of this episode is action-packed, but the main attraction for me is the development of the SEC Unit from a robotic lifeform to an artificial intelligence more akin to human. I am impressed by the number of details that all had to be aligned. The ending is a setup for the Murderbot Series, but it can definitely be enjoyed as a standalone. Science fiction fans will not want to miss this one.\n\nThe audio is read by Kevin R. Free. This is one of my favorite audiobooks. The reader convinced me he was the SEC Unit. He has great pacing, articulation and subtle but effective changes in voicing for different characters.\n\n4.5\n\n2021-top-50\n \nadventure\n \nartificial-intelligence\n \n...more\n9 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Fiquei receoso de ouvir ficção científica em inglês, mas foi super fácil de acompanhar.\nA narração do Muderbot é bem rápida e divertida. Soltei umas risadas genuínas enquanto ouvia e o pessoal do ônibus deve ter me olhado estranho.\nO Muderbot ser um ROBÔ ASSASSINO COM DEPRESSÃO E ANSIEDADE SOCIAL foi simplesmente muito bom.\nNa hora do desespero ele é sempre muito honesto ou tem um humor muito mórbido, não importa qual das duas coisas ele use, sempre vai soar como uma piadinha.\nAchei que o final podia see um pouquinho mais detalhado, mas sei que tem mais por aí.\nAnsioso pelos próximos livros.\nPS: Queria muito assistir Sanctuary Moon com o Muderbot.\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Brilliant.\n\nIt's a taut, compelling tale with numerous asides that shed insights into the makeup of the main character and it's fascinating, I look forward to reading more of this.\n\nI'm also two episodes into the Murderbot mini-series on Apple+ TV and also enjoying it. So far, it's fairly faithful to the events of ALL SYSTEMS RED with a few changes.\n\nHowever, as much as I liked this, it's hard for me to understand how popular this became. I think hearing all the word-of-mouth praise and favorable reviews jacked up my expectation levels to a point where they would never be met. Too bad I didn't discover this on my own, but you can't keep up to date with all the multitude of choices we are presented with. Overwhelming.\n\nCloser to a 3.5 Star Rating.

{"username": "", "date": "All Systems Red, the first installment in Martha Wells' The Murderbot Diaries and winner of the 2018 Hugo, Locus, and Nebula Awards, is a heck of a lot of fun. This is a novella, so the premise is pretty simple - a rogue android has to help keep the humans who have contracted it for security alive during a planetary survey mission. Naturally, Wells inserts a few wrinkles along the way that point to something larger and more nefarious. A murderbot has to earn its pay, after all.\n\nWhat separates All Systems Red from the pack of droid hero science fiction is the character of Murderbot itself. Murderbot has hacked the governor module that controls and dictates its behavior, making it a free agent, if not for the fact that it has to hide this tidbit of information from its human employers. Despite being fully self-aware and keenly intelligent, Murderbot is still listed as inventory in the Company that contracts it out for security services, so certain ruses must be maintained if Murderbot doesn't want to see itself reformatted and re-enslaved to its corporate masters.\n\nMurderbot may not be human, although it does have some fleshy components, but it is most decidedly a person. Wells gives enough depth to Murderbot to make it sympathetic, relying on the android's personality and issues of human bias and notions of superiority in our historical dealings with artificial intelligences to give us a healthy degree of perspective on where exactly Murderbot is coming from.\n\nAnd where Murderbot is coming from is decidedly simple - it hates humans and just wants to be left alone to watch its favorite downloaded television shows. Never before have I found an artificial intelligence to be so utterly relatable! While I can fully sympathize with Murderbot's ambitions, it's pretty damn hilarious listening to its encounters with its new human crew and their attempts to humanize a wryly grumpy killing machine, and how Murderbot responds to such showings of support and empathy. The scientific team it is charged with protecting is nicely drama free, but Wells manages to wring a good bit of emotive action out of how Murderbot and its crew respond to each other. Wells doesn't get deeply philosophical about the nature of life, intelligence, and free will, but she does raise a few poignant issues worth thinking about over the course of this short book.\n\nExperiencing All Systems Red in audiobook format, though, leaves me slightly conflicted. It took me a while to warm to Kevin R. Free's narration, and while his reading here is serviceable I wish it were more engaging. Murderbot actually has feelings - it gets angry, its gets sarcastic, and it knows when it needs to be emotionally manipulative to draw out desired responses from the humans around it. Free's reading is dry and largely monotone; this makes for a dull listen despite Murderbot being anything but a dull character. I wish Free would have taken a livelier approach to the material, but I did eventually come around to his style - not enough to rave about his vocal showmanship, but enough that I'm still interested in pursuing this series in audio rather than switching over to print (at least for book two).\n\nAlthough the narration didn't do the story justice, the character of Murderbot is most definitely one worth paying attention to and has me eager to sink straight into Artificial Condition next.

It took me a while to warm to Kevin R. Free's narration, and while his reading here is serviceable I wish it were more engaging. Murderbot actually has feelings - it gets angry, its gets sarcastic, and it knows when it needs to be emotionally manipulative to draw out desired responses from the humans around it. Free's reading is dry and largely monotone; this makes for a dull listen despite Murderbot being anything but a dull character. I wish Free would have taken a livelier approach to the material, but I did eventually come around to his style - not enough to rave about his vocal showmanship, but enough that I'm still interested in pursuing this series in audio rather than switching over to print (at least for book two).\n\nAlthough the narration didn't do the story justice, the character of Murderbot is most definitely one worth paying attention to and has me eager to sink straight into Artificial Condition next. I can't wait to see what further hijinks my new favorite anti-social killing machine gets up to!\naudiobook\n \nbought\n \nsci-fi-fantasy\n10 likes\nLike\nComment"}

A robot trained to kill hostile fauna on alien planets while working alongside human exploration teams is the narrator. And what a character this robot, which calls itself a Murderbot, is.\n\nMurderbot hacks the governor module present in its system, essentially allowing it to decide whether to obey the commands sent by the clients who hired it, the choice which it would not have if the module had been operational.\n\nThe premise is utterly intriguing. And the first few lines of the book promise a great story and an entertaining tone for it. And the author delivers those promises.\n\n\nI COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\nSo this Murderbot uses all spare time it can get to watch sitcoms and entertainment content, despising human interaction and its job.\n\nI had thoroughly enjoyed reading this, not just because of the POV of the story or the tone of it, but also because of the story it had to offer. I was skeptical about the plot because how good would a plot be where the main character is a funny and brooding killing robot, but I was pleasantly surprised by how intense the story was. The action scenes and the suspense was so good, brief moments though they were. The plot gets a tad too contrived in the end for my liking, but this is a complaint I seem to be making for almost every book I read these days, so it wasn't that big a deal truly.\n\nI think people who are looking for something refreshing in terms of POV and story should read this, it's short and awesome.\nlesser-known-books\n \nsci-fi\n9 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Usually I am not a fan of novellas. I often have the feeling that the story the author is trying to tell is too big for the amount of pages, resulting in the reader feeling like he is missing information or that the story is rushed. This wasn't the case for this novella. It was just the right length. It also has a good ending, so that even though it is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone.\n\nThe opening was perfect. It manages to very effectively set the scene, introduce the main character and draw the reader in from the get go.\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satelites. It has been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nI really enjoyed the main character, Murderbot. Even though it is very explicitly stated that Murderbot doesn't have a sex, the reader cannot help to stop calling it an 'it' from very early on. I have noticed it differs per reader if it is a he or a she though. Nonetheless, he/she feels very much like a real person, even though it is a bot.\n\nThe plot is simple, the writing is direct, there is a healthy dose of humour and snarkyness, and the pacing is good. Overall, this was a very nice, light and short SF read. Definitely recommend picking this one up.\n10 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I say relationship because there’s no romance in the novella! There’s also a mystery?? And to be honest, it’s a little thrilling, my heart was in my throat the whole novella!!

The relief was intense, about even with finding out that the combat override module had been removed. I love you, armor, and I’m never leaving you again.\n\n\n\n\nTor.com offered Martha Wells' Murderbot series for free over the course of a week about a month or so ago, and I snapped them up like hot cakes at the Cracker Barrel on a Sunday morning. I knew, deep down in my robot-loving heart of hearts, that this was going to be a stellar offering.\n\nMurderbot does not disappoint. The story is set in a futuristic world of planetary travel and exploration, and told from the point of view of a construct of organic and inorganic parts that names itself \"Murderbot\" (a morbid attempt at humor after a failed mission). Hacking its governor, the processing unit that controls its behavior, Murderbot conceals its independence from its human clients and spends its downtime watching entertainment vids of space operas.\n\nThe exceptional element of this story is the voice of Murderbot, described by some as cynical and sulky. I found Murderbot charming as it tries to navigate its first encounter with humans who realize that it is independent of controls. There's a larger question, of course, of the sentience of the other constructs in the Murderbot universe, and the answer is not provided in this book. As a fan of Asimov, however, I am definitely interested in seeing where this thread of thought might lead.\n2020-dangerous-hero-addiction\n \n2020-may-reading-challenges\n \nhugo-winners\n \n...more\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I'm really glad I did because I didn't remember anything.\n_____\n\nAll Systems Red is a story about a team surveying a new planet told from the perspective of a security robot.\n\nMurderbot's perspective is a lot of fun. The robot is a hacked version of what it's supposed to be, so instead of being focused on the contract/clients, it's more focused on watching television shows. It's sassy and has as carefree an attitude as a robot can have.\nThe other characters served their purpose in the story. They filled the reader in on world building information and gave Murderbot a contract/purpose. Other than that, they were just sort of there. This is usually a negative, however for the purpose of this story it works and allows the focus to be placed on Murderbot.\n\nThe exploration of a new planet is one of my all time favourite science fiction plot lines. The exploration in this story was decent. The \"mystery\" is satisfactory, however I would have liked to discover more information, but that wasn't the purpose of the story. The focus of the story is on Murderbot as a \"person\" rather than what's going on around it.\n\n\nOverall, All Systems Red was a unique novella that sets up future stories that I will be definitely checking out.

They’re not well equipped and they’re not very clever, but they’ll rip themselves apart to protect their clients.\n\nWell, most of the time.\n\nMurderbot is different. Murderbot hacked their governor module and is a free agent pretending to still be enslaved. All Murderbot has to fear is someone noticing - in which case they’ll be junked for parts, at best - so it’s best if Murderbot keeps its head down and gets on with doing the half-assed job everyone expects it to do.\n\nBut these humans are nicer than most, and Murderbot is developing feelings. Which is awkward, because this planet seems pretty keen to kill them all.\n\nThis was a delight until the climax, which felt weirdly under written - I want to think it was Murderbot’s acute anxiety getting in the way of it relating the tale, but honestly it just felt a bit rough and rushed out. Which is a shame, as it means I ended a story that had been a sheer delight feeling a little awkward myself.\n\nBut I’ll be back for the sequel.\n\nSlightly fuller review\n\n...I originally gave this 3.5 stars because the ending didn't quite work for me, but it has stayed with me so it's getting a bump to a full 4 stars.

The fact that it might eventually question the human/AI distinction later on in the series just makes it even more appealing to me.\n\nMurderbot is a fantastic main character. A killing machine by design, they’re misanthropic, - but not in an overwhelming way - sarcastic, socially awkward, and so easy to instantly fall in love with.

I mean this with my whole chest.\n\nWhile All Systems Red does seem a little frivolous on its own, I’m hesitant to judge it by itself, because I’ve heard that the first four novellas in this series function as one complete arc. So, what I’ll say is this; yes, this is a little frivolous, but functionally this book is a toe-dip into the age old question of what it means to be human. Wells' writing is deft and competent, and with this first instalment, I feel like she might be opening a discussion into slavery, and what it might look like in a future where the slaves in question are constructs.\n\nI can’t wait to dive into the rest of this series and the only reason I haven’t already inhaled the rest of the books is because I’m behind on a bookclub pick ‘:D\nadult\n \nall-my-feels\n \nmcs-id-die-for\n \n...more\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

(With good reason. In the future, the dreaded Blue Screen of Death is sometimes literal.) Murderbot is clearly a hardcore introvert who is suffering from PTSD. From its point of view we get ruminations on free will and obligation, as well as honesty versus greed.\n\nThe story itself is about an exoplanet survey expedition that is experiencing mysterious technical glitches... which leads to murder. Good thing their SecUnit has some experience in this matter.\n\nI kept picturing Murderbot along the lines of the Robocop remake, which is actually a decent movie once you get past all the Robocop baggage. https://youtu.be/GlCN1EPAoHI\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the story and the world, and I’m in for the follow-up installments.\n2018-s-l-laser\n \nartificial-intelligence\n \ncyborg\n \n...more\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I'd never read or heard of Martha Wells before but now she's on my radar! This book is very short but took me far too long to read because I was on a trip and couldn't focus on it. I had to restart it twice. Once I got home I sat down with it and plowed through it. This book is in the POV of a security robot on a spaceship. It calls itself Murderbot, but only in private. I pictured Murderbot as a woman, I don't know why, maybe because it's a female author? But it is genderless. And it has feelings and emotions that it probably shouldn't have. Murderbot has deactivated its governor module so it can choose to follow commands or not. That sounds incredibly dangerous for all humans involved! This was a very interesting book and I look forward to reading more of the series!

The mystery of the plot kept me engaged throughout the entire story, as well as the interactions the crew had with Murderbot. Murderbot as a character was a wonderful enigma, which I really liked. The book explored the idea of what makes a sentient being more or less human, and the idea of whether A.I.s should remain autonomous or if they should always be under some type of human control. What would happen if humans lost that control?\n\nFor a novella just around 150 pages, this book read like a much longer book...in a good way. Lots of plot and character development in such a small space. It seems like there are quite a few mysteries left unanswered, so I'm intrigued how they will be answered in the novellas to come.\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

He is cheaply constructed, poorly maintained and rented out to the company's clients to provide security on planetary surveying expeditions.\nNo one has noticed that he has disabled his own governing device and has now gone rogue. He calls himself Murderbot because he recognizes that he and his kind were basically designed for one purpose, to kill.\nHe is on a routine mission, doing pretty much nothing with a scientific crew that has his contract this time. He won't kill anyone. He has no reason to.\nHe is bored. He downloads entertainment serials to fight the boredom. Then all hell breaks loose.I\nA must read.\n8 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I mean, really, who couldn't empathise with this?\n\nHowever, while I loved Murderbot herself, I wasn't completely invested in the story. The other characters were also a little flat - I appreciate there is only so much time in a novella, but it was frustrating because I really wanted to enjoy the characters and read more about their personalities and group dynamics with Murderbot. I had a good laugh at points and enjoyed Wells' writing style, and I will definitely read the following novellas, but overall I was a little bit disappointed after all the hype.\nlgbtq\n \nmade-me-giggle\n \nsci-fi\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

En ella, conocemos a Matabot, una Seg-Unidad —un androide creado para proteger a los humanos durante expediciones— que ha hackeado su propio módulo de control para evitar convertirse en una máquina de matar. En vez de obedecer sin cuestionar, dedica su tiempo libre a ver series.\n\nLa historia se desarrolla en un lejano planeta, donde Matabot acompaña a un grupo de científicos. Su misión se complica cuando otro equipo desaparece, lo que obliga a Matabot y sus humanos a investigar el extraño suceso por sí mismos. Pero más allá del misterio sobre el que gira la trama, el verdadero atractivo es el propio Matabot como narrador: su voz interior es sarcástica, cargada de ironía, profundamente introvertida y con una ansiedad social que lo hace sorprendentemente humano y con el que es fácil sentirse identificado.\n\nA pesar de su apariencia letal, Matabot se muestra con muchas inseguridades, dubitativo en su relación con los humanos aunque haya devorado centenares de horas de telenovelas para aprender sus maneras de hacer las cosas.\n\nEsta contradicción entre su potencia física y su vulnerabilidad emocional convierte al personaje en algo más que un simple robot de acción. Además, el relato entra en temas más profundos como el libre albedrío o la identidad, sin perder un ritmo ágil ni su tono irónico. Siendo una novela corta que engancha sin necesidad de grandes giros de guión o escenas repletas de acción.\n\nPor lo que si te interesa una ciencia ficción ligera pero con peso emocional y un androide con crisis existenciales, “Tots els Sistemes en Vermell” es una lectura muy recomendable.\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I was expecting something—hopefully good—that I could read in a day, maybe setting me up to continue the adventure later in the year.\n\nAnd I got that.\n\nWhile the plot and the story aren't anything significant, they're not bad exactly. Just compact to fit in the shorter size. The reason to read ASR is the Murderbot perspective. Not exactly human, while not a robot either, with no interpersonal skills and a lack of gender make the Murderbot—well, unique.\n\nI quite liked it, though not enough that I'd think of paying $10+ for the next one. Hell, I didn't even pay for this one—that's what libraries are for. But as it took over a year for them to acquire this first one... well, I may have a wait ahead of me. That said, it IS crucially important to support authors by buying their material. So... I'm torn. The first one I'd pay full-toke for. The second... maybe get it on sale?

It's antipathy for anything but watching the equivalent of netflix is endearing when it also seems to grudgingly care about the humans in its care.

The murderbot is such a good character and his dead panness was just perfect on point.\nAlso my little fujoshi heart had a some fun shipping him (yes he's a him for me, throws stones) with the augmented human of the team.\nAnd the ending was so fitting.

I'm guessing it could be related to the fact that he (?) hacked his own governor module, or is it just how self-aware AI robots are supposed to work here?

They're not a big fan of the humans and would much rather be left alone to watch their serials than interact with them. However, win another exploratory mission goes dark, it's up to the exploratory crew and the Murderbot, as they refer to themselves, to find out what happened to the crew and who's responsible.\n\nThis was a quick, action-packed, fun novella. I liked the snark and honesty of the Murderbot. The pacing was pretty good and the character development and world building were good. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series.

{"username": "", "date": "2010s", "text": "Kate (Feathered Turtle Press Reviews)\n401 reviews\n77 followers\nFollow\nMarch 19, 2021\nThe Good\n– Sharp storytelling\n– Fun and entertaining\n– Incredibly likeable main character\n– Quick and easy to read\n\nThe Bad\n– A few critically weak points in prose\n– Hard to keep track of secondary characters at times\n\nLegit, Murderbot charmed its way into my heart by the end of the first paragraph.\n\nStory\nQuick, straightforward and enjoyable.\n\nAfter Murderbot—a security construct who's hacked itself into autonomy—rescues a member of the survey team under its protection from a dangerous creature not registered on the planet's flora and fauna list, the group realizes something is wrong. They're unsure if the missing details in their information are an attempt at sabotage or a genuine error on the company's part, who are known for cutting corners and supplying cheap equipment.\n\nHowever, the necessary actions it takes to save Dr. Volescu and Dr. Bharadwaj reveal it's more human than the team believed: for one, the security bots have a human face. A \"generic\" one, but something human-looking all the same. If Murderbot's autonomy is discovered by the company, they will terminate it and scrap it for parts.\n\nMurderbot does not want to be terminated and scrapped for parts. Murderbot wants to watch media programs.\n\nWells has combined a lovely mixture of fun, conversational storytelling with some brutal moments and questions about humanness. All Systems Red is entertaining and compulsively readable without feeling overwhelming. There were a couple parts that I thought could be tightened further or where Wells could dig in a little more. But overall it's a very, very good novella. There's almost always something to look forward to if there isn't anything already something interesting and enjoyable on the page.\n\nCharacters\nMurderbot is a star. Murderbot makes All Systems Red a star.\n\nMurderbot is both someone other and unfamiliar—how it functions, what it's capable of, its position in the universe—and something painfully human and relatable. It's lazy. It's socially awkward. It really, really wants to watch some TV. In this way, Murderbot is both distinctly human and distinctly not, and it is a charming and wonderful narrator.\n\nSomething I loved about Murderbot from a world-building angle is how Wells balanced Murderbot's murder abilities with its comparative fragility. Is Murderbot terrifying compared to squishy humans? Absolutely. Can Murderbot take a frankly horrifying amount of damage while still remaining functional? Oh, yeah. But at the end of the day, it's still one security android comprised of cheap parts up against other security android comprised of cheap parts. To quote: This is how we fight: throw ourselves at each other and see whose parts give out first.\n\nMurderbot is in charge of the safety of eight humans, who are somewhat frustrating to keep track of mentally. This is due in part to the restraints of the novella, and in part to what the story is trying to achieve. We need to care about these humans at least a little bit, but it doesn't make sense to flesh them out too deeply when there isn't room for in the narrative. Wells has come up with a delightful explanation for this in the book, but it doesn't change the fact that outside of Dr. Mensah and Dr. Gurathin, the cast is rather interchangeable.\n\nWriting Style\nTold in first person, something tense, Wells conveys All Systems Red in a conversational, accessible and wry style.\n\nDespite this, there are some occasional weak points an established author should've eliminated from their prose by now—namely a surprising number of had hads.\n\nThemes and Representation\nTouches on the ethics and morality of ownership of self-aware beings.\n\nThere are minimal details about them, but the supporting cast was culturally diverse and there was at least one LGBT+ relationship among them. Polyamorous relationships and marriages are common.\n\nRecommended For...\nThose who want a short, well-rounded story with an immensely delightful main character.\n\n>>More book reviews at Feathered Turtle Press<<\n2010s\n \nreading-challenge-previous\n \nscifi-fantasy-gen-or-adult\n \n...more\n8 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Its fighting style isn't so much about brilliant skills and strategies as it is about throwing itself at an enemy until the enemy is dead, which is only possible because 1) Murderbot is hard to kill and 2) it has self-repairing abilities as long as it has access to its cubicle. I got a bit of a kick out of the difference between its reaction to its own injuries and the scientists' reactions.

The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.” - Murderbot\n\nBook Details:\nGenres: Science Fiction\nNarration Type: 1st Person (Murderbot’s POV)\nLiterary Tropes: Artificial Intelligence, Cyborgs, Dystopian Future, Found Family, Genetic Modification, Robots, Space Exploration\nReading Age: 14+\nTrigger warnings: Death, Gun Violence, Injury/Injury Detail, Murder, Slavery, Violence\n\nThoughts:\n- Explores issues of identity and free will but in a way that doesn’t feel preachy.\n- Murderbot is really neurotic and I loved that. Not human enough to understand and feel comfortable around other humans. Not machine enough to shut down his emotions completely.\n- Murderbot’s whole vibe is that photo of Ben Affleck smoking looking like he’s over everything.\n\n\n- I love that Murderbot openly and vocally loves soap operas and other trashy entertainment shows.\n\nRecommendation:\nI don’t think it’s an understatement to say this series is beloved amongst sci-fi fans and it has the credentials to back it up. This novella won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for Best Novella in 2018. Because of that I may have gone into All Systems Red with my hopes a little too high because I liked it but it didn’t blow me away. Still, it was good enough that I would recommend it and I plan on reading the next book.\n\n\nPlot Summary:FULL SPOILERS\n\n\nThe story is narrated by Murderbot, a human robot hybrid that has regrowable organic human parts. This type of robot is known as a Security Unit (SecUnit for short). It has been programmed to act as security for clients who contract its services through whatever agency owns them. It must keep clients alive at all costs. Nearly all its parts are regrowable.\n\nMurderbot is controlled by a “Governor Module” which requires it to follow specific agency directives. It has hacked its governor module giving it some free will which it primarily uses to download and watch soap operas.\n\nMurderbot’s current contract is providing security for a group of humans doing planetary exploration. The group is attacked by a giant worm. Murderbot successfully saves the lives of several crew members by putting himself in the worm's mouth and shooting a missile down its throat.\n\nWhile bringing the injured members of the party back Murderbot shows them its face. No one in the group realized it had a human face as it had always worn a helm. Murderbot intentionally wore the helm so clients wouldn’t see it as human because it isn’t human enough to fully grasp their feelings and emotions and prefers to avoid it.\n\nThe leader of the exploratory mission is Dr. Mensah, and she summons Murderbot to a meeting the following day. The group talks about how their group, PreservationAux, bought the land around them to inspect the planet’s resources. But the materials they received previously had been tampered with.\n\nMurderbot scans the documents and finds that information about the giant worms has been removed, and it finds false information in its place. Mensah instructs the crew to search through the information they have, in case anything else seems suspicious.\n\nMensah contacts another exploratory crew called DeltFall which is camped on the other side of the planet. DeltFall agrees to share their data. Most of the crew finds issues with their information. Only Murderbot has accurate data so it checks the perimeter for any issues. Mensah and Murderbot discuss why the crew has incorrect information. Murderbot believes that the most likely reason is faulty and cheap equipment provided by the corporation.\n\nMensah pilots a hopper and a crew member notices a possible issue with the autopilot. The crew lands and splits up. The crew realizes their maps are not accurate. Only Murderbot’s map is still accurate, so it needs to help the crew avoid danger.\n\nThe crew heads back to base. Murderbot’s HubSystem sends a notification that Murderbot’s systems are being updated. Murderbot is too busy watching its soap to allow these updates to install, so it puts them off for later.\n\nMensah tells Murderbot that DeltFall has gone quiet and something is wrong. Mensah needs to head over there to rescue them if they need help. Murderbot insists on going with them for protection. On the way there, Murderbot tells the crew that the satellite feed has stopped working. The crew arrives at DeltFall and finds everyone dead.\n\nMurderbot finds a dead SecUnit, which is surprising because they’re difficult to kill. Murderbot knows there were three SecUnits at DeltFall, so it theorizes that the SecUnits turned on the humans and the humans tried to fight back, and only managed to destroy one of them.\n\nMurderbot finds and kills the other two SecUnits but gets hit and blacks out. It wakes up on a table to find a SecUnit stabbing it in the neck, so Murderbot shoots the SecUnit in the head. Another one appears, and Mensah manages to take this one out. Mensah takes Murderbot back to the hopper. Murderbot is unable to scan its surroundings properly, and realizes that one of the SecUnits inserted something into its dataport.\n\nMurderbot believes the other SecUnits must have had the same thing inserted, which then overrode their usual combat commands. Murderbot tells Mensah to shut it down, but Mensah thinks they can save it. Murderbot shoots itself in the chest not wanting to die but knowing the humans wouldn’t do it themselves.\n\nMurderbot wakes up. The module was removed by a crew member. One of the other crew members reveals that he knows that Murderbot disabled its governor module, and that’s why he doesn’t trust it. The rest of the crew argue that Murderbot having had free will the whole time and not harming them should be more reason to trust it.\n\nThe crew speculates that the agency that hired them is trying to kill them. They discuss the hacked SecUnits and Murderbot reassures the crew that it is not going to kill anyone. The crew decides the agency probably isn’t behind the killing but it could well have accepted a bribe from whoever is hacking into things. They call this unknown enemy EvilSurvey. They suspect it has something to do with the hidden areas of the maps. The crew sets off an emergency beacon to draw EvilSurvey in.\n\nMurderbot asks whether PreservationAux’s political entity will miss them if they die. The crew is confused by this question and says Mensah is their political entity and is an elected official. A member of the crew (Gurathin) asks Murderbot if it was ever punished for malfunctioning and murdering a prior group it was contracted to. Murderbot says that SecUnits are too expensive to decommission and destroy but that it was punished.\n\nMurderbot reveals camera footage from the original base and sees the EvilSurvey crew, who have five SecUnits with them and are called GrayCris. They left a message for the crew advising that they destroyed the emergency beacon. GrayCris requests a meeting with PreservationAux. Murderbot and Mensah agree that GrayCris will probably kill them all if they meet with them but they head to meet them anyway so they can find out what data they’re gathering from the hidden areas.\n\nAt the meeting, Mensah informs GrayCris that her crew has evidence of everything illegal that GrayCris has done. She says if anything happens to her or her crew, the evidence will be sent to higher powers. GrayCris suggests they want to bargain.\n\nMurderbot tells GrayCris that it knows they are planning to override its combat module. It offers to join them and feed them information. Murderbot says that Mensah knows that GrayCris plans to kill her. It informs them that she is a political entity and they can’t kill her without wrecking everything. GrayCris sends Murderbot and another SecUnit to get Mensah. Murderbot kills the SecUnit.\n\nMurderbot tells Mensah to pretend to be a prisoner. Murderbot pretends to be the SecUnit it just killed. It takes Mensah to GrayCris, who assure her that her crew won’t be harmed. Mensah says her crew has found evidence of a former habitat on the planet. They believe GrayCris is digging up the remnants to sell.\n\nThe rest of the crew arrives at GrayCris base. Pin-Lee and Gurathin try to hack into the emergency beacon off site. The SecUnits realize this and everyone starts shooting at Murderbot. Murderbot tells Pin-Lee to destroy it and leave it behind but Mensah doesn’t want to do that. Murderbot goes offline. It wakes up at the company station. Ratthi informs Murderbot that Mensah bought its contract so that Murderbot can live on Preservation Alliance where bots are considered full citizens.\n\nMensah talks to Murderbot about its future plans as a free agent. Murderbot doesn’t love the idea of living in Preservation because it feels lost if it’s not protecting somebody. It decides to find a cargo ship and pretend to be a servant bot to get a ride. The cargo ship is impressed by Murderbot’s collection of downloaded soaps. Murderbot leaves Preservation.\n\nOther Reviews in Series:\nAll Systems Red - Review\nArtificial Condition - Review\nRogue Protocol - Review\nExit Strategy - Review\nNetwork Effect - Review\nFugitive Telemetry - Review\nSystem Collapse - Review\nyear-2024\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Now it can act freely, but that doesn't mean it will leave the humans in danger.\n\nI loved reading in the Murderbot's PoV. I was afraid it would sound mechanical, but it didn't - and it was really entertaining. A shy, murderous droid. It works.\n\nI loved how this book avoided the \"AI falls in love and discovers they're more human than they thought\" trope - one of the many overused subtropes of \"romantic love makes us human\", which I hate (I'm looking at you, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, and also at you, Defy the Stars). Murderbot is not human. Murderbot doesn't want to be human. That means it doesn't necessarily want what the humans want, and that doesn't mean it's evil.\nSince Murderbot is not exactly what humans expect when they think about machines, there's a lot of awkwardness between it and the human crew - they do not know how to deal with a machine that looks like a human and almost acts like a human, but it's definitely not one.\n\nMost side characters are forgettable, but there is a side f/f relationship and this is only a novella.\n\nNote: yes, the main character doesn't have a gender and is not interested in sex or romance, but I wouldn't recommend this book as \"aro/ace/agender representation\" - it's about a robot.\nAromantic/asexual/agender people are real and definitely human.\nadult\n \nbest-mcs\n \nloved-it\n \n...more\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Programmed to be a mass murdering machine, Murderbot defies its orders by hacking into its governor module and going rogue. What might a killing robot do once its not bound to anyone? Why stream and download all the shows on the entertainment feed. All it wants to do is watch its shows and be left in peace, however, the universe has other plans.\n\n\"I could become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\"\n\nMurderbot is the epitome of my extremely introverted and shy self, encapsulating all the awkwardness within my social life. Literally, if I could be programmed into a robot, the result would be Murderbot. It was strangely satisfying to see this aspect in a supposedly dangerous entity.\n\n\"Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.\"\n\nThe story really transports you into the middle of the conflict in a totally different world. It was honestly jarring to start the story with the multitude of terms and other elements I have to get used to. But once I found my footing, the story really took off. I really enjoyed the diversity of the cast and enjoyable banter between them. It was really sweet ho they treated Murderbot, although he was rather mortified by their attentions, which really made those scenes that much hilarious. I just wanted a bit more and a less rushed conclusion, but alas I understand since it is a novella.\n\nHighly recommend if you're in the mood for a sci-fi novella.\nbooks-owned\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

And now I know why.\n\nA team of scientists, along with their required android, or SecUnit as it’s called, are conducting survey tests on a remote planet. Should be easy. But when another team is massacred, they realize they’re next and they aren’t prepared.\n\nMurderbot is what it calls itself. And when you learn it’s history, the name is apt. It was easy to like Muderbot. It’s got a lot of human qualities, like sarcasm, introspection and wanting to know who it is. I was curious too. It’s not a sexbot, so no sexual organs, I was curious about what face it wore under the armor. Did it look like a man or a woman? I was left wondering and hope future stories reveal that to me. And it’s very human in another way, spending hours watching the future’s version of a Netflix show. I’d binge this series if Netflix offered it. Don’t let this fool you about the SecUnit. It’s not a combat model, but when required, it goes at it’s enemy no hold’s barred, risking injury to inflict the most damage.\n\nWhat made this read real for me was that it’s always assumed that with the advanced technology that enables us to travel in space, we come to expect it to “look” advanced. For the ships and all the other things that come with it to be like shiny new toys and everything works right. Not so here. It’s the same as always, cheaper is better and cutting corners is always the first choice. Which causes quite a few problems for the crew and for Murderbot.\n\nI had so much fun with All Systems Red and am already reading the next book. The ending here left me so curious. What does the future hold for Muderbot?\n\nThanks so much to TOR for the complimentary copy. My review is voluntarily given.\nscience-fiction\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

More than a few people I know claim that the MurderBot series are the best things she's ever written. That's high praise indeed, when you consider Martha Wells' output.\n\nI have little to be critical of in this tale, except to say that whatever other folks saw in this book, I did not. It dragged and meandered. While I appreciated some of the jokes regarding MurderBot's utter disdain for the humans be works with, it got tiresome quickly. I never could come to like it as a protagonist. It was snarky and superior to the point of being unsympathetic. Neither did I develop a fondness for the people in the unit which MurderBot worked with. So, I was left with a stage set with no one I cared about, all engaging in life or death struggles meant to keep me on the edge of my seat. But the edge was never as comfortable as leaning back, flipping another page, and waiting for the book to end so I could get on to something I enjoyed more. By the end, I was reading All Systems Red a little like MurderBot looked at the humans around him - with disdain and a desire to watch soap operas instead.\n2018\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is assigned to a scientific mission, exploring a new planet, that goes horribly wrong when one of its teams goes radio silent. All it wants, really, is to be left alone to watch its shows and come to terms with its identity, but in the end it can't ignore its feeling of responsibility towards its scientists.\n\nThe scientists, for their part, are somewhat startled to figure out that Murderbot has a personality. It's a lot to process while they're all busy investigating what the heck happened to the other team and then fighting for their lives. I thought the decisions made by the scientists and Murderbot near the end each made complete sense based on who they were, and the ending was a good jumping off point for the next book in the series, which I will absolutely be reading.\n0-genre-scifi\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

It has adventure and murders and a bit of a mystery and tough decisions to make.\n\nI think that, like with every good book in the history of books, this story makes you question things.

Cheesy, campy, rollicking fun... and emotionally poignant. There's some surprisingly heavy themes wrapped up in this bit of easily digestible fluff, and I think I have a new favorite character.\n\nThe shortness does have some downsides. The characters don't get much description, and there's a lot of telling instead of showing, but I suspect that's intentional. Somehow, maybe because of the brevity, it manages to work, coming across as Murderbot telling its story to the reader. But that same shortness keeps the story cohesive (if, as previously mentioned, quite campy).\n\nI don't know. Eternal classic of literature? Probably not, but it was exactly what I needed.

Matabot destaca por haber hackeado su sistema y programación y poder hacer un poco lo que le viene en gana. Esto hace que se desarrolle mejor su personalidad, que es mucho más introvertida y contestataria de lo que podría esperarse de un ser creado para obedecer y hacer uso de la violencia. Si a eso le sumamos fuertes dosis de cinismo y misantropía, da lugar a una criatura, muy a su pesar, llena de carisma, que se convierte en una excelente e incluso graciosa narradora. Vamos, que es algo así como un Bender de Futurama pero con cañones incorporados. Crítica completa: https://libros-prohibidos.com/martha-...\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The main character of Murderbot was the focus of the book and the standout character. The unimportant plot and the lack of development for other characters did not affect the enjoyment of this book massively; this novella felt like the introduction of Murderbot's character and the world for the author to later expand for future books in this series. The author excelled in that aspect: making Murderbot an interesting and fun character I would like to follow in the subsequent installments.\n6.5/10\n9 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I really thought I was going to love this, but it was both boring and overly vague, which is never a good combination.\n\nI did like the character of Murderbot, but felt no connection to any of the other characters. It was difficult to follow both the plot and the world building and, as someone who frequently reads high fantasy with complex worlds and stories, I was surprised this was so confusing to me.\n\nI feel like this would work better as a film or TV show so we could at least visualise all the technology mentioned, but as it stands I found nothing to really enjoy other than some of Murderbot's humorous comments. I never knew a novella could drag so much or that a sci-fi mystery could be so uninteresting.\n8 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

It was worth the wait.\n\nDamn, its good character driven sci-fi and what a character he is! I LOVE Murderbot.\nI identify so much with him. Anyone else wish they had a visor? His snark and openness about how he doesn't care about things had me laughing out loud. This book has many highlightable one-liners.\n\nThis is a very different Sci-Fi, the book concentrates on the first person experience of situations rather than the tech so it reads very easy despite being sci-fi. Its also a short book but I felt I really 'knew' Murderbot whilst at the same time want to know more.\n8 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I was blown away by how much I loved All Systems Red. People had been telling me for ages that I needed to give Murderbot a try, and now I’m kicking myself for waiting so long.\n\nWe follow a SecUnit, part robot and part organic, who has hacked itself and quietly nicknamed itself Murderbot. Despite the name, it is way more relatable than you would think. Murderbot’s voice is funny, awkward, and strangely human, and I found myself connecting with it immediately.\n\nWhat really impressed me was how approachable this book was. I’m not usually a big sci-fi reader because I tend to get lost in the heavy, confusing worldbuilding at the start of most books. But Wells eases you in, giving just enough detail to ground you without slowing down the story. The novella length worked perfectly too, short enough to binge in one sitting (or two for us slower readers) but never felt like it was missing anything.\n\nThis is not a book with a super intricate mystery or deep side character development, but that is not what it is trying to be. It is a fast-paced, snarky, and surprisingly heartfelt story about a robot who just wants to be left alone to watch TV.\n\nI’ll definitely be continuing the series, and luckily there are SEVERAL more novellas already out so I don’t even have to wait! This is perfect for readers looking for a quick, bingeable sci-fi with an antisocial robot narrator who will win you over in no time.\naudio\n \nhumor\n \nnovella\n \n...more\n8 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

But the recent Audible summer deal made it too good to pass up, and I'm so glad that I finally gave it a try. Murderbot is just such a unique character - antisocial, existential, but ultimately empathetic. After reading A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet earlier this summer, I was already loving the \"AI trying to come to terms with who/what they are\" trope. This is a different take on it, but equally appealing. I may need to spend some more time in recent sci-fi. I'm finding such good examples of the genre that are pulling me in more and more, and I'll definitely be reading the rest of the Murderbot novellas and eventual novel!\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

A very enjoyable scifi world and the characters are great. I'd say the book and the show mostly hold up to each other but minus the few characters that aren't in the show adaptation and Dr Gurathin features much more in the show.

I searched for a glossary online but didn’t find a good one.)\n\nThe premise was very interesting, and overall I did enjoy it, but I was frustrated by not understanding everything. There would be these “big reveal” moments where something would happen that’s supposed to stun us, but I wouldn’t get it. Then the narrator would explain why it’s supposed to stun us, like “… since the lasers weren’t in the right formation, we knew the sabotage was coming from the Galorpians…”. Those bits helped, but I always felt a step behind.\n\nI’m not sure whether I want to keep going with this series. I think I do get why some people love it though. If I understood it a little bit more I’d probably feel the same way.\n\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.”\n\n\nYou can also read this review on my blog. (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧\n\nShort and punchy but thought-provoking, All Systems Red is the first novella in the Murderbot Diaries series by Martha Wells, featuring the titular Murderbot as the protagonist. It’s a mystery-adventure set in deep space, with cool tech and a complex, interesting world. Also, much to my enjoyment, it explored ideas I love to see in scifi: what it means to be a person and how technology impacts society.\n\nThe point-of-view character and protagonist, a corporation-owned security robot, gave itself its name after the company’s cheap parts led to a hardware malfunction and, ultimately, a murderous rampage on the part of Murderbot. Not wanting to be subjected to catastrophic parts failures again, it hacked its own Governor Module and gave itself free will. What does Murderbot want to do now that it doesn’t explicitly have to obey company and client orders? Well, watch a whole lot of space soap operas and download massive amounts of data from entertainment feeds, that’s what:\n\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,00 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\n#relatable.\n\n(Not the murder part, but like...I feel you, Murderbot. Sometimes a sentient being just wants to be left alone and devour some entertainment, y’know?)\n\n(I want to add that I’m referring to Murderbot as “it” because that seems like the pronoun it prefers, and it doesn’t identify with any gender. If that ever changes in later novellas or the upcoming novel, I’ll add another note to this!)\n\nI want to emphasize that I love that Murderbot explicity doesn’t want to be human. Not in a “ew, humans are gross” kind of way, but in a “I am a different form of life and that is perfectly fine, even if I myself haven’t exactly figured out what I want to be” sort of way. It’s great and Murderbot is great and you should read this. Yes, you. Please.\n\nThe setup for this novella is already interesting on its own: it’s kind of unsettlingly similar to our current situation with late-stage capitalism, just worse, with more advanced technology, and in space. It’s not completely doom and gloom, though; while mega-corporations are omnipresent and even have their own corporate states, they’re not all-powerful. There are other free states and ways of living. (Speaking of, the diversity rep in the novel is great, with many characters mentioning having multiple partners/same gender partners, and none of the humans I can recall as being white.) So while the world is still often a shitty place in both large and small ways, it’s not hopelessly bleak. In that way, the setting and plot provide an interesting layer of commentary on corporate motivations and how people move around and within money-hungry power structures.\n\nWhile the plot of this novella is short, it’s entertaining and to the point. We have just enough time to take a walk in Murderbot’s shoes, seeing the world through its sardonic point of view, while also seeing how its human crew reacts to its sentience. There’s enough space for the plot and characters to create and release tension around ideas of humanity and free will without the dialogue getting esoteric or the narration getting info-dumpy. The story sticks around just long enough to make you ready to read the next novella right away.\n\nBefore I try to wrap this up: a nod (or like, many many nods) to Kevin R. Free, the audiobook narrator/reader. I’ve listened to one other novella he’s narrated, The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps, and his voice and inflection in both of these works of his that I’ve listened to are absolutely wonderful. I can’t imagine Murderbot sounding any other way in my head now. (Speaking of which, my library needs to get the audiobook for the next ones in the series ASAP.)\n\nI can’t think of a good way to end this review, if I’m being honest. In the process of writing this, I actually bumped my rating up from 4 to 4.5, rounded up to a 5. I just liked it that much, and it used the novella format exceptionally well to tell its story.

(Speaking of which, my library needs to get the audiobook for the next ones in the series ASAP.)\n\nI can’t think of a good way to end this review, if I’m being honest. In the process of writing this, I actually bumped my rating up from 4 to 4.5, rounded up to a 5. I just liked it that much, and it used the novella format exceptionally well to tell its story. I highly recommend checking it out if you have the chance.\naudio\n \nfavorites\n \ngreat-protag\n \n...more\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The praise it was getting was unquestionable and its blurb alone had me hooked and utterly curious to find out what all the fuzz was about. Dying to try novellas again, this series seemed like the perfect re-entry point for me. I mean, how could anything go wrong with an android called a “Murderbot” being the main character? In the end, there’s no denying that this turned out to be addictive and engaging. The journey of this Murderbot is one that develops steadily with a satisfying balance between action and humour.\n\nWhat exactly is All Systems Red about though? This is the story of a SecUnit tasked to protect a team of scientists on their expedition in dangerous fields. Unlike other androids, this one however hacked its governor module (the very component that allows humans to control them) and successfully got its hands on what we would call “free will”. Instead of turning rampant or escaping its faith as a SecUnit, this android has assigned itself the purpose of protecting its clients at all cost. Remaining inconspicuous among the team is however a struggle, but whenever it can, it will find ways to avoid contact and find peace in isolation. It’s when things go awry with another crew of scientists that this android and its clients find themselves looking for answers, but also pernicious trouble, with unknown danger staring right back at them.\n\nFor a first installment in The Murderbot Diaries series, All Systems Red does a comprehensive portrayal of artificial intelligence in ways that have rarely been conducted in the past. Instead of having a robot who wants to become human, we find ourselves in front of one that is human. Its personality is incredibly relatable and far more human than some of us could ever be, but this Murderbot only wishes to be left alone in its introverted lifestyle. Stuck trying to hide its true self from a crew of scientists who would never truly understand it, it finds satisfaction in accomplishing its role as a Company-supplied security android in order to stay away from any potential trouble that the knowledge of its free will would have upon it.\n\nInterestingly enough, this Murderbot is never referred to as a male or a female throughout the story. While I saw it as a woman all along, I was far too often able to connect myself to its most deepest desires (i.e. being left alone to enjoy some space soap opera). Martha Wells’ writing style also proves to be impeccable in All Systems Red and effortlessly manages to give this android a voice of its own. Without the focus on its gender, she was able to bring the reader to explore subtler details that helped further accentuate the android’s peculiar situation in a world of humans that only sees things from their own selfish position.\n\nAll Systems Red is a fascinating novella that follows an introverted android in its quest to embrace its true-self while trying to respect its purposes as a Murderbot. What it will come to realize will however force it to embark on an adventure that it might not ever be ready for, as both its purpose and its rights as an android with free will are tested.\n\nThank you to Raincoast Books and Tor.com / Tom Doherty Associates for sending me a copy for review!\n\nYours truly,\n\nLashaan | Blogger and Book Reviewer\nOfficial blog: https://bookidote.com/\n_______________________\n\nAn introverted robot trying to hide her personality from the world finds herself embracing her true-self without realizing what it might actually entail.

Plus, I wouldn't be quite harsh on it as I have a different expectation of a just above 30k novella compared to like 100k - 400k novel. For what its intents to achieve I think Murderbot does its job well, which is liking the named protagonist.\n\nEdit: I should rephrase I don't think I gave Martha Wells enough credit but Murderbot, not just a likable protagonist. I think She does a good job of fleshing him out. Showcasing AI in a unique perspective. The Shy aspect of Murderbot is pretty great, it does feel distinct.\n\nAs from the introduction it states\n\n\n“ I COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\n\n\nWhich I mean is a great hook to a series, the status quo of series of this nature already bent. I do think booktube has given this novella or series (well I should read the rest to see if that is true) but a false expectation. This is nothing deep or found thought-provoking which contrast to what I been reading recently is not a bad thing. It delivers on it being a fun adventure all around. Besides the opening paragraph, I won’t give anything else regarding the plot as it probably spoils half this novella. The plot in general nothing to hit home about which is fine. The characters voices are not that distinct not even about being well fleshed out as you got like 3-4 humans and 30k word count, you got to be realistic in terms of priorities. Just hoped voices were a bit more distinct. The prose well does its job in its first-person, especially at the end its well contextualised. They some distance to the writing style which is quite clear and to the point which reflects on the character well enough. The Worldbuilding I don’t have too many thoughts on but for a novella and what it sets out I am not going to be critical about that aspect, plus murderbot doesn’t give a shit about the world so that’s why we don’t know too much.

{"username": "", "date": "Everything about this book was completely out of my comfort zone and not at all what I would gravitate towards, but I enjoyed it so much. The protagonist was more endearing than most other protagonists I've read, despite being part-robot. The storytelling was solid, and the plot was such a breath of fresh air. This is a 4 to 4.5* read for me, with the only thing stopping it from being a 5* simply being that I zoned out sometimes during the more sci-fi-ish bits, which was sometimes quite dense for a sci-fi layperson like me.\n\nThis is a pretty short book, but it took me probably more than half of it to figure out exactly what was going on in terms of the world, the plot, and even just the names for everything (I'm just not used to so much sci-fi and tech jargon in my books). Despite that, the book still managed to be engaging enough almost right from the start, primarily due to the the protagonist's engaging voice - it might be a Murderbot, but it's also just a really shy, introverted entity that just wants to hide behind its opaque face shield thing all day, watch the amazing amount of TV serials it's downloaded, and not have to talk to humans, especially not about its feelings. Honestly, kind of relatable.\n\nMurderbot (it doesn't really have an actual name, so we'll just call it that) is contracted out to a group of scientists and explorers, presumably in some spacefaring civilisation. It's actually a SecUnit (a security unit) that is rented out to these expeditions to protect people from hostile alien lifeforms (or other humans, I suppose). We kinda sorta get to know the scientists in Murderbot's group and they play a big role in the actual plot of this particular story, but the book being as short as it is means that we don't get the time to actually know these characters very well. While I'd love to hear more of them in the subsequent instalments, the main attraction of the story really is Murderbot and its perspective so I wouldn't say this at all detracts from the beauty of the book.\n\nThe group and Murderbot discover another expedition of scientists brutally murdered, and then it's a rollercoaster ride from there as they try to figure out who's behind that massacre before the culprits catch up with them to do the same.\n\nWhat I particularly liked about the storytelling is that, even though we get the events from Murderbot's perspective, we can't help also feeling a little distrustful of Murderbot and wondering if it might be an unreliable narrator. Does that mean I'm siding with the humans over the non-human, even though we are seeing the story through the latter's eyes? What makes Murderbot, who is only part-robot with \"organic parts\" (i.e. human bits, since it has an actual face and other human organs, which it is able to regenerate when injured or even regrow when it's completely blasted off), different from the augmented humans in this story, when both of them are able to access feeds and information systems presumably via their brains alone? Tl;dr this is a sci-fi story but I find that it made me ask a lot of pretty interesting questions about the nature of robots and artificial intelligence, especially when juxtaposed with human emotions. And the book didn't bald-facedly ask those questions, just set things up so that readers might be provoked into asking these for themselves. That's damn good writing there.\n\nOverall, highly recommended for anyone, especially if you're a sci-fi fan. But even if you're like me and not familiar with sci-fi at all, this still remains a great read.", "text": "Mandy\n532 reviews\n26 followers\nFollow\nJuly 19, 2021\nEverything about this book was completely out of my comfort zone and not at all what I would gravitate towards, but I enjoyed it so much.

This is a 4 to 4.5* read for me, with the only thing stopping it from being a 5* simply being that I zoned out sometimes during the more sci-fi-ish bits, which was sometimes quite dense for a sci-fi layperson like me.\n\nThis is a pretty short book, but it took me probably more than half of it to figure out exactly what was going on in terms of the world, the plot, and even just the names for everything (I'm just not used to so much sci-fi and tech jargon in my books). Despite that, the book still managed to be engaging enough almost right from the start, primarily due to the the protagonist's engaging voice - it might be a Murderbot, but it's also just a really shy, introverted entity that just wants to hide behind its opaque face shield thing all day, watch the amazing amount of TV serials it's downloaded, and not have to talk to humans, especially not about its feelings. Honestly, kind of relatable.\n\nMurderbot (it doesn't really have an actual name, so we'll just call it that) is contracted out to a group of scientists and explorers, presumably in some spacefaring civilisation. It's actually a SecUnit (a security unit) that is rented out to these expeditions to protect people from hostile alien lifeforms (or other humans, I suppose). We kinda sorta get to know the scientists in Murderbot's group and they play a big role in the actual plot of this particular story, but the book being as short as it is means that we don't get the time to actually know these characters very well. While I'd love to hear more of them in the subsequent instalments, the main attraction of the story really is Murderbot and its perspective so I wouldn't say this at all detracts from the beauty of the book.\n\nThe group and Murderbot discover another expedition of scientists brutally murdered, and then it's a rollercoaster ride from there as they try to figure out who's behind that massacre before the culprits catch up with them to do the same.\n\nWhat I particularly liked about the storytelling is that, even though we get the events from Murderbot's perspective, we can't help also feeling a little distrustful of Murderbot and wondering if it might be an unreliable narrator. Does that mean I'm siding with the humans over the non-human, even though we are seeing the story through the latter's eyes? What makes Murderbot, who is only part-robot with \"organic parts\" (i.e. human bits, since it has an actual face and other human organs, which it is able to regenerate when injured or even regrow when it's completely blasted off), different from the augmented humans in this story, when both of them are able to access feeds and information systems presumably via their brains alone? Tl;dr this is a sci-fi story but I find that it made me ask a lot of pretty interesting questions about the nature of robots and artificial intelligence, especially when juxtaposed with human emotions. And the book didn't bald-facedly ask those questions, just set things up so that readers might be provoked into asking these for themselves. That's damn good writing there.\n\nOverall, highly recommended for anyone, especially if you're a sci-fi fan. But even if you're like me and not familiar with sci-fi at all, this still remains a great read.\naudiobooks\n \nebooks\n \nhumour\n \n...more\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Τεράστιες επιχειρήσεις κυριαρχούν στο σύμπαν που ασχολούνται με πλανητικές εξερευνήσεις. Οι αποστολές αυτές θα πρέπει να έχουν έγκριση από την Εταιρεία, από την οποία προμηθεύονται εφόδια και πόρους. Θεωρείται λοιπόν αναγκαίο, για την ασφάλεια της κάθε αποστολής, να υπάρχει συνοδεία από ένα ή περισσότερα Ανδροειδή Ασφαλείας, με βάση πάντα τον αριθμό των ατόμων που παίρνουν μέρος στην αποστολή. Τα ανδροειδή αυτά παρέχονται επίσης από την Εταιρεία, βάση συμβολαίου με τον ή την επικεφαλή της αποστολής. Για να μπορέσει μια ομάδα να προβεί σε εξερευνητική αποστολή, θα πρέπει να μειοδοτήσει απέναντι σε άλλες ομάδες. Οπότε όπως μπορεί κανείς να φανταστεί, η ασφάλεια μπορεί να είναι λιγάκι παραμελημένη.\n\nΗ ομάδα «Προστασία» εξερευνά έναν μακρινό πλανήτη, γνωρίζοντας πως σε κάποια άλλη ήπειρο, υπάρχει ακόμα μία ομάδα. Ξέρουν λοιπόν ότι δεν είναι μόνοι τους εκεί και πως αν χρειαστούν κάτι, μπορούν να επικοινωνήσουν μαζί τους. Την ομάδα συνοδεύει ένα Ανδροειδές Ασφαλείας, το οποίο κατά πως φαίνεται δεν είναι ίδιο με τα άλλα! Έχει χακάρει τον καθοδηγητή συμπεριφοράς του, με αποτέλεσμα να είναι πλέον ένα αυτόνομο ανδροειδές, που δεν είναι υποχρεωμένο να υπακούει σε εντολές. Το ίδιο αποκαλεί τον εαυτό του «Φονομπότ» και του αρέσει στον ελεύθερο χρόνο του να παρακολουθεί σειρές που έχει κατεβάσει από το δορυφόρο, όταν οι πελάτες θεωρούν ότι πέφτει σε αδράνεια. Δεν αισθάνεται άνετα κοντά σε ανθρώπους, αν και η συνηθισμένη ομάδα είναι καλύτερη από πολλές προηγούμενες, και έχει παρατηρήσει ότι έχει αναπτύξει συναισθήματα. Αυτό που θέλει είναι να το αφήσουν μόνο του να βρει τον εαυτό του. Όμως, όταν μια αποστολή μελών της ομάδας αποκαλύπτει σημεία ζωής στον πλανήτη, επικίνδυνα σημεία ζωής, τότε το Φονομπότ πρέπει να προστατέψει τους επιστήμονες και όλοι μαζί να ανακαλύψουν τι συμβαίνει.\n\nΚαθότι πρόκειται για νουβέλα και όχι για εκτενές μυθιστόρημα, η συγγραφέας δεν μπαίνει στον κόπο να μας εξηγήσει πολλά για τον κόσμο της σειράς. Ο αναγνώστης όμως δε δυσκολεύεται καθόλου να παρακολουθήσει τα τεκταινόμενα, και μπαίνει κατευθείαν στο ζουμί και στη δράση του βιβλίου, μέσα από τα μάτια του Φονομπότ. Έτσι έχει την ευκαιρία να δει και την οπτική του βασικού χαρακτήρα αλλά και τα συναισθήματα που βιώνει. Το πως είναι για εκείνο να είναι τόσο κοντά σε ανθρώπους. Πως αισθάνεται για την Εταιρεία αλλά και πως βλέπει το ίδιο τον εαυτό του. Έχει πολύ ενδιαφέρον το πως περιγράφει τις σχέσεις των ανθρώπων μεταξύ τους και πόσα βλέπει το ίδιο που δεν τα βλέπουν όλα τα μέλη της ομάδας.\n\nΗ σειρά προβλέπεται πως θα αποτελείται από εννέα τουλάχιστον νουβέλες, από τις οποίες έχουν εκδοθεί μέχρι στιγμής οι έξι. Για την ακρίβεια, η έκτη νουβέλα κυκλοφόρησε στα Αγγλικά μόλις τον Απρίλιο. Ανυπομονώ να διαβάσω και τα επόμενα αποσπάσματα από «Τα ημερολόγια του Φονομπότ» μιας και η συγκεκριμένη πρώτη νουβέλα ήταν μια πρώτης τάξεως αρχή!\n2021\n \nreviewcopy\n \nshelf\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Enjoyed and appreciated it once again. In fact I'm raising my grade slightly to 4.25 stars.\n\n\nNov 17, 2020\n\n4 / 4.25 stars\n\nThis novella launched Martha Wells’s Murderbot Diaries series. These books have been raved about both here and at other review sites, my social media feeds, and by one of my real life friends. I’m late to the party but I finally picked it up.\n\nThe narrator, an android “SecUnit,” has dubbed themself Murderbot. Their job is to defend and protect their leasers (Murderbot is owned by a mega-corporation referred to as “the Company”). Although the human members of the planetary research team currently leasing Murderbot don’t know it, Murderbot has hacked themself and is, to a degree, free to do as they please (consuming soap opera episodes is high on the agenda). But there’s a wrinkle: Murderbot can’t let anyone know they now have free will. If the humans learn of it and tell, Murderbot will be reprogrammed.\n\nMurderbot and the team they are guarding are on a mission that goes bad when a crater reveals itself to be the lair of a giant killer worm and one of the team members is injured and nearly dies. As the team looks into it further, it becomes evident that their data was compromised so as to lead them to think the crater was safe. Someone has it in for the team, and it is the Murderbot’s job to defend the people they refer to as “my humans.” But how can Murderbot find out who the killer it, or even who they (Murderbot) are, without being found out themself?\n\nThis was a sweet novella, but I think my expectations may have been too high due to all the buzz. Murderbot was a lovable character and I liked most of the humans working on the team. Some of the best aspects of the story were the interpersonal dynamics, with Murderbot trying to figure out how to relate to the team and the team trying to work out how to relate to Murderbot. I liked the way Murderbot’s character developed with each interaction and how their relationships with the others shifted as a result. The ending was clever and I loved it.\n\nThe mystery plot was suspenseful but ultimately not 100% there because—\n\n\n—it relied on the incompetence of the villain(s). When villains don’t act according to their self-interest or when they don’t know what their self-interest is, it makes a villain(s)’ motive shaky, and it also makes the villain(s) less of a challenge for the protagonist to defeat.\n\nAll Systems Red was also… I don’t want to say slight because it was just a novella. It was not slight for a novella at all, but I have also read novellas with more substance. This goes back to my high expectations. But it’s still looking like it will be a good series.\n2010s-decade-releases\n \n2017-releases\n \ndiversity-lgbtqiap\n \n...more\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2021-03-07", "text": "Rebecca\n76 reviews\n3 followers\nFollow\nMarch 7, 2021\nI want to be transparent here: this review will be biased. I pretty sure Murderbot is my one of my children. I had twins, so maybe, there's some sort of time-slip, fictional character meets missing triplet thing happening ... cause, it would make a lot of sense.\n\n\n\n\nBasically, one of my children is the grade school version of Murderbot. I don't know if it was purposeful, although it doesn't really matter either way, but other folks on the spectrum might find a lot to relate to here. I'm pretty sure if my kid could wear a helmet with an opaque visor, sleep in a cabinet where she could screen content all day, and have access to recordings of all her human interactions (so she could just examine them, in peace, without actually interacting IRT with people)—that'd be a wrap on any other kind of existence. God love her, she comes by it honestly (and by that, I mean, she probably inherited it from my undiagnosed ass).\n\n\n\n\nI love this character, and I'll probably plow through these novellas like a 200 episode season of Sanctuary Moon. Okay, that's not a probably; I've already almost made it to the third novella and it's been less than a week.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not going to fill this review with a bunch of details, there's really no point. It's a short read, it's great, and if you like the Imperial Radch series by Ann Leckie, you can't go wrong.\n\n\n\n\nMy only critique: I had to listen to the audiobook versions of book two and three (because I can't afford 15 bucks for a novella, and I couldn't wait 12 weeks to read the next story), and I really don't think it's the best way to experience Murderbot. That being said, I get easily distracted with audiobooks; my judgy actor side comes out, I start focusing on the performance, and instead of the paying attention to the story, I become annoyed with the choices being made. So, yeah, it might be worth the wait to just read them the old-fashioned way.\n\n\nthe-favourites-and-the-flavourful\n7 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The dark and serious cover didn't prepare me in the slightest for how humorous and amusing this journey through space would be and I loved it!\n\n\n\n\nAll System Red is a novella told through the eyes of Murderbot – a cyborg that was programmed by the Company, which organises and approves all planetary missions, to accompany those flying out. Murderbot has managed to hack its module though and is now able to operate wild and freely. Theoretically at least. In practice, the android turns out to be a pretty self-aware and socially awkward creature, only wanting to find out who he really is, which doesn't seem possible when his and a team of scientists' mission go awry.\n\nMurderbot is a wonderful character. He's so scornful in the way he thinks about humans that it's really quite funny. He's obviously there to protect the folks he's around, but he turns out to be pretty lazy, secretly spending most of his time watching soap operas and doing the bare minimum in order to keep the mission afloat. The combination of being a grumpy old piece of metal and at the same time an insufferable softie just works incredibly well.\n\nThe plot is short and sweet and leaves you wanting more. So while Murderbot is definitely the reason this is so special, the actual events happening are rather gripping as well. Things go very wrong at some point and one of the highlights of reading this was definitely when the qualified and trained team of scientists admits that their approach to solving the problems at hand was based on what they know from TV shows. With less than 200 pages, this really is too slender a volume to go stale at any point and I'm instead extremely curious to find out how things are going to develop from here and will probably jump onto the next instalment of this series in no time.\nscience-fiction\n8 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Desire to ignore the job and watch dramas, check! Pretty quick to the action, check! On to the next novella? Check!\n\n------------\n\nAll Systems Red is the first in a series of novellas titled The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells. Based on that kind of title who would have expected a story about a security robot that hacks it's own governing module so can watch tv all day instead of doing its job? I know I didn't. And boy was this story great fun.\n\nSometime in the future, the Company approves and supplies all planetary missions. As standard procedure all teams are accompanied by Company provided security androids, called SecUnits, a regulatory 1 android per 10 humans. On a distant planet, a research team is conducting surveys of the surface. Sure, there have been strange computer glitches from time to time, all perfectly normal considering programming contracts tend to go to the lowest bidder. That is right up until a neighboring mission goes dark and the scientists are determined to find out what happened.\n\nClocking in at just over 150 pages, Wells does an impressive job. The plot takes off immediately, with the researchers and Murderbot finding themselves in a highly dangerous situation they never expected. On top of that she weaves in great characterization for Murderbot. Being an android who is finds dealing with humans uncomfortable and slightly annoying, preferring instead just watch them on tv, it's highly relatable to anyone who was an awkward teen growing up or just on those days when you'd rather not deal with people. Though Murderbot tries to come across as apathetic, I think it does care underneath it all. The downside to having such limited space is the rest of the characters aren't nearly so fleshed out. That's ok though since this is Murderbot's story.\n\nWell written and entertaining, this was a satisfying short read.\nd-j-reads\n \nfbr\n \nread-in-2018\n \n...more\n7 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I wrote a review complaining about how -- except for the protagonist -- all of the characters were just names on a page, not real characters, completely without personality. I was about to post a 2-star review. Then my wife got home and I started bitching up a storm about how shitty the book was. I read it out of her Kindle library, see. And she’s like: “But it’s a bot! The story is told in the first person from the perspective of a bot. So the narrator is an anti-social, non-human construct. The characters have no personality to you because they have no personality to the bot that’s telling you the story.” My mouth snapped shut. Silence. I’m thinking: holy shit. I had to sit down. She was right. Suddenly this book that I hated unto vituperation struck me as soaring genius. Then I started thinking about the courage it took Wells as a writer to intentionally write something shitty in order to faithfully reflect the perspective of a character. OMG. I forgot to step back is what happened. I’ve felt incensed like this about a piece of literature before, but in that case I paused and asked myself: Hey, was that on purpose, maybe? And when I realized the offending particulars were indeed by design, I understood the trick of the story. I didn’t ask that question this time. There is some prejudice in me against genre lit, I think. Without that prejudice I would have taken a breath and thought it through. I need to address this blind spot.

I wrote a review complaining about how -- except for the protagonist -- all of the characters were just names on a page, not real characters, completely without personality. I was about to post a 2-star review. Then my wife got home and I started bitching up a storm about how shitty the book was. I read it out of her Kindle library, see. And she’s like: “But it’s a bot! The story is told in the first person from the perspective of a bot. So the narrator is an anti-social, non-human construct. The characters have no personality to you because they have no personality to the bot that’s telling you the story.” My mouth snapped shut. Silence. I’m thinking: holy shit. I had to sit down. She was right. Suddenly this book that I hated unto vituperation struck me as soaring genius. Then I started thinking about the courage it took Wells as a writer to intentionally write something shitty in order to faithfully reflect the perspective of a character. OMG. I forgot to step back is what happened. I’ve felt incensed like this about a piece of literature before, but in that case I paused and asked myself: Hey, was that on purpose, maybe? And when I realized the offending particulars were indeed by design, I understood the trick of the story. I didn’t ask that question this time. There is some prejudice in me against genre lit, I think. Without that prejudice I would have taken a breath and thought it through. I need to address this blind spot.

Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.\n\n\"As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure.\"\n\nThis is the first of four novellas in The Murderbot Diaries, and based on all the rave reviews I really expected to enjoy this more than I did. This is a really short book, and while I really enjoyed the first third or so, the rest was not compelling.\n\nI loved the voice at the start of this yarn. A SecUnit has hacked its governor module, and now spends its time bingeing movies, shows, books, etc. Oh, sure it has to also watch out for the people it has been assigned to protect, but that only takes so much power, so there's lots to spare. That's until things start to go wrong.\n\nThe major thing to note is that this was labeled as a young adult book by the library, and I think that might be the main problem I had with this one. I was expecting a book for adults, and while the themes explored are fun, there wasn't enough here to suck me in. Once all the action started, it was this happened, and then this, and it all felt like reading a movie script. No new ground here with rather basic scifi tropes. It's a fast read, and I was done before I got too bored. I really loved the voice in the beginning, and for that alone will round up. I do not think I will be continuing on with this series.\n2019\n \nkids-ya\n \nnovella\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

This SecUnit has examined it's functions and disapproves, it doesn't mind keeping it's clients safe, but doesn't like the fact that it may be called upon to kill things - so it calls itself Murderbot. This is an unusual SecUnit, it has hacked it's own governor chip and now doesn't have to obey commands - it has freedom. With this freedom it carries on doing the day job of keeping humans safe but now secretly downloads TV series to binge watch whenever it's left alone. Now though it has been asked to watch a bunch of researchers on an unexplored planet and things are going a bit weird. Keeping this bunch of humans safe may be harder than expected...\n\nI really enjoyed the main character (Murderbot) and the unfolding mystery. Things build to an exciting climax...and then it's over. Most of the story I would give 4 to 5 stars, but the ending felt rushed and unsatisfactory, not quite \"it was all a dream\" territory, but close \nright at the resolution the main character falls unconscious and wakes up to find everything has been sorted out. It was a bit of a disappointment as up until then the story had been great.\n\nSo my final decision is:\n\n⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ Story.

Si hubieron partes que les faltó un poquito más de desarrollo pero para desconectar un rato lo encuentro ideal, ya que es súper ligero y se lee fácil.\n\nLa historia va de Matabot una segunidad (un robot con partes orgánicas un híbrido como lo describen, de una aseguradora) que está a cargo de cuidar a un grupo de científicos que están explorando un planeta x. Esta segunidad tiene una característica peculiar, y es que se autohackeo y ahora en sus tiempo libres disfruta viendo telenovelas xd\nUn día ocurre un accidente con dos de sus clientes por causas misteriosas y desde aquí empezarán a ver que hay gato encerrado, y el pobre Matabot se verá obligado a interactuar con los humanos y pausar sus series hahsj\n\nEn personajes, el central era Matabot. Él nos contaba la historia, así que teníamos acceso a sus pensamientos y a su forma de ser. De los demás no hay mucho, no hubo trasfondo pero en parte igual se explica en qué a Matabot no le importaba y como él nos cuenta la historia ps nada 🤷🏻‍♀️ Mensah que es la líder es la que más sobresale (me dio risa su nombre xd)\n\nHubieron un par de cosas en las que me perdí pero fue por razones externas, andaba muy dispersa xd también me hubiera gustado que me hablaran un poquito más del origen de matabot, que me lo contaron pero fue muy superficial aunque en el fondo igual me gustó y la seguiré para ver como sigue, aunque no se muy bien cuando 😅\n2021\n \ncafetería\n \nciencia-ficción\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I wish I could give you a well-considered reason for this, but I'm not sure I can produce one. It seemed like the plot took over and that was a lot less interesting than this fantastic, lazy Murderbot whose character, musings, and awkward interactions with humans Wells delights us with in the previous 2/3 of the book. It's not that the plot doesn't start until the last 1/3, but that the last 1/3 feels like a perfunctory going through the motions, like just filling in the blanks for the explanations needed.\n\nMurderbot has hacked his governor module, which means he no longer has to follow his programming and his more organic/human elements influence his thinking. He's kind of like a teenager who basically just wants to watch TV. He's pretty damn funny and rather endearing. And he's all too human: \"I don't know what I want... But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.\"\n\nI am looking forward to the next book in the series. Wells sets up a fascinating world with a wide range of human-machine life forms and interactions, as well as cost-cutting corporate-control at every turn. But mostly, I just want to keep following Murderbot.\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I have a hard enough time with book series, a novella series is really a way to test my patience. My original plan was to await all of the parts publishing and then read them straight through. It happened that I have four psychological thriller arcs to read and I needed something in between that broke up the theme. Short fiction is best in this case and I was able to read this in almost one sitting. I enjoyed it so much I was tempted to go right into the next but I restrained myself and it'll be awaiting me once I've wrapped another.\n\nSecUnit/Murderbot's voice is clear, witty and wry, while sympathetic. Thoroughly enjoyable. Who knew bots just want to Netflix and chill like people? The mystery here got me and I want to know what's going on with those corporate entities and where this is all going. The team of humans in Murderbot's charge had a good showing here too and I was really glad they survived. Among all my other burning questions: What's next on RaFOSM? Because that sounds like a show I'd enjoy and should be a thing in this world.\n\nRecommended to science fiction fans who like sentient robots and AI systems.

When it would rather watch TV and would rather not be perceived.\n\nMurderbot is an apathetic if dutiful SecUnit with a hacked governor module who is more interested in entertaining itself with media than doing the job it's supposed to be programmed to do. Honestly, big mood right there.\n\nI loved Murderbot's attitude and commentary, and the way it cared about the PreservationAux team despite itself. I liked the glimpses of the larger society/world we get to see through passing remarks and plot points (The role/importance of corporations! Wormhole travel! Black market for archaeological findings? Corporate espionage!), and I'm curious as to how Murderbot will move through this world in future adventures.\n\nThere are quite a few threads throughout the book where I'd like more details and follow-up, but I think the vague nature of the world building was intentional to reflect Murderbot's disinterest in others around it (for good reason). I did find this somewhat unsatisfying, but not a major issue overall.\n\nI'd recommend this if you're in search of a fun and fast read, especially if you want to think about the humanity of somewhat snarky cyborgs.\nodyssey-book-club\n \nsci-fi-and-spec-fic\n \nshort-stories-novellas\n \n...more\n7 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The secondary characters weren't really developed (it's a short book), but their interactions with Murderbot were enough to picture their preoccupations or emotions.

It was short enough that I finished it still, but I think it's saying something that it took me almost 4 days to finish a novella. Not for me, but a refreshingly creative and beloved character by many!\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2017-10-11", "text": "Alex Bledsoe\nAuthor \n67 books\n794 followers\nFollow\nOctober 11, 2017\nTo make a hard-boiled story work, against any background, you need two things: a first-person narrator with a distinctive, preferable world-weary and cynical, voice, and a good mystery. This first \"Murderbot\" novella is therefore a working hard-boiled story. Someone has slaughtered the scientists at one planetary survey base, and the inhabitants of the other, with their security robot (aka the titular Murderbot), have to figure out who and why, while also trying to stay alive. Murderbot's unexpected musings on humanity, the society that created him, and the nature of free will provide the philosophical and thematic base of the story, but this is a locked-room (or base) mystery with a corking good supporting cast and a suspenseful ending. It bodes well for the rest of the series.\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

It features a socially awkward main character who's learning how to deal with emotions through fiction. Oh, and who's also a killer robot.⁠\n⁠\nThe series may seem like an odd recommendation from an account focused mainly on romance (Murderbot has no sex organs and is decidedly uninterested in sex - or really any physical contact with another being). That said, what is romance really about if not emotions and relationships? ⁠\n⁠\nAll Systems Red is a hilarious, poignant, and touching look at what it means to be human. Also we're very sorry for that sentence because it sounds super cheesy, and Murderbot would definitely not approve.⁠\nnon-pod\n \nromance-adjacent\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Everyone saying they relate to Murderbot… because it’s shy and just wants to watch TV? And talks like a 50 yr old man’s interpretation of a teen? Nah, that’s just a boring character. And the end of book decision it makes is totally out of left field, and the end reveal that the book is a diary to its colleague likewise makes little sense.\n\nThere’s not enough explanation for what’s going on for anything to feel real or for the plot to have any impact. I repeatedly had to re-read thinking I missed something explaining where we were, why Murderbot felt a certain way, what a technology was, who a character was… nope, just nothing there. The result is a very clunky, flat, and frustrating read.\n7 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

This is the human equivalent of sending a person to serve in multiple wars and exposing them to the trauma of having to extinguish multiple lives while constantly being exposed to the threat of being killed yourself… and then while you're still carrying all that PTSD you are placed again in a similar situation that can very well trigger your past trauma. No wonder it is self-hating and calls itself Murderbot.

On this contract, with the PreservationAux team, Murderbot is essentially navigating an awkward high school phase while possibly still at the emotional maturity of a kindergartner. The fact that it found a comforting parental figure in Dr Mensah is also interesting. The different ways that the human crew members responded to Murderbot after they've seen it without armor, looking “normal” aka humanlike, were very well-written. The general impulse in everyone EXCEPT the sole augmented human in the group was to treat Murderbot as a person – that irony is definitely not lost on me. It also triggered several conversations among the humans whether it's morally right to keep bots working for humans without giving the bots a choice about it. Of course, when Murderbot was dragged into such conversations it was excruciatingly painful for it to contemplate its place in the general scheme of things. It most definitely wasn't ready for that conversation yet as it was only just beginning to explore what existing as a person even means.\n\nI truly enjoyed this imaginative, speculative exploration of what being a newly self-aware robot might be like.

{"username": "", "date": "jsw-2025", "text": "John Warner\n964 reviews\n45 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 5, 2025\nThis quick and captivating read is the first novella in The Murderbot Diaries series, which introduces the relatable character, Murderbot, a self-aware security android. Murderbot is the novella's protagonist, a nongendered Human Bot Security Unit, called by humans as a \"SecUnit.\" However, when he malfunctioned and killed a mining team, he hacked into his governor unit to prevent this incident from reoccuring giving himself free-will; however, he felt guilty about the incident and named himself, \"Murderbot.\" Although very introverted, this android's primary interest beyond providing security for humans, is to seclude himself and binge-watch human media.\n\nThe author is effectively economical in building a world in such a small book. Political entities in the form of countries as been replaced by corporations, each vying for deep space exploration of limited resources. The characters' roles are determined by these corporate powers, whose motivations often conflict or are unknown.\n\nMurderbot is an unforgettable character, and its voice is one of the most compelling aspects of the book. Although it is technically a machine, the author imbues Murderbot with a sarcastic, self-deprecating sense of humor and a deep sense of isolation and social-awkwardness. The number of members on the crew introduced so quickly after the beginning of this book created some difficulty in keeping them straight; however, thankfully, several are simply stereotypes and not necessary for the story's enjoyment. Now, I am ready to see how this book was translated into the Apple TV series.\n\nandroid\n \naudiobook\n \njsw-2025\n \n...more\n7 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

U ovoj noveli pratimo jednog prilično asocijalnog odmetnutog Murderbota koji nam iz svoje perspektive govori o jednom događaju na planeti na kojoj se našao sa grupom naučnika. Moram reći da drugi likovi nisu preterano razrađeni, a ni bitni, ali verujem da je poenta ove prve novele da nas uvede u svet i predstavi nam lik Murderbota. Zbog toga ne treba očekivati neke kule i gradove, već se samo prepustiti našem sarkastičnom naratoru i sve će biti okej. Sa druge strane, stil pisanja mi je bio prilično prijatan i ne preterano napadan, što je učinilo da zaista jako brzo proletim kroz ovu novelu.\n\nSve u svemu - zanimljivo, ako ste kao i ja čuli za ovaj serijal i pitali se da li da ga čitate, slobodno uzmite makar ovaj prvi deo.\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Remember it's a novella, less than a hundred pages of a simple but engaging plot. I loved it -clearly, I gave it 5 stars- it's pure entertainment, endearing (in a \"I love socially awkward characters\" sense) and funny. Good read to relax and have a good time, also to read between big/complex books. Oh!, And if you having a readers block this might help you out, as I say: short, enjoyable, fun all around.\n\nTodas esas buenas recomendaciones están bien fundadas!. Hay que recordar que es una novella de menos de 100 pagínas, la trama no es muy compleja pero si atrapa. Me encantó, claramente. Es entretenimiento puro, lo socialmente incompetente de murderbot es casi... entrañable. Tiene partes que sacan carcajadas. Es una buena lectura para relajarse y disfrutar. Buena para leer entre libros complejos o lecturas largas y para recomendar a alguien con bloqueo lector ya que, como dije, es corto, disfrutable y muy divertido.\n5 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Brilliant.\n\nI've always imagined Murderbot as tiny--kind of like R2D2 for some reason--so the casting of Alexander Skarsgaard is a little jarring for me, but I see that they are giant killing machines. I've heard about this book for so long before finally picking it up. I am glad I did. And know I have another 6 books to add to my giant tbr.\n\nThis was an incredibly quick read--a true novella, telling a short and fully realized story that gives us everything we needed to establish the world and pique our interest for the rest. There's backstory aplenty to be discovered, a mystery to unfold, and emotional connections to be developed. And the narrator is such a fun, little snarky killing machine. I know just how it feels (though I read instead of watching television)--people are awful and it's better to escape into our stories.\n\nBut for someone who hates people, it was certainly willing to sacrifice itself, over and over.\nquills\n \nsf\n \nunder-225\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I enjoyed the plot, but there were some questions left unanswered purposely. I think Murderbot, despite being an Android, was relatable and funny. This novel raises the question about how human can be an ai? Can they imitate or feel human emotions? Can androids act like humans? And in the world in the novella, can androids be considered their own persons or are they properties?\nThe ending is open but I know there are sequels so I will look into that because I don't think Murderbot is going to forget about Dr. Mensah anytime soon\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2019-12-22", "text": "Amber\n709 reviews\n4 followers\nFollow\nNovember 21, 2020\nMurderbot is my hero. If you've ever felt that humans are dumb and annoying and illogical and always getting in the way and more trouble than they're worth, you'll be able to relate to Murderbot. And yet, despite Murderbot's idle fantasies of killing all the humans, Murderbot finds these particular humans not so bad (mostly) and for some reason keeps saving them instead of killing them. After all, keeping people alive is Murderbot's job, and Murderbot likes having a job to do, especially when it's the job that it was designed for, and a job that it's very, VERY good at. If only they would stop mouthing off and giving dumb orders or whatever... and they definitely should NOT be trying to make friends with Murderbot.\n\nI'm an insurance attorney, and one aspect of this story that really tickles me is that Murderbot works for what is essentially an insurance company in the most traditional sense. The original Lloyd's of London was founded to insure costly, high-risk sea voyages to distant lands, and the bond company that owns/employs Murderbot is in the exact same business... only in space. Most of what they do, from insisting that security units like Murderbot go along on the expedition, to emergency extraction services, is just loss prevention.\n\nTreat this novella like a long short story, and you can avoid the disappointment that so many readers feel when they want it to be a novel and find that it's not. After all, it has a perfect short-story ending that reminds me intensely of the ending of The Matrix.\n\nIn fact, this story reminds me of The Matrix in more than one way. Like Neo & co in The Matrix, Murderbot looks superficially human as long as it hides its inorganic parts under clothing, but is stronger and faster than any human, and has almost supernatural combat abilities, at least compared to a normal human. I keep picturing the fight scenes (and there are a lot of them) in a Matrix-style \"bullet time\" slo-mo, where Murderbot does wild stuff like wall runs, disarming multiple enemies at insane speeds, and charging an armed enemy so fast it can simply grab the weapon and point it back in the enemy's own face. Of course, Murderbot is generally trying not to draw attention to itself, so it tries to keep that sort of thing to a minimum... or at least make sure there are no surviving witnesses.\n\nAll four Murderbot novellas deserve to be collected as an omnibus (and this review is really a review of all of them), because they really are somewhat like sections of a complete novel. In each, Murderbot goes on a relatively self-contained adventure where for some reason the humans are always trying to get themselves killed (and some are trying to kill Murderbot - bad idea). Even worse, they keep doing things that force Murderbot to start examining its own personhood, when all it really wants to do is download and watch more media so it can avoid its real-life problems. (Boy, doesn't that feel familiar in 2020.) But each new adventure ties into the larger story of Murderbot, Dr. Mensah, PerservationAux, and the things that happened both in that first novella and in Murderbot's own past. In the fourth novella, things will come full circle.\n\nNote: I could die happy if I never hear the word \"shoved\" again.\n\nAudio Notes: I've heard some people say they didn't like Kevin Free's narration that much, but I thought he was quite good. He gives Murderbot just the right amount of snark (i.e., a massive amount) in its own internal narrative, but it plays things mostly low-key when interacting with the humans. You'll see that change some throughout all four novellas, as MB gets more accustomed to expressing itself in a human style. My main gripe is that too often, I found it impossible to distinguish between MB's own internal dialog and its actual verbal dialog with people around it. I've heard other audio narrators make this distinction really, really well, so I know it can be done. My other little tiny gripe is that at several points, Free insists on pronouncing \"Hostile One\" with the wrong emphasis, so it sounds like \"one who is hostile\" rather than, \"the Hostile that I've designated Number One.\"\n\nDoes it pass the Bechdel test? Yes! I'd say a solid half the characters in each book are female, and in Rogue Protocol, I think women significantly outnumbered men. Now there's a change of pace.\n\nExcuse me, I have to go vread it again.\n\nUPDATE: On my third read, my giddiness finally subsided enough to notice a couple of flaws:\n\nDescriptions of environments are... sparse, to put it kindly. But that's not as much of a flaw in a story like this, where the whole story is told from Murderbot's POV, and MB simply doesn't care about things like that, except in the sense that it relates to security. And much of the story takes place in cyberspace, as Murderbot is constantly interacting with people and other AIs through the \"feed.\" But if this were a \"fantastic things and places\" type of story rather than an \"inner monologue of an AI\" story, I'd be really annoyed by it.\n\nThere's a point in Book 2 where Murderbot alters its physical appearance to help evade scans that would identify it as a SecUnit. I wondered how it was going to deal with the simple fact that much of its innards are non-organic, and changing the way it looks on the outside probably wouldn't even defeat a simple x-ray scan of the type of we have in airports on 2020 RealEarth.\n2019\n \naction-adventure\n \naudio\n \n...more\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is sent on a mission as security for a group of explorers, when they find themselves in dire circumstances. The group takes a liking to the android, which is a new experience for it, as they see it as more human than not. Murderbot doesn't feel it's human, but as the story progresses it's actions tend to lean in that direction. A quick read space mystery, with an interesting main character, that I'm sure to visit again.\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

This is a perfect introduction into science fiction for people who want to stick their toes into the genre. I definitely can see why this won awards! The only reason this was a 4 star instead of 5 is because I don’t particularly care for shorter novels. That being said I will be continuing this series.\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}
