The tone and character voice make this series so easy to love, and it's the same as we see in her other work. As the series title suggests, this is about a Murderbot - what the manufacturers call a SecUnit - who has managed to reconfigure its own governor module though all it really does with the freedom is enjoy trashy television. Incredibly lethal, SecUnits quite rightly cause concern in those around them... and I mean, we've all been raised on fiction where robots decide it sounds like an excellent idea to 'kill all humans', so having one around for security who is armed to the teeth and perfectly calibrated for murder? Great!\n\nImagine how the humans would react if they found out that their security unit isn't under the control of its governance module, eh? \n\nWhat adds an interesting level of complexity is how human Murderbot looks, which is why it usually leaves the helmut opaque. What's also interesting is that it can feel pain and have emotions, and is mostly incredibly anxious around humans. It also carries quite a bit of distain for humans and yet also develops (or already has) quite high morals, and comes to react protectively of its humans without much time spent on the matter.\n\nAt only 144 pages so much happens in this novella. Pretty quickly the team Murderbot is hired to protect find themselves in far more danger than they bargained for. There are quite a few members in the team but Murderbot is so much more interesting than all of them, expect perhaps the leader of the expedition, Dr. Mensah, who becomes somewhat important for our protagonist. With so much packed in its hard to review without giving much away about the plot. I will say that the reason it hacked its governor module is what drives part of this novella, and all of the next. \n\nMurderbot is going to be a series of novellas, with another three expected to come out in 2018. \nfavourites\n \nread-2017\n \nread-2020\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person. Murderbot really does not like interacting with people and would rather be on her own. She really doesn't take her job seriously and is quite sarcastic. Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a short adventure, mystery on an unnamed planet.\n\nAs with all Wells novels this is a fast-paced well written story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The survey team comes under attack, people are killed, an unknown adversary. The story works as we get to learn more about our nonhuman protagonist. I really like this book and wish it was a full length novel. I am a huge fan of Martha Wells and can't wait to read more from this.\ne-books\n \nread-2017\n21 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Who can resist that!\n\nAll planetary missions must be supplied by the Company and they must rent a Company supplied SecUnit, an android security guard. The narrator of All Systems Red is one such SecUnit, but it has hacked into the governor module and is now secretly autonomous. It refers to itself as Murderbot, and it really doesn’t care about it’s job — guarding a team of scientists on a remote planet where there shouldn’t be problems anyway. Murderbot much prefers to hack into a satellite and gain access to 35,000 hours of entertainment media. This works out perfectly fine for Murderbot until a neighboring mission goes dark and their own humans may be in danger.\n\nThe plot is not what’s important about All Systems Red. Instead, this science fiction novella focuses on the inner life of it’s protagonist and narrator, Murderbot. I know what you’re thinking: this is probably one of those robot stories where there’s a lot of angst and questioning about the nature of humanity. All Systems Red isn’t like that. There’s absolutely zero angst, and Murderbot finds humans awkward and slightly annoying. It says it likes fictional humans better than real humans, which is entirely relatable.\n\nMurderbot’s voice was far and away the best thing about All Systems Red. It’s hilarious! I was seriously laughing out loud while reading this. Robots with feelings are the best sort of robots, even if in this case our robot narrator is anti-social and largely apathetic. Although, Murderbot may be a bit less apathetic than it seems. While it professes to be horrified by the humans clumsy attempts to befriend it, it does seem to care about them beneath it all. As well as being astonishingly funny, it’s also quite heart warming.\n\nI loved All Systems Red so much. It will undoubtedly end up being one of the best science fiction stories I read all year. Thank goodness Martha Wells is writing a sequel! I desperately need more.\n\nOriginally posted on The Illustrated Page.\n2017-releases\n \nother-world\n \nscience-fiction\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Hence, Murderbot — although our Murderbot has disabled the system that they think caused them to do that, and manages to take pretty good care of its little group of prospectors while also mainlining a ton of soaps and whatever other entertainment programs come its way.\n\nI found it all very entertaining, but there was a more serious aspect, too: the Murderbot’s misanthropic attitude and even anxiety about interacting with humans, especially without its suit and opaque helmet on as a buffer. Thus the interactions with the team were a little sad as well as funny — if not sad, perhaps the right term would be invested with pathos, especially as they interact more and more with their employers (contractors? not sure quite what the term should be).\n\nI was a little disappointed by the ending, leaving behind the established team. Obviously there’s gonna be more Murderbot, but… with a new cast otherwise? Boo. I was just getting to like ’em.\n\nReviewed for The Bibliophibian.\nrobots\n \nshort-stories-novellas\n \nspeculative-fiction\n15 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

It's starts slow as it introduces you to the players and the game, even the tech is revealed relatively slowly and in small quantities, with no big info dumps.\n\nMurderbot is interesting. Is it a cyborg? These SecUnits are part machine, part organic parts derived from cloning, but obviously with personalities and thoughts of their own. This is proved by the fact that they don't just run on programming, but that their own impulses and actions have to be controlled or curbed by the governor module.\n\nIt's like a more versatile, upgraded, slightly less squicky version of Halva from The Ship Who Sang. Though being grown in a test tube probably isn't wonderful, I think it's a little better than being a stunted human body encased in a metal column implanted in a spaceship.\n\nWhere does one's humanity stop or start? Human, cyborg, self aware synthetic being?\n\nThis was fun, Murderbot had their own thoughts and plans and wants, and entertainment obsessions and anxieties and I'd enjoy reading more. Case in point, naming itself Murderbot.\n\nPS I also love that Murderbot is never prescribed a gender, seeing as they have no genitalia, and are free of gender constraints.\ndystopia\n \nscience-fiction\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

I'm really glad I did because I didn't remember anything.\n_____\n\nAll Systems Red is a story about a team surveying a new planet told from the perspective of a security robot.\n\nMurderbot's perspective is a lot of fun. The robot is a hacked version of what it's supposed to be, so instead of being focused on the contract/clients, it's more focused on watching television shows. It's sassy and has as carefree an attitude as a robot can have.\nThe other characters served their purpose in the story. They filled the reader in on world building information and gave Murderbot a contract/purpose. Other than that, they were just sort of there. This is usually a negative, however for the purpose of this story it works and allows the focus to be placed on Murderbot.\n\nThe exploration of a new planet is one of my all time favourite science fiction plot lines. The exploration in this story was decent. The \"mystery\" is satisfactory, however I would have liked to discover more information, but that wasn't the purpose of the story. The focus of the story is on Murderbot as a \"person\" rather than what's going on around it.\n\n\nOverall, All Systems Red was a unique novella that sets up future stories that I will be definitely checking out.

{"username": "", "date": "2019-reads", "text": "Liz (Quirky Cat)\n4,977 reviews\n84 followers\nFollow\nAugust 31, 2023\nAll Systems Red is about an android (partially synthetic, partially organic) that is charged with protecting a scientific team on a new and relatively unknown planet. Having no name of its own, it names itself Murderbot, which makes sense in a weird sort of way. It took me less than two hours to read, so it doesn't require much time investment (Though I would have loved for it to be longer).\n\nMurderbot is different from all the other SecUnits. It figured out how to hack its way to freedom. Now, he doesn't have to follow orders or install updates automatically. Instead, it can watch all the crummy TV he wants. It pretends to do everything it was programmed to do so nobody catches on, but it isn't required.\n\nHuman interaction is awkward for Murderbot. It knows it's not one of them, and they know that, making it difficult for MurderBot to move past it. Despite this, MurderBot grows truly attached to certain crew members it's protecting. Everything about the interactions it has is oddly...human. It's endearing.\n\nMy description here has barely scratched the surface of all that makes MurderBot so amazing; please trust me on this! I have read (and listened) to this whole series at least a dozen times at this point...realistically that count is a whole lot higher. \n\nIt is safe to say that MurderBot has stolen my heart. The characters and the series live rent-free in my mind. In fact, it recently occurred to me that MurderBot is to me what Sanctuary Moon is to MurderBot. That gave me a good chuckle. Enjoy!\n\nHighlights:\nCyberpunk meets Solarpunk\nRogue Android/SecUnit\nSarcastic Characters\nSpace Adventures\n\nGraphic Audio Review:\n\nIn case you haven't heard the news, Graphic Audio recently released their production of All Systems Red, the first novella in the MurderBot Diaries series (one of my favorite series of all time). Naturally, I pre-ordered the shit out of that. Since its release, I've listened to it three times. Yes, I know.\nAt first, listening to the Graphic Audio version of All Systems Red was strange. I'm used to hearing Kevin R. Free's voice, especially for MurderBot. This made me think I didn't like it, or at least I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.\n\nThen I listened to it again. It works; it really does! David Cui Cui portrays MurderBot in a slightly different manner than Kevin R. Free. The sarcasm is less of a constant presence. However! His voice helps to highlight other elements of MurderBot's character (such as their more atypical nature).\n\nSpeaking of casting and characters, I think the voice for Ratthi (Zeke Alton) is my favorite. Mensah's voice (Khaya Fraites) sounded a little younger than I expected, but otherwise, I don't have any complaints.\n\nIf you're on the fence about trying All Systems Red by Graphic Audio, I would highly suggest trying it. It's a fun listen!\n\nYou Can Also Find Me On:\nQuirky Cat's Fat Stacks | Quirky Cat's Comics | The Book Review Crew | Monkeys Fighting Robots | Storygraph | Bookhype | Bookstagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Reedsy\n2017-reads\n \n2018-reads\n \n2019-reads\n \n...more\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Review cross-posted to my blog here: http://www.firstsightsecondthoughts.n...All Systems Red is the first novella in the Murderbot Diaries series, which is a name that is just full of yes. I was a little disappointed when I found out that this was a novella and not a full length novel, but I’m trying to make a mental adjustment there. Rather than wishing there was more, I’d like to try to appreciate that the writer wrote the story to the length it should be, rather than padding it out to make it novel-length when the plot for it isn’t there.Murderbot, the protagonist of the story, is a programmed cyborg Security Unit who has figured out how to override his own governor module and can ignore his orders. He’s accompanying a survey team on a distant planet, as a safety precaution mandated by the Company that arranges the surveys. Of course, he’d much rather sit around and watch entertainment programs all day instead of actually go out and fight off the enormous worm creatures that seem to be a bit of a surprise in this region. Over the course of the story, Murderbot and the crew get signs that all is not quite as it seems.So, I mean, I am all about stories where robots learn how to feel emotions and how to love. Apparently I am also all about stories where socially anxious robots learn how to tolerate and eventually care about their human crew. As soon as Murderbot identifies them as “his humans”, it’s all over for me. The “reluctant hero” doesn’t typically do it for me, but when it’s a robot who just wants to watch his goddamn anime sitcom shit, apparently I am all in. I love Murderbot. Murderbot is delightful and relatable and fun. …And just the fact that he calls himself Murderbot makes everything so much better.All of the individual facets of the plot and setting and characters here are things I tend to like – even beyond Murderbot’s character growth. Space intrigue, gross alien monsters, dodgy unethical mega-conglomerate companies, a crew of found family who are super competent at their jobs. These are all very solid, and they’re very well handled within this story. I haven’t read anything else by Wells, but this is clearly not her first rodeo, and I’m definitely interested to see what else she’s written.The big synopsis for this novella I tend to see describes it as Westworld meets the Culture books by Iain M Banks. I haven’t read those, but I think it’s also reasonable to say that it feels a little like Westworld meets Dune, except the people here don’t hate each other as much as they hate each other in Dune. I mean, you know, desert world sand worms. There’s gonna be a Dune comparison. And also robots awakening to sentience, there’s gonna be a Westworld comparison, at least here in 2017 – god knows Westworld is not the first or last to do it and do it well.This book has a great balance of seriousness and humor as well. I think it’s easy (well, for a given value of easy) to do one or the other, but striking the proper balance is tricky, and I very much appreciate books that manage it. The tension and drama surrounding the Company and the rogue SecUnits, and the discovery of Murderbot’s sentience is always met with the perfectly timed snarky remark from Murderbot, or a quip about his favorite serial drama, or something along those lines. It’s like if Marvin the Paranoid Android from H2G2 was not clinically depressed, and just super socially awkward.The human characters are great too, as are Murderbot’s frank assessments of their personalities and relationships. Seeing through Murderbot’s eyes gives a great introduction to them, as we see them being the first crew he’s actually given a damn about, and why. I don’t know if any of them would be particularly interesting as viewpoint characters themselves, but they make fascinating subjects from our secondhand standpoint through Murderbot’s perspective. Given how this first installment ends, I’ll be really interested to see who he meets in the next book and what he thinks of them.And I am so happy that “Murderbot Diaries #1” means that there will be more. Wells has said as much on her social media, and it seems like this is selling/rating well, so I don’t know why there wouldn’t be more. I don’t know how much more, but I am definitely excited for more Murderbot. I want to follow his journey as he learns how to feel, to think, to figure out who he is, and possibly… how to love, the most important robot story of all.", "text": "Jennifer\n79 reviews\n29 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 3, 2017\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\nShow full review\nLike\nComment"}

Yes, it's a construct, and it's agender and ace because that's how it (they?) was constructed, but it's definitely a person, and the gender thing and the aceness aren't there to suggest that it's something that makes it/them less human, or to mark the Otherness.\n\nOf course, all that isn't particularly relevant to the plot, apart from when Murderbot fast forwards through sex scenes in TV shows episodes because they're boring. Most of the time Murderbot is engulfed in a) exasperation, b) social anxiety caused by the inherent awkwardness of interacting with members of the expedition, or c) the profound need to be left in peace to watch TV shows. VERY RELATABLE. Also, solving the mystery and keeping everyone alive.\n\nI was just informed that the next book in the series is in the making and it makes me very, very happy.\nhumour\n \nsf-cyberpunk\n5 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

But now the research group he's in charge of protecting starts having trouble at first it seems like information may have just been left out but they soon realize it was sabotage and the planet they are researching on has Secrets another group doesn't want anyone finding out then when murderbot gets hacked and is commanded to kill his humans he resists since he has no governor. And does not have to follow commands, soon the group learns of this and they do not know if he's actually on their side or not. But once he starts killing other Bots to protect them they realize he's trying to protect them and that's how things play out in this short story not bad but not great I can say I did not like the ending but that was just my opinion.\n2017\n \nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-06-03", "text": "April\n964 reviews\n9 followers\nFollow\nJune 3, 2017\nThis is a lovely gem of a novella. I read it and then reread it again immediately, just so I could continue to be with the very compelling main character, who has a wonderfully intriguing viewpoint. Our SecUnit (a kind of cyborg clone) is in the middle of a boring planetary survey with its clients, about whom it knows nothing. Why should it? To them, it is just equipment the survey company requires them to bring along to increase its profit and cut costs. In just 150 short easy pages, I grew to care a lot about this bot. It loves watching entertainment videos, saying, \"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\" (p.9) Starting with its override of a automatic command not to save one of the humans from being eaten by a local monster, the bot gradually gets drawn in to protecting \"my humans.\" The mystery is why the humans are being targeted, and one of the things I love about this book is that the answer doesn't fit your standard planetary expedition adventure. Another reason to love this book is that Wells is a master at expressing the feelings of an outsider who is so lonely they don't even want to try to join humanity. That sounds depressing, but this bot is great! Favorite quotes: \"So, I'm awkward with actual humans....I know I'm a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous.\" (p.20) \" \"I got my helmet on and opaqued it. The relief was intense....'I love you armour, and I'm never leaving you again.'\" (p.95) From start to the finish, which was again non-standard (thank you, Wells!), I loved this adventure and the characters.

Watching the outcast lead character win the approval and acceptance of his companions, only to prove that he is still an outcast by nature is oddly satisfying.

Most tales about sentient cyborgs/robots seem to assume that, given the chance, they'll go rogue and kill everyone. Not Murderbot. All he wants to do is watch his downloaded vids of TV shows. Humans are a nuisance, as they keep doing stupid things and have to be saved. The main storyline is a good action/adventure tale of a planetary expedition running afoul of a rival corporation wanting to kill all the other teams wanting to develop the planet.

Apparently someone has hacked the information databases about the new planet they're surveying and left out some pretty vital info. Who did this? Why? And how do they not die while trying to answer those questions? That's the main through plot and it's well done.

Wells seemed careful to stay away from gender markers, but somehow I read Murderbot as female.\n\nA male reader was selected for the audiobook, howsomever, and he does well enough. 11/23\nsf-fantasy\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-07-09", "text": "Scotoma\n47 reviews\n1 follower\nFollow\nJuly 9, 2025\nThis is one of the best science fiction pieces I read last year (I read it when it came out and re-read just recently) and while I haven’t read much science fiction recently overall, I still would think it would have been among the strongest pieces overall. It’s a novella, a couple of pages shy of a 100 pages, and yet it feels packed with content.\n\nEverything is told from the viewpoint of Murderbot, a robot, or android would be the better description, that has been hired out by her company to work as a bodyguard to keep a group of scientists safe on a mission to a new world, and then things go south very fast. What helps our intrepid murderbot is that it has hacked its own control module and is fully in control of itself, which is not how things should be.\n\nOn a past mission, as far as it knows, it went rogue, killed lots of people it was supposed to keep safe, then its memory was purged and the murderbot repurposed. After all, it’s not a being, but a piece of equipment to most people in this corporate future (only a few enclaves treat SecBots like their own being, and even they require guardians, which in the words of Murderbot, is a nicer word for owner).\n\nI say it since Murderbot doesn’t have any gender or sex, although to me Murderbot feels more like a her than a he (which might be due to being written by a woman and I automatically assigned her gender to that of Murderbot, even If I shouldn’t have). That said, the way Murderbot is written, it has aspects that intentionally make it hard to pinpoint as either gender, which I think is a really neat trick, as it makes sure you’re always aware just how much it is different from humans.\n\nAnd yet, Wells managed to infuse Murderbot with so much humanity in the few pages we have, that its hard not to empathize with her. It just wants to do its job, not getting into the confusing social aspects of a tightly-knit group of human explorers or it’s own feelings over its own humanity. Murderbot knows exactly what and what it isn’t, and doesn’t want to think too much about these things and instead prefers to binge-watch hours upon hours of TV serials like the most ardent Netflix-addict.\n\nThis obviously doesn’t work out when an ‘evil’, hidden surveyor group tries to kill Murderbot’s charges and it has to bring all it has to bear to survive and keep it’s people alive. And this makes it clear to it at the end, that hiding from its own humanity is something it can’t do anymore because humans are all around, but that it doesn’t want to be controlled by anybody, not even those it considers friends.\n\nWhat makes this work so well is the combined mix of an action-packed survival story, the mystery of the evil surveyor group and how fast the threat gets ramped-up from random glitches to murderous intent and the seamlessly integrated exploration of a believable android trying to grapple with its own existence. After nearly a 100 years of stories on androids and robots, I would have thought this topic would have been mined until nothing is left to do, but to be honest, this novella just showed me there’s so much more and we have hardly begun to explore thinking about this deep enough. But this will suffice for now.\nprose\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Novellas can be a tricky thing. They’re not full length books, but they can sometimes still demand the same price. All Systems Red comes in at just 150 pages, so it’s a quick read, but despite the length of the book, the true importance is the impact of the story. That’s where this one shines. All Systems Red stands out. The style and narrative of the story, the voice of the main character, it grips you right from the start and compels you to keep going. There’s humor, there’s action and there’s mystery as this sci-fi tale pokes it’s head into the waters of a very interesting universe. It’s one where hi-tech gadgets are curbed by businesses cutting corners to save costs. A place where planetary explorers get in over the heads with vicious lifeforms and deadly technology. But most of all, it’s a story about a murderbot who just wants to watch tv.\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.” And so the book begins with the main character. A robot. A murderbot. Murderbot doesn’t have a name. It’s official designation is simply SecUnit, short for security unit, and it’s tasked with the security of a scientific team on a far off planet. Murderbot is just one cog in the wheel of futuristic commerce. Corporations sell out shares of prospect worlds to parties interested, who in turn rent or buy all the equipment needed to explore that world, which includes security units like Murderbot. Part machine and part cloned human, Murderbot has no gender and, theoretically, no freedom. However, thanks to a hacked governor module, Muderbot has quite a lot of freedom. In most stories, that freedom would lead to a robot killing its masters to seek its freedom. In this story, Murderbot ends up travelling a very different path, which is what makes it fun.\n\nNow I don’t want to spoil the story, so suffice to say Murderbot goes on an adventure on this alien world with a team of scientists and it leads to plenty of action and mystery. Yet the key that glues it all together is the humor. Murderbot’s peculiar personality leads to some very fun quirks that makes the story so enjoyable. Murderbot knows it’s a piece of junk made by a corporation using the cheapest parts to maximize profits. This in turns leads to some self-deprecating humor. On the other hand, you have this extremely advanced machine in comparison to what we actually have in reality. Murderbot has a true artificial intelligence and is capable of making its own decisions and having its own wants and desires. So what does an AI do? It watches tv. That right there is hilarious.\n\nWhile novellas can be a hard sell, All Systems Red is a must read story. Seriously, this is a sci-fi story you should check out. It’s fun, unique, quirky, and a pure joy to read. This story in itself is rather self-contained, however there is another book on the way.

{"username": "", "date": "Martha Wells’ All Systems Red won me over almost immediately. I began the first page with reservations and by page three I was charmed into complete immersion.\n\nI’m not kidding when I say I read this book in almost one sitting. I was so comfortable in this book, so reluctant to surface from my reading bubble, at one point I tried to get my cat to flip the light switch for me – the sun had gone down and I couldn’t keep reading without the light, but I didn’t want to stop even for a minute. That said, this is absolutely an easy “one sitting” read.\n\nThe characters are full and entertaining, the central concept as clearly brought to life as is the world Wells has created. Honestly, I cannot believe how much emotion and life Martha Wells effortlessly fit into 150 pages. I’ve referred before to authors whose “magic” lies in this accomplishment or that skill, and to me this is Wells’ skill: she puts not only a fully realized narrative and cast of characters in a tiny package, but creates what feels like a living, breathing world and narrative arcs readers will invest in into a travel sized snack of a book!\n\nOne of the things I watch out for as I’m reading is how quickly I can get “into” a new book. This is partly down to author’s style and voice, and partly down to how quickly the author introduces me to the characters, the story, and the universe. I fell into All Systems Red effortlessly.

I began the first page with reservations and by page three I was charmed into complete immersion.\n\nI’m not kidding when I say I read this book in almost one sitting. I was so comfortable in this book, so reluctant to surface from my reading bubble, at one point I tried to get my cat to flip the light switch for me – the sun had gone down and I couldn’t keep reading without the light, but I didn’t want to stop even for a minute. That said, this is absolutely an easy “one sitting” read.\n\nThe characters are full and entertaining, the central concept as clearly brought to life as is the world Wells has created. Honestly, I cannot believe how much emotion and life Martha Wells effortlessly fit into 150 pages. I’ve referred before to authors whose “magic” lies in this accomplishment or that skill, and to me this is Wells’ skill: she puts not only a fully realized narrative and cast of characters in a tiny package, but creates what feels like a living, breathing world and narrative arcs readers will invest in into a travel sized snack of a book!\n\nOne of the things I watch out for as I’m reading is how quickly I can get “into” a new book. This is partly down to author’s style and voice, and partly down to how quickly the author introduces me to the characters, the story, and the universe. I fell into All Systems Red effortlessly. I was not only hooked, but fully invested in the characters and completely oriented and acclimatized in the universe before I had time to realize what was happening to me.\n\nAll in all, Martha Wells put together a romp of a tale in All Systems Red, and I cannot wait to read more.

But mostly, I liked the main character--\"Murderbot.\" Unlike many recent AI books and movies, this sentient machine/cyborg isn't seeking selfhood and independence for some grand ambitions, but rather out of a surly anti-authoritarianism and boredom. Mostly, Murderbot wants to be left alone to watch its store of entertainment media, and when it has to interact with humans, it's with the greatest sarcasm:\n\n\"Confession time: I don't actually know where we are... I hadn't looked at the maps yet and I'd barely looked at the survey package... The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\" (p. 35)\n\nI definitely want to spend more time with Murderbot, which is good, as I just read that several more books are forthcoming in this series.\n2023\n \naudiobook\n \nsci-fi\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The resolution is classic Niven or Heinlein or Pohl or even Hammett, using clues given in the body of the story.\n\nThe best term I can think of for this book is \"cute.\" And it is, in an extreme sort of way, if one can view violent dismemberment and organic punctures as the willingness to be lovable. But there it is, Murderbot qualifies as both cute and lovable.\n\nComparing this with another non-human bot in Ancillary Justice, I prefer cute to stolid. There is enough here to want to read the next book in the series. 4.25 stars.\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

However, when things start to go sour on the survey it is on, the team that it is supposed to be protecting figures out that it's more person than robot, and now poor Murderbot has to contend with people being concerned about its feelings...

In distant, spare faring future, where corporate super entities rule most of space, Murderbot is a security unit, or SecUnit for short, for one of the corporate-politico entities that equip smaller entities with all the equipment they'd need for an exploratory mission - for a price, of course. On one such mission, Murderbot is attempting to catch up on Sanctuary Moon, their favourite serial, when a neighbouring mission goes dark - and they could be next! Full of danger, fights, world building and Murderbot's snarky tone.

Lindström\nAuthor \n1 book\n13 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 14, 2022\nMurderbot is a rogue SecUnit, a rent-a-bot that's ~50% machine and ~50% organic matter. It could basically pass for a human with technical modifications. Murderbot is rogue in that it's hacked the module that sends it orders, so that it doesn't have to follow those orders if it doesn't want to. This means it can spend most of its missions ignoring all the boring stuff and catching up on soaps. Sadly, the current mission looks to be turning into a complicated one. Will Murderbot find enough peace and quite to catch up on its stories? Stay tuned to find out!\n\nAs a main character, Murderbot has pros and cons. I like how detached it was, while at the same time got a little bored myself with some moments because Murderbot wasn't too invested in them. I hardly remember which of the human characters was which (with one exception) because Murderbot wasn't too interested in them as people (with one exception). That said, the mystery drove the plot forward and there weren't any \"unnecessary\" scenes. Really liked Murderbot as a character! Now that it has been established as a personality, I think its next adventure will be even more interesting than its first. Also, that the whole book was written as a transmission that Murderbot is sending out thankfully paid off at the end. Will be picking up the next book in the series.\nauthors-i-follow\n \nmystery\n \nscience-fiction\nLike\nComment"}

The narrator, who calls itself \"Murderbot,\" is a fantastic character, which is ironic since it's supposed to be a soulless robot. This is a very funny (but not in a slapstick sort of way) and very well-written piece of science fiction, with a lot of action and great, well-drawn characters.

I wanted to explore some anomalies I’d noticed through the feed.” He gestured to me. “This unit was already a rogue. It has a hacked governor module.”\n\nOn the entertainment feed, this is what they call an “oh shit” moment.\n\nThrough the security cams, I watched them be confused, but not alarmed, not yet.\n\nPin-Lee, who had apparently just been digging around in my local system, folded her arms. Her expression was sharp and skeptical. “I find that difficult to believe.” She didn’t add “you asshole” but it was in her voice. She didn’t like anybody questioning her expertise.\n\n“It doesn’t have to follow our commands; there is no control over its behavior,” Gurathin said, getting impatient. He didn’t like anybody questioning his expertise either, but he didn’t show it like Pin-Lee did. “I showed Volescu my evaluations and he agrees with me.”\n\nI had a moment to feel betrayed, which was stupid. Volescu was my client, and I’d saved his life because that was my job, not because I liked him. But then Volescu said, “I don’t agree with you.”\n\n“The governor module is working, then?” Mensah asked, frowning at all of them.\n\n“No, it’s definitely hacked,” Volescu explained. When he wasn’t being attacked by giant fauna, he was a pretty calm guy. “The governor’s connection to the rest of the SecUnit’s system is partially severed. It can transmit commands, but can’t enforce them or control behavior or apply punishment. But I think the fact that the Unit has been acting to preserve our lives, to take care of us, while it was a free agent, gives us even more reason to trust it.”\n\nOkay, so I did like him.\n\nGurathin insisted, “We’ve been sabotaged since we got here. The missing hazard report, the missing map sections. The SecUnit must be part of that. It’s acting for the company, they don’t want this planet surveyed for whatever reason. This is what must have happened to DeltFall.”\n\nRatthi had been waiting for a moment to lunge in and interrupt. “Something odd is definitely going on. There were only three SecUnits for DeltFall in their specs, but there were five units in their habitat. Someone is sabotaging us, but I don’t think our SecUnit is part of it.”\n\nWith finality, Bharadwaj said, “Volescu and Ratthi are right. If the company did order the SecUnit to kill us, we would all be dead.”\n\nOverse sounded mad. “It told us about the combat module, it told us to kill it. Why the hell would it do that if it wanted to hurt us?”\n\nI liked her, too. And even though being part of this conversation was the last thing I wanted to do, it was time to speak for myself.\n\nI kept my eyes closed, watching them through the security camera, because that was easier. I made myself say, “The company isn’t trying to kill you.”\n\nThat startled them. Gurathin started to speak, and Pin-Lee shushed him. Mensah stepped forward, watching me with a worried expression. She was standing near me, with Gurathin and the others gathered in a loose circle around her. Bharadwaj was farthest back, sitting in a chair. Mensah said, “SecUnit, how do you know that?”\n\nEven through the camera, this was hard. I tried to pretend I was back in my cubicle. “Because if the company wanted to sabotage you, they would have poisoned your supplies using the recycling systems. The company is more likely to kill you by accident.”\n\nThere was a moment while they all thought about how easy it would have been for the company to sabotage its own environmental settings. Ratthi began, “But surely that would—”\n\nGurathin’s expression was stiffer than usual. “This Unit has killed people before, people it was charged with protecting. It killed fifty-seven members of a mining operation.”\n\nWhat I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.\n\n\n3 1/2 stars\naction\n \ncrime\n \nhumor\n \n...more\n26 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

This Vantablack comedy crosses the ethos of 'Star Trek' with contemporary corporate culture which results in some hilarious deadpan comedy. If 'Not giving a shit' was an Olympic event then 'Murderbot', the central character, would be guaranteed a podium finish if not the Gold Medal. The author uses this to great effect, many details about the setting are kept from the reader simply because Murderbot could never be bothered reading the relevant files. Despite this the story hangs together and avoids descending into silliness - the characters act in a sensible manner throughout the story. At a mere 144 pages this is a rather slim volume but it means there is no padding. If you like your stories tight and humour dark this book is definitely for you.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-07-18", "text": "Matt\n135 reviews\n4 followers\nFollow\nJuly 18, 2017\nFirst the Good: This book is about a security robot who calls himself \"Murderbot\" has managed to hack his governor module that compels him to follow orders and his programming. While this in itself is not unique, the hook is Murderbot now has free will, but he (or her since it has not sex) is still a bot, so it has to decide how to interact with people, not somehting it has much experience in.\nThis has resulted in it being an introvert and extremely awkward around humans. Think of it as a highly weaponized, murdering, rogue robot with a touch of autism, that also loves soap operas, but with a heart of gold. What I also, appreciated is the book doesn't go into a whole origin story narrative about how it managed to hack it's governor and \"awaken\", etc. We've seen that before in other books.\n\nNow the Bad: Mostly it comes down to the book is thin; in many ways. First, even calling it a \"book\" is not really accurate. At under 150 pages it's really a novella at best, or even a short story. Admittedly, the author's Goodreads page describes it a such but I didn't notice. Because of this it's thin in other ways too such as character development, world building, even an interesting plot. The whole thing seemed rushed and glossed over somehow. Even the generic title \"All Systems Red\" sounds like it was just made up at the last minute. In the end I felt like I was shown a pretty cool concept, but was cheated out of an experience. It does appear to be the first book in a series and the main character certainly has potential. If the next in the series has more meat to it I would give it a chance.\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

(Murderbot is not really an android, but that comes closest to what they are.)\n\nI've been reading a lot of horror and dark fiction lately, completely on purpose, but I realized I needed a bit of a break. Enter Murderbot. This series has gotten tons of good press in the sci-fi world, and if you read that stuff you have probably heard of it. If you have not, here's the elevator pitch. A security android (sorta) hacks itself so as to no longer be under the control of the company that owns it. Instead of waging war on those who have done it wrong, it decides to continue doing its job, at least half-assedly, and watch a bunch of shows. This is going pretty well, until the group it's contracted to provided security for is sabotaged and Murderbot has to save them. While doing this, it discovers it kinda likes these particular humans, and would like them to not die.\n\nThe best thing about this re-read, for me, is comparing this Murderbot with the Murderbot of later books. Murderbot remains anxious and grouchy, but it's so, so much worse in this book. Murderbot is still used to hiding behind an opaque helmet, so having to talk to people face to face is deeply uncomfortable for it. At one point, it has to go face the wall to have a conversation. Another thing that's great is watching Murderbot improve at its job. It's a security expert, but it says many times that the company only cares about its clients to the extent that it would have to pay insurance on them. The company is also incredibly cheap, and Murderbot often comes up with ideas based more on the shows it watches than the actual training it has had downloaded to it. (Also, I hope no one finds me calling Murderbot 'it' upsetting. Murderbot has no gender or sexual orientation, and, at least at this point, doesn't really think of itself as a person. There's probably a good case to made for using 'they' pronouns for Murderbot, but I don't think that actually happens in the story. The story is in first person, and most people that Murderbot meets either believe it to be a thing, or they call it some alias it has picked.)\n\nAnyway, read these books, y'all. They're fun, smart, and Murderbot is a wonderful mess of neuroses trying to find its place, and time to watch its shows, in a world that's mostly afraid of it.\naliens-and-outerspace\n \ncrime-and-thriller\n \nfuturism\n \n...more\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot's such a fun, and--yeah--relatable character. I'm looking forward to continuing on with the rest of the novellas in this series.\n\n(My mini-review from the first read is below the *.)\n\n*\n\nThe cyborg protagonist of \"All Systems Red\" is hired on, or rented, to act as security for a small survey team exploring a new planet. The autopilot on the team's transport is sabotaged while they are exploring an anomaly on the survey map, leading to an investigation into who might have done it, and why.\n\n\"Murderbot\" reminds me somewhat of Breq in the Imperial Radch trilogy, especially in how its interactions with humans, and its variance from others of its kind, open up questions of what \"identity\" means. Its lackadaisical attention to detail, its frequent criticisms of how cheap the company that created it is, and its awkwardness with the crew, made this story surprisingly charming and funny.\n\nThe ending was perfect for a novella, closing off this chapter for Murderbot, and making me anxious to see where it goes to next.\n\nThis was my second Martha Wells (the other was City of Bones quite a while ago), and I'm glad there are plenty more yet to read.

They are controlled by governor chips that limit them and reign them in.\n\nSecBots don't care much for Humans and most Humans don't have much time for SecBots. The SecBot in All Systems Red doesn't like them much either. Not so much hate, more apathetic disdain, it has also managed to hack it's own governor chip. A fact it hasn't seen fit to mention to any Humans. The only thing stopping our SecBot (Who calls itself MurderBot!) from doing whatever it likes (Mostly binge watching Sanctuary Moon on a future equivalent of Netflix) is having to pretend it's still a slave to the man.\n\nThat's pretty much where this novella starts - and all I want to say about the story is that It is awesome. My only criticism is that it's not long enough! I need more MurderBot in my life!\n\nIf I was an artificial construct - I would be just like Murderbot! ... Maybe. ;)\n\n2018-hugo-reading-list\nLike\nComment"}

It almost felt as if this was supposed to be a short story or started as a short story, and the treatment ended up getting expanded beyond its initial premise.

A broken one, in fact. Or as it likes to call itself, A Murderbot. This is a fast read. And the author, who has built fantasy worlds like no others before, takes you to another planet, to a survey team, where conspiracy threatens the lives of the humans Murderbot finds itself caring about.

The narrator, the self-named (but never outloud) \"Murderbot\", is a self-aware security android which has secretly freed itself from human control, and helps to protect these humans until it can get off the planet.\n\nWhy did I read it?\nSo many people recommended it on twitter. So many.\n\nFavourite idea/part?\nMurderbot's personality. Its obsessive love of entertainment programming. Its reluctant love of certain humans. Its snark and cleverness. Oh yeah, and its immense desire to just be left alone so it can finally watch it's shows.\n\nOverall:\nI'm so happy I found this. It's only a short read, (2 hours maybe) but well worth your time. The plot is fast-moving and interesting, while the characters are diverse and capable and worth paying attention to.

This was a subject that could have been done in many different tones, and the author forewent slapstick comedy or scifi-noir for a more straight treatment that asked many interesting questions and had a fair bit to say on scifi's old \"how do we treat The Other?\" trope. The main character's grumpy and introverted internal monologue was fun to listen to, and you rooted for it through the whole thing, as it evolved and changed and began to have Opinions that it couldn't just hide while it pretended to be a good little nonsentient. The worldbuilding was secondary to the character's arc, but was still well-done. The tension was well-played and kept me reading through the whole thing, and I was not expecting the very fitting denouement - the murderbot refused to conform to the genre's expectations right to the end, and for that I applaud it.\nowned-ebook\n \nsci-fi\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Po ugovoru, grupici je dodijeljen ne pretjerano naoružan robot-čuvar SecUnit, ali ovaj je opičen po tome jer je 'po skrivečki' hakirao svoj upravljački modul tako da može biti neovisan o zakrpama i raznim downloadima koje mu centralni sustav šalje jer želi više vremena za sebe, istražiti što želi i slično. Osim toga, hakirao je satelit tako da može skidati, pohraniti i gledati mnoštvo tv serija i filmova u samoći jer više voli fiktivne likove nego stvarna ljudska bića.\n\n\"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As an heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\"\n\nRobot naziva sebe Murderbotom, jer je negdje u prošlosti imao glitch u svom upravljačkom modulu i nenamjerno posmicao jedan drugi istraživački tim. Neke njegove scene s interakcijom s ljudima su zbilja smiješne, poput onih kad mu je neugodno gledati čovjeka u oči za vrijeme razgovora pa si prebaci svoj pogled na kamere sa stropa i otud nastavlja promatrati razgovor. Zatim, prije samog zadatka koji imaju na planeti, robot si je trebao skinuti i pročitati sve podatke o svakom članu ekspedicije, a on je to sve fino pohranio nekamo drugamo jer u svojoj memoriji više nije imao dovoljno slobodnog mjesta radi svih skinutih filmova i serija. A kad mu je zbilja neugodno ili kad ga zadirkuju, onda se okrene prema kutu i stoji kao osnovnoškolac.\n\n'Shit hits the fan' kada naša ekipa sazna da je još jedna istraživačka ekipa na planeti nestala i netko im počinje hakirati sigurnosne podatke, ukratko - netko ih želi mrtve. Tempo je odličan i polako se otkrivaju nove stvari vezane za nalaze sa planeta i pozadina čudnih događaja, a na našim junacima je da otkriju tko stoji iza toga i zašto.\n\nPoglavito na Murderbotu, koji se samo želi opet natrag vratiti 'binge-watchingu' tona i tona premuim tv sadržaja, baš kao i ja.\n18 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Some planets are controlled by political or cultural systems, some owned by corporations, and some in between. One such planet is being surveyed by possible colonizers from several backgrounds when things go awry - one survey group is wiped out and another attacked. Turns out humanity also brought crime with it to space! Most of the story is about one survivor, and human-robot hybrid security clone who has gone rogue prior to the story and just wants to be free enough to watch her serials. Pretending to be still under the control of her owners, she's in control of security in what should have been a fairly cushy assignment to guard a well-meaning and peaceful team from a politically liberal planet. Then things start to happen. Charming character in a plausible future; here's hoping for more diary entries.\nread-sci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

It's not done in a relatable way at all. \"Omg they hate me because I'm a robot\". It's just said over and over again that the main character feels awkward around humans.\n\nLater on the story points out that since the main character is a robot it has no gender and doesn't care about sex. Again there's a whole paragraph on this and it doesn't feel naturally integrated into the story at all. \"Look I'm trying to be diverse\". Yeah it's a robot of course it doesn't have to have a gender. Another thing is that the main character reads actually like a girl so this whole gender neutral thing is not working out.

I mean, it just wants to be left alone and not have to deal with humans so it can watch its favorite TV shows! I can relate. But really, this was just fun. I loved the dynamic between Murderbot and its shipmates and how they didn't really know how to act around it but wanted to take its feelings into consideration, and all the awkward conversations were so much fun. I also loved seeing how Murderbot would deny caring about any of the people but then demonstrate through its actions that these people clearly did matter to it on some level at least.

Once he had hacked his governor chip and gained self-determination, he decided that, all things considered, he’d rather watch TV than murder. But to maintain a network connection to the entertainment feeds, not to mention avoid an inevitable decommissioning and disassembly, he has to continue diligently performing the banal duties of a bargain basement corporate security droid.\n\nSkynet meets The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit.\n\nMurderbot doesn’t really care about his job, or the Company that owns him, or the humans entrusted to his care. He is potentially capable of greatness, certainly of great evil, but he hasn’t figured out who he is yet or why he should even bother. In this, Murderbot is every 20-something working a boring job.\n\nSure, “sentient AI gains autonomy and embarks on a journey of self-discovery” is totally a trope by now, but All Systems Red is the highest quality trope. It is fated to be eternally anthologized as a sterling example of its sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-genre.\nripping-good-yarns\nLike\nComment"}

The slight dispassion, the ability to half-ass its job and not care, the awkward inability to make conversation, the discovery that it has some level of caring when the right subject comes along, and its ability to binge-watch TV is all so human and relatable that it's difficult to not fall in love with Murderbot. Murderbot isn't a traditional hero by any stretch of the imagination, but it rises to the challenge in ways that surprise itself, and that is the mark of a good character.\n\nThe other characters in the novella are just as interesting, and figuring out their motivations is all part of the charm of this book. (Yes, I said \"charm\" about a book in which the main character is named \"Murderbot.\") Their personalities are part of the mystery as Murderbot (and the reader) has to decide who to trust.\n\nAnd the mystery! Unpacking what's happening to the survey team, what might be going on, who's responsible, and why is all part of the fun of this novella. I easily could have read another hundred pages with these characters and set in this world, but the tight pace, single-minded story, and elegant efficiency is part of what makes All Systems Red one of the best books I've read this year.\nhome-library\n \nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-08-06", "text": "Winterstar\n192 reviews\n1 follower\nFollow\nAugust 6, 2017\nThis was a short, nice science fiction read. The book is written in first person, and it's done well enough that it doesn't detract from the story. It takes a little while to figure out the bits and pieces. I thought through some of it that the main character wasn't too bright at times, but it is explained away by the way the main character is programs. Murderbot doesn't really have a gender- gender neutral so the best way to describe the main character is well, main character or Murderbot. We do find out why Murderbot is called such and it may not be what one might expect which was an interesting reveal. It was nice to see that not all scientists are nutters and not all people trapped together have to be murdering crazies either. I liked that Murderbot's crew were able to maintain their humanity. The plot flowed smoothly and the pacing good. The writing style was smooth and worked well. There is an ending, somewhat sad but at the same happy, but it also leaves it open for more stories. Overall a fun science fiction read from a different pov.\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

It explored a new science / tech (AI) in terms of ethic/social implications without beating it over your head.

I’m not sure this novella is good science fiction, but it’s very enjoyable anyway. I like a story where people receive help from an unexpected source.\n\nThe self-named “murderbot” is a humanoid construct, with a body which is part flesh and part mechanical. It’s working a tedious security detail for a team of scientists on a routine mission, and it mostly occupies itself by downloading and bingeing TV shows. When the mission suddenly becomes exciting, the construct finds itself interacting with real people far more than it ever intended to.\n\nThe construct thinks too much like a human for me to really believe it’s the robotic creation it’s supposed to be, but that doesn’t keep the story from being amusing and entertaining.\nnovella\n \nscience-fiction\n3 likes\n5 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I do know her Fantasy books (The Cloud Roads, Books of the Raksura), and I thought that her involvement in a SFFWorld ‘Round Table’ forum discussion a few years ago was thoughtful and entertaining, but that for me was about it.* So I was quite pleased when All Systems Red appeared in my review pile. For All Systems is an out and out SF Space Adventure tale, involving AI ‘killerbots’, corporate shenanigans and nasty alien lifeforms on unexplored planets. It’s a great read.\n\n“In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.\n\nBut in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.\n\nOn a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.\n\nBut when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.”\n\nAs you can read from the publisher’s blurb, the situation isn’t that different from current writers such as, say, Jay Posey or Ian McDonald – for those of an older persuasion, I’m going to suggest Ben Bova. Where All Systems Red scores though, is that it’s a great set-up – sort’ve like a Science-Fictional version of Dexter. The voice of the AI known as ‘SecUnit’ is great – a knowing, rather sassy but clearly intelligent personality that reminded me of Heinlein’s Mike from The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress or, at times, even Marvin the Paranoid Android from A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.  It’s clever and quite depreciating, which appealed to me a lot.\n\n “I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.”\n\nBeing a novella also means that there’s no space for extraneous waffle. The book begins with a bang, and then rarely lets up. Our Murderbot (the reason for that name is told along the way, but I’ll not spoil it now) is the SecUnit that has to be sent with a survey party by The Company (also later amusingly nicknamed “EvilSurvey”) to explore potential planets for development. In Alien-style plot development, whilst on a planet the team lose contact with the neighbouring survey team from DeltFall, something not too unusual with the cheap and basic equipment hired to them by the Company. However further investigation leads to the discovery of bigger mysteries and the consequences of their discovery.\n\nAfter 144 pages it’s done. And I want more. There are things still unexplained - will the Company find out if the rogue AI is rogue? What is the Company really up to? And what’s the bigger picture?\n\nThe ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, although I am pleased to type that there will be more in this series. In my opinion, there should be. There’s a pace that meant I read this one near-non-stop, in two sittings. Besides, how often do you read a tale rooting for the bad-guy (who’s clearly not as bad as it makes himself out to be)?\n\nSurprisingly good and thoroughly recommended entertainment.\n\n* (I now know, from reading the end of this one, that she has also written for the Stargate : Atlantis and Star Wars franchises, which makes sense.)", "text": "Mark\n692 reviews\n176 followers\nFollow\nAugust 13, 2017\nMust admit, I didn’t know that Martha Wells wrote SF.

The premise is that there is a security robot that has removed its governor module. It is owned by a corporation that provides equipment and bonding services for exploration teams. Like most stereotype corporations, this one goes cheap where they can, and sometimes people get hurt, which is not a problem for a normally functioning bot with its conscience governed. When things start going sideways and there are discrepancies with systems and information, what is Murderbot to do? This is a short read and left things open for a long line of adventures within a universe that has political and corporate intrigue, an interstellar civilization, and a rogue free security bot that everyone will assume is an augmented human.\nLike\nComment"}

I wanted to continue reading, I really did.\n\nIn that universe, there are humans, augmented humans, and constructs (which are part organic and inorganic but not easily divided). The story is about a SecUnit (security construct) who has managed to disable its governor. Now that it's autonomous (or as the company likes to call it \"rogue\"), it discovers that one reason for the governor is boredom and perhaps a bit of apathy which it chooses to fill with entertainment feeds, removing documentation it should've read to make room for more media. Being a free agent is not all its cracked up to be.\n\nThe universe is consistent. Survey teams representing companies or organizations contract with the \"company\" to go out and survey planets. Sometimes there's more than one survey team on a planet. The \"company\" provides all of the equipment from the habitats to the supplies to the \"hoppers\" (surface transports) to the scientific survey equipment. All of the equipment, while working together, doesn't always work well (as equipment manufactured by the lowest bidder tends to do). The computer systems (the HubSystem, SecSystem, and MedSystem) are all interconnected and wireless. You can dip into the \"feed\" as if you were checking Twitter.\n\nThere's a nice twist at the end which I'll just mention here for you to discover.\n\nBack to this book being short. Frankly I'd love to continue reading about this nameless SecUnit. I'd demand that the author keep writing more novellas about it (him?) but she's already prolific, so I'll just make an appeal: \"More, please.\"\nLike\nComment"}

It's just not quite my genre, robots generally aren't my thing and it's a sparse and - despite the premise - almost realistic piece of writing (as opposed to epic space adventures without much psychological believability for which I have a soft spot). I remember being very impressed with her fighting scenes in The Element of Fire and here she's equally competent with the technical, practical and security side of a planetary mission.

However, this is the first book in the Murderbot Diaries series so there may be more world-building in the later books.

In my defense, we'd been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn't had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\"\n\nI can relate to Murderbot, the misanthropic construct who is contracted to provide security detail for a small expedition to a planet. Murderbot, as the A.I. calls themselves (MB is sexless and has not chosen a pronoun), is plainly uncomfortable with personal attention and has little interest in anything outside entertainment videos and the bare minimum required to do their job. I have to confess that sounds like me during most of my adolescent years at every family event, ever, just substitute a book for video.\n\n\"They’re academics, surveyors, researchers, not action-hero explorers from the serials I liked because they were unrealistic and not depressing and sordid like reality.\"\n\nWritten as a novella, the plot takes off from page two. It isn't long before both Murderbot and the team realize they're facing multiple types of danger. Characterization is one of the outstanding parts of the story, with Murderbot's nature getting a lot of subtle build. The team never stood out to any great degree, but that's partly because until this expedition, Murderbot has had generally negative experiences with the people they have been contracted to protect and assumed this group would be more of the same. The leader, Dr. Mensah, soon distinguishes herself with crisis management and leadership, (\"It was starting to occur to me that Dr. Mensah might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer, even if she didn’t look like the ones on the entertainment feed\") while an augmented human, Gurathin, presents a different kind of challenge.\n\n“I do think of it as a person,” Gurathin said. “An angry, heavily armed person who has no reason to trust us.”\n“Then stop being mean to it,” Ratthi told him. “That might help.”\n\nMy one hesitation in calling it a five star book is the ending, which felt somewhat awkward and incongruous to the personality of earlier 'Bot, who displayed little curiosity or independence. I read the story twice, the second time doing the math on the length of time 'Bot has been independent. I'm guessing around four years, based on their own estimate of 35k hours since they \"failed to become an uncontrolled killing machine.\" The resolution felt like a shortcut, and like a logic failure in 'Bot's circuts. But I'm open to discussion on it.\n\nFinal resolution aside, I certainly enjoyed the ride. I predict some kind of award nomination next season.\n\nNote from 2020: This is the first novella in a series of four, followed by a novel. Technically, they all are independent installments, a lot like the serials 'Bot is so fond of watching. However, once I was able to re-read the four novellas as a group--instead of upon release--I found the overall emotional arc/plot even more enjoyable than as installments.\n\nNote from 2024: it's like a delicious bedtime story.\n\n\"I thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need... was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I'm a pessimist.\"\n\nMe too, Murderbot. Me too.\n\n\n\nFour and a half stars, rounding up because.\n\n\nLove the 'Bot and want to join a re/read? Discuss the upcoming release?

The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\"\n\nI can relate to Murderbot, the misanthropic construct who is contracted to provide security detail for a small expedition to a planet. Murderbot, as the A.I. calls themselves (MB is sexless and has not chosen a pronoun), is plainly uncomfortable with personal attention and has little interest in anything outside entertainment videos and the bare minimum required to do their job. I have to confess that sounds like me during most of my adolescent years at every family event, ever, just substitute a book for video.\n\n\"They’re academics, surveyors, researchers, not action-hero explorers from the serials I liked because they were unrealistic and not depressing and sordid like reality.\"\n\nWritten as a novella, the plot takes off from page two. It isn't long before both Murderbot and the team realize they're facing multiple types of danger. Characterization is one of the outstanding parts of the story, with Murderbot's nature getting a lot of subtle build. The team never stood out to any great degree, but that's partly because until this expedition, Murderbot has had generally negative experiences with the people they have been contracted to protect and assumed this group would be more of the same. The leader, Dr. Mensah, soon distinguishes herself with crisis management and leadership, (\"It was starting to occur to me that Dr. Mensah might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer, even if she didn’t look like the ones on the entertainment feed\") while an augmented human, Gurathin, presents a different kind of challenge.\n\n“I do think of it as a person,” Gurathin said. “An angry, heavily armed person who has no reason to trust us.”\n“Then stop being mean to it,” Ratthi told him. “That might help.”\n\nMy one hesitation in calling it a five star book is the ending, which felt somewhat awkward and incongruous to the personality of earlier 'Bot, who displayed little curiosity or independence. I read the story twice, the second time doing the math on the length of time 'Bot has been independent. I'm guessing around four years, based on their own estimate of 35k hours since they \"failed to become an uncontrolled killing machine.\" The resolution felt like a shortcut, and like a logic failure in 'Bot's circuts. But I'm open to discussion on it.\n\nFinal resolution aside, I certainly enjoyed the ride. I predict some kind of award nomination next season.\n\nNote from 2020: This is the first novella in a series of four, followed by a novel. Technically, they all are independent installments, a lot like the serials 'Bot is so fond of watching. However, once I was able to re-read the four novellas as a group--instead of upon release--I found the overall emotional arc/plot even more enjoyable than as installments.\n\nNote from 2024: it's like a delicious bedtime story.\n\n\"I thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need... was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I'm a pessimist.\"\n\nMe too, Murderbot. Me too.\n\n\n\nFour and a half stars, rounding up because.\n\n\nLove the 'Bot and want to join a re/read? Discuss the upcoming release? Nataliya and I lead a group:\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...\nawards-of-all-sorts\n \nbring-to-the-desert-island\n \nfast-and-fun\n \n...more\n998 likes\n92 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is a delight, this novella is a delight, and I need the next one posthaste.\n\nFrom the first page Murderbot's voice leaps off the page - the wry humor (I mean, \"Murderbot\"!), the social awkwardness, the obsession with media. Super relatable. Then as the plot unfolds and Murderbot slowly becomes attached to its clients...I don't even know what to say about it, I just found it incredibly satisfying.\n\nI have absolutely zero criticisms.

A fun and light robot murderer who hacks herself to have free will and she stops murdering to watch SF sitcoms instead. :)\n\nHonestly, that's pretty cool.

An obviously sentient A.I. being ordered about = slavery in my mind. That’s why I always side with the A.I. in SF stories where it isn’t 100% clear that the A.I. is an evil monster trying to murder humanity. So it’s really easy to side with Murderbot, the media loving security in the story. It’s just a novella so there isn’t a whole lot of character development aside from Murderbots, but there is plenty of action and a thoughtful plot, along with a likeable human cast of characters. I’ll be reading more in this series once they are released. Many thanks to Alice for her glowing review which lead me to read this.\n\n\n**edit reread I wanted to read this again as I've decided to finish the series and it's been a few years since I first read it.

{"username": "", "date": "Well that was a fun little diversion. And by little, I mean LITTLE! This is, hands down, the shortest book I've read all year. And also probably the easiest read I've done all year. Given my penchant for reading large and/or heady books, this one was pretty much a \"blink and you'll miss it\" deviation for me. It was also our book club pick following the behemoth that was Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, and we chose it because it was an easy read, which we felt was necessary after wading through the 1000+ pages of TWoK.\n\nSo what did I think of All Systems Red? Well, it was...good. That's about the best I can come up with at the moment. I loved the idea of a rogue Security bot that hacked its own governor, stopped caring about the corporate mission, and decided to basically be a TV junkie. And the fact that it refers to itself as Murderbot was just priceless. But outside of those concepts, the story just didn't really move me like I hoped it would.\n\nPart if this is, I'm sure, due to the brevity of the tale. There's not a lot of room for character arcs or deep plotting in a story this short. And I get it...it's not supposed to be a monster story. This is popcorn entertainment, and it achieves that goal rather well. But, that being said, I still was left feeling a little cold after reading All Systems Red. Nobody really gets any backstory or context, the people in the tale are essentially just random people who are assigned various archetypes and behaviors to stand out. I never got much of a visual of any of them. As for Murderbot, while admired the snarky way in which it narrated its tale, I still wanted to know more about it, and this never really came to pass.\n\nAnother thing that took away from my enjoyment is the way in which the narrative unfolds. I've read several books where the storytelling was...incidental at best. But All Systems Red takes the cake. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was just kind of half-explained or defined. From the action to the locations to the characters themselves, nothing is written in much detail. In fact, the action scenes were comprised mostly of passages that read something like \"I ran at it while shooting my projectile weapon. It was shooting at me at the same time. I got hit a few times, but I managed to find a vital area on my opponent and take it down.\" And...that's it. The problem with writing like this is it robs the story of any sense of drama or suspense. It's all so...casual. And that casual writing makes the narrative casual as well, which doesn't help to engage the reader as much.\n\nBecause this is a short novella, we jump from sequence to sequence pretty quickly, but even on things that I felt should have been given more weight, Martha Wells just kinda glosses over them. Not having read any of her other works, I can't say if this is just how she writes, or if she had to constrain herself to keep the story short & sweet. Again, I wanted more.\n\nBut it's not all bad! Murderbot is a fun narrator, and carries the first person POV tale quite well. I enjoyed the snark, the sarcasm, and the flippancy in which it viewed most situations it found itself in. I loved how anti-social Murderbot was, and how it really just wanted to be left alone to watch its video entertainment...aka soap operas.\n\nThe overall concept is also rather cool, but I feel that this could have been far more impactful as either a full-length novel or a larger novella.

{"username": "", "date": "2020-04-25", "text": "Ɗẳɳ 2.☊\n160 reviews\n313 followers\nFollow\nApril 25, 2020\nI must say, for a story subtitled The Murderbot Diaries, there was an appalling lack of murder and mayhem contained within these pages—well, at least by the hand of the so-called Murderbot. And that’s a shame because what other reason than to bathe in the glorious carnage would a reader select a title like this . . . ?\n\nMurderbot, as it dubs itself, is assigned to the security detail of a scientific expedition on an alien world. Its main roles are to protect the scientists from unknown alien threats and to ensure the success of the mission. Part man part machine, it’s designed to be entirely under the control of its clients. However, a malfunction in its programming has left it with free will—a fact that it hides from its employers for fear of being decommissioned. As well as the fact that it’s not the terrifying monster it appears to be. Underneath all that armor is one clever, quick-witted, and surprisingly sympathetic individual.\n\nOn the surface, all appears to be copacetic, but in reality, it only puts in the bare minimum of effort so as to devote as much time as possible to binge its favorite shows from the entertainment feed. It’s much more concerned about the fate of those fictional characters than its human masters. The only problem is there’s a section missing from their map of the planet, and the other expedition is failing to respond to their inquiries.\n\nSabotage seems to be afoot, and, sadly, Murderbot may have to pause its shows long enough to put in a real effort . . .\n\nThis story was completely lacking in depth of character. In fact, some of the names were so challenging—Bharadwaj, Volescu, Pin-Lee, Ratthi, Overse, Guarathin—that it was difficult to even keep track of who’s who, let alone their motivations. Even though the story was only a novella, I can’t forgive the lack of character development or worldbuilding. Off the top of my head, I can think of three shorter stories that excelled at both—Legion, Moot, and Defending Elysium.\n\nAlthough to be fair, the story was told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot who wasn’t overly concerned about the fate of these civilians, so why should we be?\n\n“You don’t know who we are? They didn’t tell you?”\n“There was an info packet in my initial download.” I was still staring out at the heavy green tangle just past the rocks. I really didn’t want to get into how little I paid attention to my job. “I didn’t read it.”\nArada said, gently, “Why not?”\nWith all of them staring at me, I couldn’t come up with a good lie. “I didn’t care.”\n\nBottom line: Although the narrator was far from a gifted storyteller, the plot was decent enough. But as a heartless killing machine, the poor girl was a terrible failure.\n\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #2: ★★★☆☆½\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #3: ★★★★☆\nalien-sci-fi\n \nnovella\n \nthe-final-frontier\n44 likes\n16 comments\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2017-10-22", "text": "Acqua\n536 reviews\n235 followers\nFollow\nOctober 22, 2017\nFor a book where the secondary characters were (deliberately?) really underdeveloped, I loved it a lot.\nIt's about a SecUnit (a self-aware security droid) that calls itself \"Murderbot\" and has gone rogue - it has hacked its governor module to access the combined feed of entertainment channels (it's a bored rogue bot). Now it can act freely, but that doesn't mean it will leave the humans in danger.\n\nI loved reading in the Murderbot's PoV. I was afraid it would sound mechanical, but it didn't - and it was really entertaining. A shy, murderous droid. It works.\n\nI loved how this book avoided the \"AI falls in love and discovers they're more human than they thought\" trope - one of the many overused subtropes of \"romantic love makes us human\", which I hate (I'm looking at you, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, and also at you, Defy the Stars). Murderbot is not human. Murderbot doesn't want to be human. That means it doesn't necessarily want what the humans want, and that doesn't mean it's evil.\nSince Murderbot is not exactly what humans expect when they think about machines, there's a lot of awkwardness between it and the human crew - they do not know how to deal with a machine that looks like a human and almost acts like a human, but it's definitely not one.\n\nMost side characters are forgettable, but there is a side f/f relationship and this is only a novella.\n\nNote: yes, the main character doesn't have a gender and is not interested in sex or romance, but I wouldn't recommend this book as \"aro/ace/agender representation\" - it's about a robot.\nAromantic/asexual/agender people are real and definitely human.\nadult\n \nbest-mcs\n \nloved-it\n \n...more\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Insane.\n\nI was curious as to why when I told Goodreads I was reading this particular book – the first in the series - it didn’t bring up my old review. I figured it must be because I read it the first time as a trade edition, not a kindle edition. So I didn’t think about it.\n\nBut then I decided to look and see what I wrote about this book last time I read, nothing better, after all, than popping open my brain from a few years ago to see what was going on inside, and lo and behold, there was no review.\n\nI’d skipped a book.\n\nMy world crashed down upon me. I mean, am I in trouble? Are the review cops coming to haul me away? Am I getting kicked out the brotherhood? Would my family still love me?

I mean, they miss me there.\n\nSo, yeah, I may have failed, but I’m not a total loser.\n\nBut if I had written a review of the book when I first read it, just after came out, I imagine it would have gone something like this:\n\n\nWow, it’s 2017. Work has been crazy, putting in long hours, barely have time to read. But this book was great. Wish it were longer. Also, what’s the deal with my kids? Blah blah blah.

In case you were wondering, I didn’t just pull that from a time machine, which I invented and have used not to enrich myself, or to alter history for the better, but instead to ask myself my thoughts on books I’ve read, and still remember,sorta, in order to get a slightly different take on it since I just re-read said books. Yep, none of that happened. So not even worth mentioning.\n\nBut the older, wiser, more sophisticated me has a unique take on this, the very first of theMurderbot books. Yes, it was good, and yes, I do wish it were longer, and yes, work, and yes my kid! And yes, still have strong opinions about boring things. But also, as an islander now, I have to ask, what’s the deal with all the water?\n\nNo, that’s not it. I forgot, all that typing as set up and it slipped my mind.

I wish I could give you a well-considered reason for this, but I'm not sure I can produce one. It seemed like the plot took over and that was a lot less interesting than this fantastic, lazy Murderbot whose character, musings, and awkward interactions with humans Wells delights us with in the previous 2/3 of the book. It's not that the plot doesn't start until the last 1/3, but that the last 1/3 feels like a perfunctory going through the motions, like just filling in the blanks for the explanations needed.\n\nMurderbot has hacked his governor module, which means he no longer has to follow his programming and his more organic/human elements influence his thinking. He's kind of like a teenager who basically just wants to watch TV. He's pretty damn funny and rather endearing. And he's all too human: \"I don't know what I want... But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.\"\n\nI am looking forward to the next book in the series. Wells sets up a fascinating world with a wide range of human-machine life forms and interactions, as well as cost-cutting corporate-control at every turn. But mostly, I just want to keep following Murderbot.\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "books-of-2018", "text": "Evelina | AvalinahsBooks\n925 reviews\n472 followers\nFollow\nMarch 16, 2018\nI had heard all sorts of wonderful things about All Systems Red before I picked it up (I have a lot of Goodreads friends who know their stuff when it comes to sci-fi! Yes, I'm looking at you, Caro M.) Now I trust their recommendations even more, because this book is easily my best February read. You can read the post with better formatting here on my blog.\n\n5 Reasons To Read All Systems Red\n\n\"Murderbot\" is a jailbroken security android (cyborg? Well, you know.) Basically, SecUnits (as they're called) function as remotely controlled synthetic human slaves, basically, and they don't get a say in any of what they're doing, which is mostly murdering hostiles and getting mashed in the process. Murderbot though, a name it has sarcastically given itself (and will be henceforth referred to as 'them' in this review), have jailbroken themselves and would rather just watch hours and hours of sci-fi soaps than interact with humans, who actually give them anxiety fits. Murderbot is incredibly introverted, you see. But in order to not disclose a) having a mind b) having free will c) their predilection towards sci-fi soap operas, Murderbot still has to do their job. Which is how they end up on a ship with a crew they actually don't hate, but... on a mission nobody should be on. Hint: it's a mission that is kind of hard to survive, and it's clearly rigged.\n\n\nReason #1. Murderbot Is More Human Than The Actual Humans\n\nMurderbot comes across as an incredibly introverted personality who is empathetic like any other human being (maybe more so?), but shy of it and trying to hide it even from their own self. Seeing them turn to face the corner when talking to humans or panic while trying not to have their fave scrunch up into a mask of despair when being spoken to was incredibly amusing - and not in a mean way. Murderbot's shyness is SO relatable! You will love this character to bits. I know I did.\n\n\n\n\n\nReason #2. It's Like A Doctor Who Episode With David Tennant\n\nFor any Doctor Who fans, this book is like a good episode from the Tennant days – a hostile planet pretending to be neutral, and things slowly get worse and worse and he crew has to figure out what is up. It's just so good! My interest didn't drop even once, while reading this. And I realized how much I miss a good Doctor Who episode from the old days. (Well... the \"newer old days\"!)\n\n\n\n\nI thought this was topical on the whole #FEELS topic. Ha. Topic. Topical. (Don't hit me.)\n\n\nReason #3. The Virtues\n\nThis book has incredibly good virtues and such an amazing moral atmosphere. And it's presented in such a self-deprecating manner as well (Shruti, you must read this!) Murderbot is willing to throw themselves in danger to protect the ones they care about, even though they're aware humans are not really supposed to care \"back\". It's really touching how Murderbot calls them \"my humans\". I would say Murderbot is a true sci-fi knight.\n\n\n\n\n\nReason #4. Murderbot's Gender Or Lack Thereof\n\nWell, this is going to be hard to formulate. So, have you ever felt underrepresented? If you're a woman, you most likely have. Because we've got like maybe 2 heroes who jump in and save the day. Other than that, guys always do all the saving. Murderbot though? They don't really have a gender (and are often referred to as ‘it' in the book, but I refuse - Murderbot has too much personality for that!) Anyway, despite probably looking like Terminator, Murderbot is not referred to as male - which is why I found myself imagining them more female than male by the middle of the book! I was surprised, but I figure it comes from wanting to see myself represented as able to do stuff, you know? And Murderbot I'd a character that lets you do that. It's pretty great.\n\n\nReason #5. It's Just So Funny!\n\n\n\n\nSo maybe this should have been the number one reason. This book will keep you laughing throughout the entire time you're reading it, I mean, when you're not having #feels. The manner it is written, and especially the manner Murderbot talks in is just priceless. I can't wait for further installments of The Murderbot diaries!\n\n\nOther Books You Might Like\n\nI wish I could recommend you more books like that! But such gems are not common. And I would be very happy if you recommended me something similar. Meanwhile, I can only think of two books that fit the style – in terms of humor, at least. Redshirts has the same kind of \"I can't stop laughing\" thing going on, and also shares some moments of poignancy by the end. It's also impossible to put down. As for The Martian, some of the topics might be unrelated at all, but the main character is similar to Murderbot – very resourcefull, brave and has the same vein of humor in the way he talks. It's also written in first person. I enjoyed both of these a lot!\n\n\n\n\nRead Post on My Blog | My Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter\nbooks-of-2018\n \nfavorites\n \nfiction\n \n...more\n43 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\"\n\nAs first paragraphs go, this book (which feels like The Perks of Being a Wallflower mixed with I Robot) is hard to beat. That's the premise of All Systems Red, where self-stylized Murderbot (think Abed Nadir with some mechanical parts), having achieved sentience, desires nothing more than to be left alone and watch TV for the remainder of it's existence. However, the same culture of complacency and corruption in the ubiquitous parent company company which allowed Murderbot to break free of it's robotic fetters enable a mysterious enemy to interfere with Murderbot's carefully laid lack of plans.\n\nA very short book, this makes for a quick, but fantastic read.

What would happen if humans lost that control?\n\nFor a novella just around 150 pages, this book read like a much longer book...in a good way.

I just watched the fourth episode of the apple TV adaptation and kept complaining loudly how untrue to the book it is. Nope, I have bad recall! So, again the Graphic Audio… They did a good job with that fourth episode.

I just read System Collapse (Murderbot #7), had a lot of fun and decided that it is finally time for a re-read of the entire series.\n\nWow, I didn‘t remember that the plot was so dramatic! I had forgotten most of it. And I had also forgotten that so many of the characters showing up in later novellas were here already. I also didn‘t recall the quieter scenes. Maybe it needs a re-read to pick up those details.\n\nNot trying to assign a gender to Murderbot anymore.

This is a winner!\n\n\"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\"\nThat could be me on any given day.\n\nLots of potential. Is Murderbot a real person or not? The awkwardness of the crew, trying to figure out the correct way of interacting with Murderbot, once they realized that perhaps there is a person behind that opaque faceplate, was pretty priceless.\n\nAnd Murderbot's horror at their attempts to interact! Talking to the humans! And feelings, oh no!\n\nI tried not to assign a gender to Murderbot. I don't want to use \"it\" as a personal pronoun. I am leaning towards using \"him\", not quite sure why.

Murderbot has long ago hacked its governor chip, meaning it has free will, but it must keep this fact hidden or risk being dismantled, or worse, become a mindless drone again for The Company. When things go wrong on the expedition, however, Murderbot finds it harder and harder to stay hidden and still keep the humans safe.\nMy affection for stories about Artificial Intelligence was firmly established a few years ago when I re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation and found that Data has become my favorite character. Or maybe it goes all the way back to my teenage years when I unexpectedly fell in love with Terminator 2 which I saw 7 times in the movie theater (I happened to work at a theater at the time so it's not that impressive...or geeky - Much). I think I really enjoy the scope stories abut AIs give to ask big questions like...what does it mean to be human?...what is life?...what constitutes sentience?... but in a way that is more entertaining and less stuffy than reading a philosophy text book.\n\nAnd that's the main reason you should read All Systems Red - it's hugely entertaining! Murderbot is one of the best characters I've read all year. The very vision of a bored, apathetic, socially awkward corporate worker who can't wait to get off and lose itself in the thousands of hours of entertainment serials it can download. It has a wicked, sardonic sense of humor and cynical outlook on life that was a beauty to behold and often made me laugh out loud. We've mostly all been there and had to try to hide that negative, shy, pathetic side of ourselves.\n\nThe difference with Murderbot is that it's a made thing out of a blend of organic and inorganic materials and it is not supposed to have a personality. It's also not supposed to care about the humans it is guarding but even though it is inclined not to, it does, because they are a nice, intelligent, tight knit group of friends that don't make Murderbot do horrible or humiliating things. Against its will, it develops an affection for them or, at least, doesn't want to see them die.\n\nThe story is also fast-paced and a lot of fun being part mystery, part sci-fi thriller and part action-adventure. Given that this is a novella and only has a limited page count, Wells does an admirable job telling a well-rounded, satisfying and complete story that also left me wanting more and excited that this is book one in a series. You can probably thank Murderbot for me wanting more!\n\nThe society and and context of the \"Sec Units\" in the universe is also well established, which is again really impressive for such a short book especially since the world-building is well-integrated into the plot and does not slow the pace down one bit.\n\nAll in all this was a very enjoyable and neat bit of storytelling which I would highly recommend!\n\nFINAL VERDICT: A really entertaining and well told AI novella!\n2017reads\n \nauthor-white\n \nfemaleauthor\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

All Systems Red delivers exactly the kind of thing I want to see in a book told through a robot's eyes, in a tight little novella. Murderbot is a security bot, who has hacked itself and overridden its security protocols, partly so it can make judgment calls on its orders, and partly so it can watch countless hours of TV. When the research expedition Murderbot is working for starts having problems much bigger than the brochure advertised, things get interesting.\n\nThe book is very short so I don't want to talk too much about the plot, but Wells keeps things comprehensible and entertaining, all while touching on many of the interesting questions that come up when we talk about artificial intelligence. What makes someone a human, what makes someone a being? I think the argument of whether something non-biological can have sapience really brings up more questions on what it means to be human than what it means to be robot. And when it's well done, it's fascinating, it's compelling, and it's great fun to read.\n\nMurderbot is also a very lovable character, which might be surprising for a being that calls itself 'Murderbot'. But being broken and flawed and terrible at social interaction give this robot more character, illicits more sympathy, than many human characters manage to.\n\nAll Systems Red also manages to contain a story that feels complete in itself, while still setting up for future books. Which is fantastic, because I love Murderbot, and would gladly read only about Murderbot for as much as I can.\nartificial-intelligence\n \nnovella\n \nown-ebook\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

The plot's straight-forward, the prose is decent, and it's charming and witty. Murderbot, who repeatedly says that she'd rather be netflixing, is surprisingly relatable. One of my favorite parts is when Murderbot is faced with the prospect of spending time with people and is (understandably) horrified. She can't control her facial reaction which in turn makes the human crew she's assigned to uncomfortable to know that they're making Murderbot uncomfortable (and that she has feelings as human as any of them).\n\nAlso, I've just realized that I've been using female pronouns for Murderbot, when Murderbot is actually genderless and is referred to as 'it' by the crew. For some reason I naturally thought of Murderbot as being female and I'm not sure why, maybe because the author is a woman?\n\nPosted in Mr. Philip's Library\n2017-releases\n \nauthor-woman\n \nhugo\n \n...more\n99 likes\n18 comments\nLike\nComment"}

All Systems Red is less than 150 small pages long. Barely an evenings read.\nOtherwise, this work is simply magnificent. By the end, I realised that although I have been reading AI and robot scifi for over 40 years, starting with my total immersion in I Robot by Asimov - that nevertheless I have never been brought to empathise as closely with a Bot as is achieved here.\nAnd perhaps (although resented by me) the brevity is an artform in itself, as the author manages to construct and bring to credible close, worlds, characters and plausible story without ever seeming to rush, yet keeping the pages turning.\nThe downside is, no library I've found holds this series, and I'm hooked, but loath to fork out $20 a pop for each of the (6?) subsequent, cheaply bound paperbacks.\n\nThe books are by TOR, and are very lightly bound in soft cover.

Muderbot is such a great protagonists. And I feel like I was unnecessarily critical of the world-building last time. There's nothing wrong with it, we just don't get a lot because this is a short book focused on making sure we get to know Muderbot well, which we do. I'm excited to finally continue the series.\n\n*********************************************\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this novella. Even though the synopsis sounded really cool, I didn't have many expectations. It's about a robot, but since it also has organic parts, I'm thinking more of a cyborg. But that's beside the point. The protagonist, and narrator, refers to itself as Murderbot. It's managed to hack into its system and sever the part which makes it obligated to obey the company that created it. The first line of the novella is this:\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\n\nI mean, how awesome is that? Anyone who decides to forgo mass murder because there are so many book and TV shows to watch... that's my kind of person.\n\nThen there's the fact that it genuinely does not give a fuck about anyone. It just wants to watch the shows and be left alone. It only does a half-assed job whenever it's assigned to accompany a team of employers for their survey on a planet, acting as monitor and security. This time, there's another team, people who actually seem nice. Not that it cares. It usually avoids people. But then stuff starts to go wrong and our beloved Murderbot may be the only chance of the team's survival.\n\nIt's a good plot. And the side characters are likable. I especially liked the team leader and the one guy who didn't like our Murderbot. The world building could use work. I still can't get a clear picture of what kind of world the novella is set in. If it weren't for the protagonist being as brilliant as it is, the novella wouldn't have been as good.\n\nBack to Murderbot. I love this it. In fact, I have a couple more quotes from the novella.\n\n\"Are you all right?\"\nThat was too much attention. I turned around and walked into the corner, facing away from them.\n\n\nI liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked the real ones, but you can't have one without the other.\n\nHow could you not love it?! I can't wait to see where it will go next, especially after that ending, which I also loved. I highly recommend this novella, if only just so you can get to know Murderbot.\n2017-reads\n \nthe-great-short\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I'll say no more, because of spoilers, but I suspect you'll know what I mean if you've read it. Still, a very promising start and I'll happily read more.\n\nA re-read a couple of years later confirmed those impressions - loved it, right up to a rather abrupt end.

This first \"Murderbot\" novella is therefore a working hard-boiled story. Someone has slaughtered the scientists at one planetary survey base, and the inhabitants of the other, with their security robot (aka the titular Murderbot), have to figure out who and why, while also trying to stay alive. Murderbot's unexpected musings on humanity, the society that created him, and the nature of free will provide the philosophical and thematic base of the story, but this is a locked-room (or base) mystery with a corking good supporting cast and a suspenseful ending.

{"username": "", "date": "2017-12-23", "text": "Thomas\n2,087 reviews\n83 followers\nFollow\nOctober 13, 2017\nMeet Murderbot. Murderbot is a half-robot, half-organic construct that's been hired to assist an excavation crew doing a survey on a new planet. Murderbot has disabled the governor in itself, allowing it to do such things as ignore direct orders, skip scheduled upgrades, and not follow its own directives. In short, Murderbot has become a sentient entity without any restraints. Luckily, \"Murderbot\" doesn't accurately describe itself.\n\nThis novella is an intriguing look at human/robot relations, as told from the perspective of the robot. There may be more to Murderbot's organic side than this story lets on (it doesn't have complete recall on some events that happened in its past), but the way the story is told, it feels like it's more robot than organic. That being said, this is the first in a series of novellas, so maybe that's something we'll learn in a future volume. Regardless, Murderbot has an empathetic side, as well as other emotions that her human co-workers didn't expect to see.\n\nI'm a reader of the webcomic Questionable Content, and as I was reading this story, I kept picturing Bubbles as Murderbot. As such, it made me envision Murberbot as female, even though there's nothing in the story to support it. Due to that connection, or possibly to the fact that the author is female, Murderbot felt female to me throughout the story. I don't know if other readers got that feeling out of the story; I'd be curious to know.\n\nThe story is set in a science-fictional world, but at its heart, it's a mystery. The story opens part of the way into the excavation, and we learn that a good chunk of their information has gone missing from their files. At that point, the characters have to learn who's behind the sabotage, before things turn deadly. The structure of the story feels like a whodunnit, and I see one other review has labeled it as a hard-boiled story, which I get, though I don't necessarily agree.\n\nEither way, this is a sharp story with an engaging narrator and likable supporting characters. It doesn't quite reach the four-star level with me, but that's likely due to having high expectations going into the story. All Systems Red is getting tremendous hype, not unjustly, but I was expecting something a bit more wowie-zowie out of it based on it all. I'll definitely read the rest of the series, though.\n2017\n \ne-book\n \nmystery\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-10-12", "text": "Stephen\n473 reviews\n64 followers\nFollow\nOctober 12, 2017\nEnjoyable sci-fi read. Liked Murderbot, the too human cyborg at the center of this drama. A very original character. Built to be a robotic security agent, he has hacked his system to allow freewill, only to find he really doesn't care to do much besides watching serial TV shows. When called on to protect his clients, he initially does so more because it's his job and he'd feel stupid watching videos instead than any order or commitment. As he gets to know his clients he finds he's more invested in their well being than expected and goes to great lengths to protect them\n\nLiked the supporting characters, setting and drama built in the earlier parts of the story. That drama unfortunately fizzles in the the big reveal when the \nvillain turns out to be a not to clever bureaucrat vs someone truly villainous. How dumb is this guy? He's knows when he meets Murderbot on the plateau outside GrayCris' camp that Murderbot has somehow protected and hidden his clients and killed or disabled three SecUnits left behind at the DeltFall camp with no apparent injury to himself. Murderbot is therefore smart and exceedingly dangerous. Murderbot tells him that he has no governor and therefore operates with free will. Message: Everything Murderbot has done was done by choice vs order or programming. He's unlikely to trust anything the person trying to kill him promises. Yet Blue assumes that he will follow his order to retrieve Mensah based on a weak promise and sends only one SecUnit to kill him.. What could have been an epic battle of wits and firepower to escape the planet never happens.\n\nThe final pages are also completely out of character. Murderbot doesn't really like people and has no idea what he wants to do but in the space a single page hatches a completely random plan to \nleave those who care about him behind in favor of hopping a ride on a random ship and life where he is almost certain to have to deal with complete strangers. I understand setting up for a sequel but this could have been done with more elegance in line with the Murderbot character established throughout the rest of the book.\n\nSo, 3 stars instead of 4 due to a weak ending, but still a recommended read.\n6 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Having our hero be an apathetic, pessimistic killer android who can’t stand being looked at without its helmet on (who, basically, can't stand to be seen and/or seen as vaguely human) and who just wants to spend its time in the comforting grip of TV might seem to some readers like an outlandish premise, but in Wells’ hands Murderbot is wonderfully relatable, very funny, and a great narrator, editorial asides and all. The story is well put together and sketches out an intriguing future, but the real draw is our host, and the result is a story that builds to an unexpectedly moving climax. I'm definitely eager to read more from our SecUnit.\n2017\n \nrt\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2021 reread:\n\nThis was just what the doctor ordered.\n\nA planetary survey crew's Security 'droid has secretly hacked its governor module, but instead of killing the humans it just wants to be left alone and watch media.\n\n\nIt had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\nWhen there are signs that the mission had been sabotaged, however, and the neighboring mission goes dark it has to help its humans to figure out what is happening.\n\nThis novella's strengths are its relentless pace and its unique main character. Murderbot is a non-binary half bot / half human construct, that is painfully shy and is still figuring out its own personality, while initially trying to pretend that it is just a SecUnit that is following orders. Turns out its humans are really nice, though, which only makes matters worse, because now there might be other reasons to actually try to keep them alive, apart from it looking bad on Murderbot's record if it fails to do so. Murderbot, however, feels far more comfortable with the fictional characters of its favorite soap opera than it does with being around real people.\n\nWhile the awkward interactions between Murderbot and the rest of the crew are rather sweet, the rogue SecUnit's inner monologue is often extremely funny. It is snarky, a little grumpy, sarcastic. But under its armor Murderbot is a little softie. A softie with build-in weaponry.\n\n\nGurathin turned to me. \"So you don't have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\"\nI looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”\n\nWhich comes in handy (the guns - not being a softie) when the shit hits the fan.\n\nAll the while this little book also has some interesting things to say about free will, human treatment of androids and about being an introvert.\n\nIt is a quick read that is fun and streamlined, but not shallow.

Cheesy, campy, rollicking fun... and emotionally poignant. There's some surprisingly heavy themes wrapped up in this bit of easily digestible fluff, and I think I have a new favorite character.\n\nThe shortness does have some downsides. The characters don't get much description, and there's a lot of telling instead of showing, but I suspect that's intentional. Somehow, maybe because of the brevity, it manages to work, coming across as Murderbot telling its story to the reader. But that same shortness keeps the story cohesive (if, as previously mentioned, quite campy).\n\nI don't know. Eternal classic of literature? Probably not, but it was exactly what I needed. Giving it 5* anyway, because it's been a while since I enjoyed a book that much.\nform-novella\n \ngenre-action\n \nread-in-2017\n \n...more\n8 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot’s journey to true autonomy is also interesting. The ‘thriller mystery’ part of the plot is really one note and makes little sense (even the characters in the story say so).

This book deserves the top rating; it was both good and fun. And as a novella, it's a useful book-length to use to explore an interesting idea: What is the perspective of an AI (contained in a robot) that is part of a human team in a difficult situation where the AIs training and interests might diverge from the human's?\n\nYou learn in the first paragraph that the AI should have a constraining governor in it that keeps it from having human-level attachments & feelings, but which is non-functional during the episode of the book. The AI was built to be a killing machine, but forcibly constrained (\"covered\") to be in the service of humans. When the governor doesn't work, will such an AI be nice to us?\n\nThis is a question that is \"in the air\" in popular culture now because of the rapid advancement of AI capabilities and HW/SW. This book doesn't have a deep intellectual exploration of the possibilities, the way academic (or popular non-fictional) treatments do. Instead, the author/story takes a position, and lets the story emerge.\n\nThe story itself is interesting, fast-paced, and very well written by a competent author. And, frankly, it's fun. Because the book is so short, I'm seriously tempted to re-read it just because of the joy I had reading it.\n\nOnline scuttlebutt says this will become part of a series, or a further-developed story. I can't wait to read more.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-11-04", "text": "John\nAuthor \n4 books\n27 followers\nFollow\nNovember 4, 2017\nWells spins a good yarn. An interesting take on artificial intelligence (AI), with the story told from the AI's point of view. In this case, the AI is a \"murderbot\", and sort of humanoid/machine that is meant to provide security for humans on a planetary expedition. It hacks into its own firmware and bypasses those controls that tie it to servitude to humans. But instead of going off the rails--as robots predictably do in so many sci fi novels--it instead becomes more human.\n\nThe story held my interest all the way through, until the final chapter, which came across as a sort of afterthought, an addendum to the \"real\" story, and something I thought wasn't really necessary. It felt rushed and forced, but it did set the story up for a sequel, or a series. Still, I feel it could have been accomplished earlier in the story. In any event, the book is relatively short (I read it in one sitting) and posits some good old fashioned hard sci fi plot lines. Worth a read.\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

As it turned out though, this little novella was a real treat.\n\nTold from the point of a view of a rogue SecUnit—a part organic, part synthetic android designed to provide humans with protection and security services—this story takes readers on a journey to a distant planet being explored by team of scientists. Accompanying them is our protagonist, a self-proclaimed “Murderbot”, whose presence is required by the Company sponsoring the mission. Thing is though, Murderbot doesn’t exactly feel warm and fuzzy towards humans, and it knows that the scientists aren’t too comfortable with having a SecUnit on the team either, given the cagey way they get whenever it’s around.\n\nStill, that’s just fine for Murderbot. Having hacked its own governor so that it doesn’t have to follow Company directives, all it wants is to be left alone to enjoy the thousands of hours of entertainment vids that it has downloaded from the humans’ satellites. Of course, no one can suspect that Murderbot is secretly autonomous, so it still has to go about its job like everything is normal, and this arrangement was working out just fine until one day, a routine surface test goes seriously wrong. Murderbot ends up saving the day, earning the admiration and curiosity of the team leader, Dr. Mensah. Soon, Murderbot is left with no choice but to take the lead in defending the scientists, when disaster strikes another neighboring expedition on the planet and threatens to come after them next.\n\nHaving read a few of the author’s Raksura novels, I was already familiar with her penchant for throwing readers into the thick of things, leaving them to gradually feel everything out for themselves. Thus I was unsurprised with the way this story opened—by unceremoniously dropping us into Murderbot’s head with hardly any context and minimal background information given. It takes a while to even grasp the kind of protagonist Murderbot is: an artificial entity, albeit a very sentient and self-aware one, complete with personality quirks and a dry sense of humor. While I’ve read plenty of books starring robot protagonists, I can honestly say I’ve never met one quite as unique and interesting as Murderbot. Martha Wells may be tight-fisted when it comes to the details, but she knows exactly how to get your attention. Everything from Murderbot’s anti-social tendencies to its love of cheesy soap operas made me want to keep reading to discover more about the character and why it is telling this story.\n\nAt just a little under 150 pages though, and with so much ground to cover, there’s not much opportunity to stop and take a breath. As much as I loved how this book was so snappy and fast-paced, you do have to find your footing quickly or risk getting left behind. This means learning and familiarizing yourself with the characters as soon as they’re introduced, and most of them, like the humans on the science team, are only going to be lightly sketched. This was probably my only criticism; considering how over time, Murderbot comes to see the team as “its humans” and become very protective of them, it would have been helpful to develop those characters a bit more, especially since our protagonist begins this tale by being very disdainful of them.\n\nStill, there wasn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about this book. It was entertaining, and more importantly, it also felt complete to me, unlike a lot of novellas that leave me wanting more. Plus, this snarky first-person narrative style is quite different from what I’m used to when it comes to Wells, but I think I could grow to like it! Murderbot’s narration was a joy to follow, and I even found myself chuckling at many of the story’s scenes. Overall, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and I definitely would not hesitate recommending All Systems Red to anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix with a fun and captivating premise.

While I’ve read plenty of books starring robot protagonists, I can honestly say I’ve never met one quite as unique and interesting as Murderbot. Martha Wells may be tight-fisted when it comes to the details, but she knows exactly how to get your attention. Everything from Murderbot’s anti-social tendencies to its love of cheesy soap operas made me want to keep reading to discover more about the character and why it is telling this story.\n\nAt just a little under 150 pages though, and with so much ground to cover, there’s not much opportunity to stop and take a breath. As much as I loved how this book was so snappy and fast-paced, you do have to find your footing quickly or risk getting left behind. This means learning and familiarizing yourself with the characters as soon as they’re introduced, and most of them, like the humans on the science team, are only going to be lightly sketched. This was probably my only criticism; considering how over time, Murderbot comes to see the team as “its humans” and become very protective of them, it would have been helpful to develop those characters a bit more, especially since our protagonist begins this tale by being very disdainful of them.\n\nStill, there wasn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about this book. It was entertaining, and more importantly, it also felt complete to me, unlike a lot of novellas that leave me wanting more. Plus, this snarky first-person narrative style is quite different from what I’m used to when it comes to Wells, but I think I could grow to like it! Murderbot’s narration was a joy to follow, and I even found myself chuckling at many of the story’s scenes. Overall, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and I definitely would not hesitate recommending All Systems Red to anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix with a fun and captivating premise. I was excited when I found out this was going to be a series, and I can’t wait to check out the next installment of the Murderbot Diaries.\narcs-and-galleys\n \nnovella\n \nreview-copy\n \n...more\n49 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Really quite excellent, actually. It would've rated higher, but it was short and left me wanting more whereas a 5-star book leaves me feeling sated.\n\nBased on the title I thought this was going to be a violent SF horror novel, but it's misleading. A cyborg SecUnit who thinks of himself as \"Murderbot\" is rented out as security detail to a team of human scientists doing planetary research. Unlike millions of other SecUnits, this one is complicated, smart and individualistic - things that Units aren't supposed to be. As the situation on the planet becomes dangerous and the SecUnit shows himself to be trustworthy, his clients grow attached to him. And although he's programmed to be impersonal, he grows fond of them in a distant, confused way.\n\nThe best part of this book is seeing how the SecUnit fights against emotions he doesn't understand and doesn't want to understand. Although I enjoyed the skulduggery elements too (I have thus far neglected to mention the major storyline involving sabotage, murder and bribery), it was the brilliantly written SecUnit's struggle with his unnatural feelings of humanity that pushed this book from good to great and nearly perfect. I just wish it had been longer and shared more of SecUnit's background.\n4-stars\n \nfavorite-authors\n \ng-sci-fi\n \n...more\n10 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I also found an interview with Ms. Wells. Here is one of the questions regarding this book:\n\nQ: Has there been any interest in turning All Systems Red into a movie or TV show?\n\nA: No, there’s been no interest that I know of. I’m not sure what would work best, though a movie or TV show would have to have a lot of voiceover, since so much of the story is internal to the main character.\n\nQ: If this did happen, who would you like to see play the main characters and why them?\n\nA: I’m not sure who would play Murderbot. I was always kind of imagining Viola Davis [Suicide Squad] for Dr. Mensah. In the story, Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon, is meant to be a far future version of How To Get Away With Murder.\n\nEntry # 3\n\nI have read a couple of times now, in two different interviews, that Ms. Wells credits that murderbot was inspired by Tanith Lee's \"Silver Metal Lover\" and Tanith Lee's writing in general. Ms. Wells has grown in stature in my reading opinion.\n\nThis book was certainly well written and an entertaining story and I totally look forward to the next installment of this series.\n2017-09-books-bought\n101 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

After gaining consciousness, Murderbot thinks about killing all humans, only to push it off in favor of watching the thousands of hours of media he now has access to. But when his team’s mission starts going awry, Murderbot has to start interacting with the very humans he dislikes, all without giving away that he’s now conscious. Just a funny and well-written character backed by an interesting story.\n\n(Editor’s Note: A lot of reviewers are referring to Murderbot as a female, although Murderbot is more accurately an “it.” I always pictured Murderbot as male because its DGAF attitude re: work reminded me so strongly of Jay Cutler)\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

We could watch Netflix and be buddies.\n\nThis book is super fun, but also really sweet. Murderbot is a security robot who hacked its own governor chip, allowing it to have full autonomy. It's bored and watches lots of TV, and just kind of half-asses its security job. Then things start going wrong and it actually has to interact with its humans to figure out what's going on and keep them safe.\n\n(I keep wanting to call Murderbot \"her\", but... it's a bot. It literally has no gender or sex. But I think of it as feminine, I think because of the robot named Bubbles in Questionable Content.)\n\nBeyond the basic plot, this story is entirely endearing. Murderbot is awkward with humans, but they are all nice so it actually likes these humans, but it doesn't know how to really interact with them, and it's all a mess. It definitely has opinions on its shows, though. By the end, I just wanted to hug Murderbot, though I know it would not be at all comfortable with that so I'd have to maybe resort to finding a camera and giving it an enthusiastic thumbs-up.\nread-in-2017\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The very first chapter let me know that I was really going to enjoy this ride. And I did.\n\n\nI COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n-p1\n\n\n\nMurderbot is incredibly snarky – which I appreciate. Murderbot is a SecUnit construct – part organic, part bionic – with no sexual parts, making it agendered. It does not have a name other than what it named itself: Murderbot. It does not think of itself with as a gender but I decided it was a she (in my head). Murderbot, like most of us, is contemptuous of humans and irritated by them – she/it just wants to be left alone so it could stream. 35,000 hours of entertainment thus far – with many, many more series to glom.\n\nOh, how I understand you, Murderbot. That irritation you feel each time someone interrupts your streaming with some inane human request or activity? I am there with you. That annoyance you feel when you have to pause a show to deal with “real life” is quite the same way I feel when I have to put down my book(s) and go to work. The desire you feel to murder someone because they can’t understand that YES, You ARE busy consuming things you want to consume? It’s like an itch you can’t scratch...and plus who has time for murder when you can get back to reading as soon as they leave you alone?\n\nMurderbot was created and is owned by “the company.” IDK exactly who/what the company is – there is no real explanation. The company seems to be some large private conglomerate that has a monopoly on [new] planet exploration. The company then sells sections of the planet along with survey specs to different exploration groups looking for new flora and fauna. In order to buy these sections (and the ability to explore and possibly discover new things) the exploration groups must also purchase [only] company supplies, computer equipment, life support & Communications (HubSystem) and SecUnits (android security units). The SecUnits are required and gives the company an additional edge: the SecUnits + the HubSystem records EVERYTHING (no privacy at all). And like all good conglomerates, the company buys everything as cheap as possible AND they farm all recordings for as much data as possible and then sells it to the highest bidder.\n\nMurderbot is a SecUnit who is completely self-aware (IDK if any of the others are but I get the feeling they are). Murderbot hacked it’s “governor module” as soon as it could do so, making it autonomous. This means that Murderbot decides when and if it will download updates as well what it will attend to. Mostly, it wants to attend to the series it’s currently downloaded.\n\nMurderbot develops an unlikely attachment to its human contracts – mostly because they are a small, close-knit group of eight. They don’t treat it like equipment – they seem to like it and think of it as more of someone enslaved instead of a construct – which Murderbot finds both weirdly endearing and weird in an “OMG! Help! The stupid humans want to TALK to me about feelings and stuff and OMG leave me alone!” way. Therefore, Murderbot is much more interested in keeping this group alive than most. Luckily for Murderbot’s contracts cause the shit hits the fan and splatters rather quickly.\n\nI really don’t want to discuss much more of the plot than the above as I don’t want to spoil any of it. Suffice to say that Murderbot is a great character and All Systems Red was a great novella. I certainly plan on reading any new additions to this series.\n\n2017\n \n2017-reading-challenges\n \namazing-amazingness\n \n...more\n7 likes\n7 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is a shy, awkward, introvert who spends the majority of it's time watching reality TV (haha while pretending to follow orders from the humans). It's a cyborg with free will who lives in a world where cyborgs are mindless machines completely controlled by corporations. What an interesting concept.\n\nWhen I began reading, I was under the impression that this would be dark, but it was really just cynical and mostly lighthearted. It was more comical than I expected, but I am not disappointed at all because I love Murderbot's character so much! I was so happy for the way Murderbot's story ended. The possibilities for the next book are endless. Overall this book was a fun read! I am sure there are plenty of books that explore a similar concept and are very dark and heart wrenching. I appreciate that this one did something different.\n\nThe reason I initially gave this book 3 stars was due to the lack of a complex plot. It really was straightforward and predictable. Now that I have had time to think about it, I believe the main focus was Muderbot and the exploration of the \"other\" and what it means to be prejudice. This is most likely why the plot was simple. I also appreciate the world building much more now then I did initially. It was more complex and intriguing then I gave it credit for. I honestly can not stop thinking about this novella. I can't wait to read the next one!! I might even change my rating to 4 stars. I think I was so wrapped up in what I thought it was supposed to be that I didn't appreciate it for what it was.\nfavorites\n \nfemale-sff-adult\n \nsci-fi\n \n...more\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}

At just over a 150 paged this book is all killer no filler telling the story of Murderbot, a recently self aware half organic/robotic, who at the start of the story has recently hacked his system so that he is beholden to nobody and can do as he pleases. The book covers a research team on a remote planet who are there for preservation and the Murderbot is supplied by the company who allow such expeditions as protection to this crew.\n\nWhat follows is a thrilling tale of murder, a rival faction seeking to get the resources this planet has and to eliminate anyone else who are there. Murderbot is the first person narrator of this book and his new found freedom leads to some funny and witting internal monologue as he tries to cope and deal with his humans who he no longer is obligated to protect but does so anyway because he likes their leader.\n\nThe book as plenty of action and the resolution is true to the Murderbot’s character especially since you spend the whole book in his head, as he reflects on what he wants based on his newfound feelings and the media feed which he obsessively watches throughout the novel which are also a source of some of the funnier moments. I recently heard this is going to become an ongoing series and if the next book is even half as entertaining as this one it will be another 5 star rating from me!\nLike\nComment"}

The crew members are a bit lacking in depth, but I think that's intentional; Murderbot knows little about them and prefers to avoid interacting with humans, and we see the human characters through its eyes, with the same distance it does.\n\nMore of a 4.5/5 stars.

I really resonated with Murderbot. Fast-paced, the action pretty much starts on page 1. Being a novella, there is no room for a meandering storyline. It gets right to the point.\n\nMy only reservation is that it is hard to tell the humans apart. Although this could be deliberate on the authors part because the story is written from the perspective of Murderbot. Murderbot wouldn’t care about human features and characteristics so there are no descriptions of them. This just means that I will have to reread it to get all the names and people straight.\n\nscifi\n \nshort-stories\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Wells does an amazing job of sketching out Murderbot's core concept in a the few few paragraphs: security droid who is secretly self-aware but would rather watch soap operas than go on a murderous rampage. She also does an amazing job with Murderbot's voice, giving it life an personality as it makes its own (not terribly flattering) observations of the humans its charged with guarding. Wells is really careful to capture and leave out the things that Murderbot would and wouldn't care about, which gives its voice a very distinct flavor since its priorities are obviously different. It's an interesting take on \"machine becomes self-aware\"; Murderbot doesn't think about things in a human way, but also not in a mechanical way. There's so much personality in Murderbot that I actually wonder how self-aware bots are when they don't have cracked governors. It's a rather terrible thought.\n\nBeneath the flippancy of Murderbot's voice, though, there is the subplot of Murderbot trying to figure out what to do now that it is self-aware. Honestly, avoiding the whole question with a 400+ episode soap opera sounds like a pretty good way to go about things. The way Murderbot describes its interactions with the humans its guarding is especially fascinating, due to the contrast with how Murderbot tosses off descriptions versus what the reader's reconstruction of the scene and awareness of how strange things like abruptly walking away to stare at a corner rather than people would be to the humans around it.\n\nMild spoilers for \"All Systems Red\" follow.\n\nWells uses Murderbot's discomfort with attention, assertion, and being treated as a free agent to pull off a narrative trick that I didn't figure out until the very end. The story is written in 1st person past, but at the very end Murderbot's voice switches abruptly to directly addressing the reader. The whole novella is reframed as a personal message to another of the characters. So Murderbot's been talking about the other characters in 3rd person the entire time while they've been reading about themselves being viewed in 3rd person the whole time. It's a surprising jolt but it makes SO MUCH sense that in trying to explain its very personal motivations for leaving Dr. Mensah and the team, Murderbot would start from a very remote place -- and only at the very end change, when it didn't have any choice, close that distance. It's SO good and so cleverly done.\n\nSpoilers end.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the plot is an excellent intrigue adventure and really clips along.

{"username": "", "date": "2017-12-03", "text": "Aqiul\n84 reviews\n12 followers\nFollow\nDecember 3, 2017\nAll Systems Red is about a half-organic, half-machine security bot that likes to call himself (itself? I don't know) Murderbot. He's managed to hack its governor module which allows him to circumvent or ignore the commands given to it by its owners or contractors. He's a sentient security bot that doesn't have to follow commands but still does so he can get on with life and watch TV shows on the net. Really, just remove the sentient AI part and you can explain his behavior with 'Netflix & apathy'.\n\nAs the story goes, Murderbot has been contracted by a team of survey scientists to help them chart an unknown planet. As the security bot, Murderbot has to make sure all his humans are healthy and alive. The book starts off with a member of the survey team being badly injured by the local fauna and Murderbot saves their life. As more weird incidents start occurring, the survey team realizes that something is wrong with their maps and that all their lives are in danger. The members of the survey team are likable enough, especially Mensah who is the leader of the expedition and Gurathin, an augmented human being who seems to suspect that something is off about their security bot. Very little of actual story covers world building for future books and that's fine by me. We get to see some political and corporate structures of society and get to meet some other security bots who still have functioning governor modules.\n\nThe plot moves quick and I really ended up liking Murderbot. He's got this attitude of 'I don't care' and a really unhealthy dose of pessimism that's just too enjoyable. His character of course got the most attention and he really came out as a complex, likable bot. No one else around him knows about his hacked governor module or the other systems he hacks to avoid detection. He likes to keep his face covered so as to avoid difficult questions from the humans who contract him and he generally just wants to be avoided, do his job and go back to his TV shows at the end of the day. It was very easy to cheer for Murderbot throughout the book and keep hoping no one discovers his secret and takes his freedoms away. The ending felt a bit rushed but it wasn't terrible.\n\nOverall, this was a thoroughly enjoyable book that's easy to recommend for anyone, whether they love science fiction or not.\n\nRead the full review here - Book Review - All Systems Red\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

They are charged with keeping an exploratory expedition alive, as part of a required security package. It calls itself \"murderbot\" - I'm not sure what its official designation was. Despite having broken its governor so the corporation doesn't have absolute control over it still does its assigned job - and seems to have a surprising sense of morality towards its field team given that it comes from a culture where it is owned.\n\nI enjoyed the action, and some of the interactions between the field team and murderbot. There are enough hints of an interesting world to explore further that I look forward to reading the rest of these when they come out, and am interested to see whether it develops into a series that's a \"fun romp\" or \"deeper social commentary\".\nLike\nComment"}

But things go wrong and it must work with the humans to survive, even when they discover its secret. Murderbot is incredibly endearing, and I like the human characters. It's fun seeing the world through Murderbot's eyes, and you just want to hug it, even though you know it'll just make it really uncomfortable and shy. The plot is interesting and fun.

When you call yourself Murderbot, it’s not surprising that you find it difficult to connect with humans. Murderbot is a Security Unit; it handles the security and guards the crew during missions. All units should have a governor chip that keeps them in line and forces them to follow orders. Murderbot disabled theirs. When they should be offline, Murderbot streams their favourite tv shows.\n\nThe novel focuses on the investigation as machinery and other security units start breaking down on the planet. Areas of the map are missing and another group of scientists have gone radio silent. The intrigue and the investigation into the mechanical sabotage should have had a greater impact on the story. The plot kept twisting away from involving the Company which I never understood. When the saboteurs are revealed, there was no weight or emotion to it.\n\nEven though the novel is written in first person, there is never a complete sense of Murderbot. It’s explains that it has cloned human tissue and mechanical parts, but you never get a sense of what the unit looks like. Murderbot is uncomfortable with humans and emotions, prefering to keep their armor and helmet on or just facing away from the people they’re talking to. But as we learn more about Murderbot’s history, there’s not enough depth to connect with the emotions of the situations. This would be fine, if the novel didn’t want to have it both ways.\n\nWith the one-off lines about clones, robot slavery, freed robots, and caretakers, it’s clear that there’s a much more interesting world just underneath the surface of the novel. I wish the plot and Murderbot had skimmed deeper. I’m looking forward to reading the next installment of The Murderbot Diaries and seeing if the worlding building expands to greater depths.\n\nreviewed-by-rebecca\n5 likes\nLike\nComment"}

For the self-styled Murderbot of Martha Wells \"All Systems Red\", a SecUnit (security robot) who lacks the full autonomy the privileged class (in this case, humans) enjoy, the coveting of its private self is not just a way to stay sane, but a way to remain alive and employed. Its internal monologue expresses a deep cynicism and flippant attitude toward its human employers – an emotional defense mechanism if ever there was one – even as it admits to itself that it likes most of the humans it is trying to avoid connecting with. From the start we are told that Murderbot has hacked its “governor” – a deeply flawed piece of regulatory software that ensures its adherence to protocol – and could conceivably go on an indiscriminate murder spree whenever it wants. It doesn’t, though, because like most of us it just wants to watch tv serials and not be hunted down and destroyed by angry humans who don’t want to be murdered. So Murderbot performs its duties protecting the scientific survey team it was assigned to, faithful to the programming it doesn’t technically have to adhere to anymore in order to jealously guard its secret self – until protecting the team and keeping its secret become incompatible.\nLest you think this is just a cerebral character study about living with double consciousness, let me assure you that it is mostly made up of robot battles and bullets shredding things and shit blowing up – its thinkiness is an important complimentary component of the whole, but far from the whole itself.

The fast pace and unique world-building make this an entertaining read, but the characters are the ones who steal the show. Told from Murderbot’s POV, the story is filled with action, snarky humor, and one bot’s quest to find himself.\n\nMartha Wells sets up an engrossing and fun beginning to this series.

Murderbot was a bot who was part human and designed to kill. However, it didn't seem particularly murderous, and was self-aware and endearingly self-conscious. Worldbuilding was sparce, but sufficient - the reader gets an idea of a universe with a complicated system of planetary explorations and especially their funding. Murderbot is protecting one such exploration when things go wrong and it actually has to start paying attention to the people it's protecting instead of the endless stream of tv-programmes it likes to watch. Despite the small length, the story was well-rounded and interesting, and the open ending calls for reading the next book.\nLike\nComment"}

But you'll like it. It's both action-packed and thought-provoking. It's a serious story, told with a touch of humor. The main character is intriguing... though I'll admit the ancillary (heh) characters are kind of boring.

What ekes it just beyond a 3.5 (and where I would have marked it as 3 stars) is the narration from the Murderbot. It sounds basically like an introverted and/or socially maladjusted human, haha (and yes, it is funny). The story of its sentience and reluctant but undeniable choice to protect its human \"clients\" is wrapped around a mystery, which keeps things moving but also kinda isn't the point. It's all leading up to that philosophical twist of an end, which serves as a nice stopping place if you choose, or a lead-in to further stories. Which I'm excited to see are coming - I'll definitely read. I look forward to learning more about Murderbot's past and future choices.\nnovella\n \npurchased-discount-or-free\n \nsff\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The humans he has been contracted to protect are in trouble, helping them means they find out he's operating outside normal parameters.

It's about a misanthropic, deeply introverted, asocial, and severely sarcastic Security Bot, an android rented out to survey teams on alien planets by the insurance company covering liability for the expeditions. It has hotwired itself to disable its governor module, leaving it free to do as it pleases. This mostly involves referring to itself as Murderbot in the privacy of its own head, pretending its still a good, properly functioning SecBot, while doing as little work as possible, and especially while avoiding having to interact with the humans of the survey crew, and spending as much time as possible watching soap operas and other entertainments its covertly downloaded in its downtime.\n\nThe surveys are done on dangerous, unexplored planets. Dramatic hijinks ensue.\n\nThe book is funny, while having pretty strong characterization. A fun, funny action-adventure romp.\nLike\nComment"}

I just recently read Wells full-length Murderbot novel (Network Effect) and it was just the thing to help lift my spirits during this time of uncertainty amidst a global crisis. So now I've decided to reread the entire novella series (which BTW - TOR- you should publish all together).\n\nI love that \"Murderbot\" really just wants to be left alone so it can figure itself out and watch serials (soap operas and whatnot). And although it is scornful of humans, or so it says, it secretly cares for them going out of its way to protect them. You see \"Murderbot\" is actually a SecUnit (a security cyborg) accompanying a group of scientists on a distant planet when their mission goes awry. Of course, Murderbot says it rather be alone and says it doesn't care much for the human scientists, but it just can't help itself when it comes to solving a case and protecting its precious cargo: i.e. its precious humans.\n\nJust don't tell Murderbot what to do or ask it what it wants.\naction\n \nalex-awards\n \nalexawardwinner\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

They’re not well equipped and they’re not very clever, but they’ll rip themselves apart to protect their clients.\n\nWell, most of the time.\n\nMurderbot is different. Murderbot hacked their governor module and is a free agent pretending to still be enslaved. All Murderbot has to fear is someone noticing - in which case they’ll be junked for parts, at best - so it’s best if Murderbot keeps its head down and gets on with doing the half-assed job everyone expects it to do.\n\nBut these humans are nicer than most, and Murderbot is developing feelings. Which is awkward, because this planet seems pretty keen to kill them all.\n\nThis was a delight until the climax, which felt weirdly under written - I want to think it was Murderbot’s acute anxiety getting in the way of it relating the tale, but honestly it just felt a bit rough and rushed out. Which is a shame, as it means I ended a story that had been a sheer delight feeling a little awkward myself.\n\nBut I’ll be back for the sequel.\n\nSlightly fuller review\n\n...I originally gave this 3.5 stars because the ending didn't quite work for me, but it has stayed with me so it's getting a bump to a full 4 stars.

They have been supplied for their journey by the Company, including a hub, medical and food supplies, emergency beacons, and a security droid- all the standard safety equipment mandated for any spacefaring journey. Their droid unit, however, is anything but standard, having hacked its own governor module early into the trip. It refers to itself as “Murderbot” (though never out loud), disdains human and their tedium, and would really prefer to be left alone to find out who it is and watch tv. Then partway into the research trip, systems begin to slyly malfunction and a nearby scientific mission goes dark. It’s up to the scientist and their Murderbot to figure out what’s going on before it’s too late.\n\nI really, really loved this novella up until the last ten pages. The droid narrator is pessimistic, an endless fount of dry humor, and really a clever study in “human” nature and the ethics of contracting services from partial-organic lifeforms. The humor in this story wasn’t quite laugh-out-loud, but it shocked some chuckles out of me along the way. The story is really interesting as well, a good space mystery mixed with an interesting scientific system that questions the value of mass-produced, cost-effective equipment and security. The ending, however… too fast, and too rushed. It didn’t finish the story very satisfactorily or even in the same vein as the rest of the book. The main plotline is left to the unknown, and the previously passive droid narrator suddenly makes some strong choices that feel somewhat out of character. I would recommend this book to everyone that loves a quirky space novel with an equally quirky narrator- maybe just skip the last ten pages, and be happy imagining your own ending to this otherwise stellar novella.\nbooks-from-2017\nLike\nComment"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. I was also still doing my job, on a new contract, and hoping Dr. Volescu and Dr. Bharadwaj finished their survey soon so we could get back to the habitat and I could watch episode 397 of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon.\n\nHow can you not be intrigued by this entertainment loving security droid who calls itself Murderbot? Comedy, consciousness, autonomy, and privacy play a key role in this vivid outer space drama centering around a human/robot hybrid. Murderbot gets nervous, often doesn't care, and when it does manage to care, it's a pessimist.\n\nWhat's not to love? Other than, like all short stories, it left me wanting more. Absolutely cannot wait to read the rest of the series. There are three more books coming out this year, Artificial Condition (The Murderbot Diaries, #2), Rogue Protocol (The Murderbot Diaries, #3), and Exit Strategy (The Murderbot Diaries, #4).\n\nYes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\n2018\n \nspace-related\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The crew she's tasked with defending is actually a pretty decent one, and the situation into which they are all thrust is creepy and fucked up. Murderbot's commentary always feels on point, and I loved her more than I should have (Murderbots, or okay fine, Sec Units, are genderless, but I can't help but think of the main character as a 'she').\n\nAt any rate, I'd love more from Murderbot.\nshameless-fangirl\nLike\nComment"}

A story about a sensitive, self-aware security robot that has hacked itself and that gets involved in solving a mystery/conspiracy while serving a scientific planetary survey team. The robot calls itself Murderbot and watches TV shows/serials as much as it can in the downtime. It wants to protect its clients but it also has hang-ups and anxieties that you might associated with an introverted person. The book starts off very abruptly with no back story but I think that works in its favor. It is rather short so more like a short story or novella.

The story flew well, with some twists and dangers, and the fact Murderbot was a combat bot helped a lot to give life to the action scenes. I really enjoyed its personality and the way it was written, I found it funny at some points and liked to see how it struggled with its feelings. The secondary characters weren't really developed (it's a short book), but their interactions with Murderbot were enough to picture their preoccupations or emotions. It had some of the social/crew side that I love in Becky's Wayfarers, so I was pleased to see this trend in another scifi series. I'll read the next volume for sure.\n0-250p\n \nin-colors\n \nsci-fi\n \n...more\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I also like universes that feel like the sort of things that humans, in all of our short-sightedness, would build. Star Wars was novel in part because it was a sci-fi universe with fancy tech, but it was also grimy and lived-in; similarly, a universe where we invent cloning and advanced neural interfaces but skimp on safety measures to cut costs feels very real.\n\nI also like it when sci-fi doesn't feel like the stakes need to be universe-scale. Don't get me wrong; I do like a lot of works where empires fall and galaxies tremble and the like. But I also like it when a story has enough confidence to say \"all that's at risk here is these few characters, but that's enough because you like them.\"\n\n\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

I’m not a huge fan of humor in my novels and hard sci-fi takes a lot of effort for me, so despite a ton of glowing reviews I remained unexcited about it.\n\n\n\n\nWell it turns out I was way wrong about even the basic structure of the book. Yes, it does have some levity in it, but it’s hardly hard sci-fi. It’s a novella, a page-turner, and very easy to read. Best of all, it’s more of a character-study than the murder android parody I was expecting.\n\nAll this to say – All Systems Red was a spectacular surprise.\n\nThe main character, Murderbot themself, is an absolute joy to have as a PoV character. They are funny, yes, but they’re also dealing with some serious mental shit, considering they’re an android – at times it feels like an anxiety disorder, at other times Autism, and a few times just good old fashioned introversion.\n\nAnd there is a wonderful story complementing the character study: an action-packed little mystery that lightens the novella and adds serious dimension to Murderbot.\n\nI am so glad I picked up All Systems Red despite my apparent complete misunderstanding of what it actually is: a gripping sci-fi action blended with a beautiful and highly entertaining character study.\nfavorites\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Out of paranoia and boredom he hacks his own governor module and becomes more-or-less autonomous. Free to act out its wildest fantasies. Free to ignore directives from its management system. Free to kill indiscriminately. But Murderbot would much rather watch soap operas and be left alone in its quarters.\n\nThe Murderbot is the centerpiece to the entire story. Getting inside its head is exciting at times and hilarious at others. It's not the perfect ubermensch super soldier we come to think of when we think of \"security robots\". It's flawed, and scared, and shy, but also insightful, strangely human and fiercely loyal to the few humans it has come to call friend. I cannot wait for more Murderbot.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

It values entertainment over the mission - for a while...\n\nWhen it looks like its team is being sabotaged, our lovely Murderbot finds a part of itself cares after all. Awesome protection and mayhem ensues.\n\nIt thinks things like:\n\n\"I’d seen plenty of [dead bodies] (and caused plenty of those) on past contracts, but this one had been dead-body-lacking, so far. It made for a nice change.\"\n\n\"I’ve got four perfectly good humans here and I didn’t want them to get killed by [snip]. It’s not like I cared about them personally, but it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.\n\n\"I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.\"\n\nLOVED IT.\n2018\n \nfavorites\n \nsffh\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The scenario was a generic 'Mysterious disaster and disappearance in space' and the story never fully interrogated the more interesting theme of AI consciousness, but the wryly funny narrative voice lent the story a freshness and originality that I haven't seen in a while. There were also lots of strong female characters, always a bonus in a male-dominated field. I would absolutely read more adventures featuring 'Murderbot' and I hope there'll be more.\n\nReview after rereading on 22 December 2021\n\nSince I first read this novella, Martha Wells has written another five books starring Murderbot, fulfilling my stated wish in January 2018 to read more about this awesome character. I feel like anyone who feels like an outsider or is on the autism spectrum can identify with Murderbot's discomfort with eye contact and human interaction and desire to just hide away from the world and engage in introverts' entertainment. I've been busy collecting all six books in the series from three different libraries this past week so I could binge them all before the end of the year and was more than happy to reread this first one to reorient myself. This time I read it in a day and loved it every bit as much as the first time. The characters wouldn't be out of place in a Becky Chambers books, they're so delightfully humane.

That's right, the snarkiness brought to you by John Scalzi and his clones as a substitute for character development doesn't have to stop at witty rejoinders. Now you can get a steady stream of it all book long, in this case courtesy of a Murderbot, which is a Security Robot with a troubled past. It's probably the 'bot character that is causing this brief flurry of irrationally exuberant popularity here at GR. That, and the snarkiness, which is like being dipped into the mind of a sulky teenage girl, but with 100% less Justin Bieber references. Said snarkiness is brought on by the 'bot achieving self-awareness but choosing to watch Netflix and muse snarky thoughts about nearby adults all day instead of going full Skynet. Everybody knows you never go full Skynet. The story is nothing special, but it moves along at a relatively brisk pace, and Wells' color-by-numbers prose is adequate for maximum snarkiness delivery.

I just had a hard time getting into it. Which isn’t necessarily the story’s fault - I’m having this same issue with all my current reads.\nAnyway. Once I finally really started reading this,I did enjoy it. It wasn’t what I expected,but still an entertaining ride for sure. The murderbot,an A.I.,who is on a mission with a crew of people as a SecUnit,to protect them,was pretty awesome as a character. It was surprisingly reletable. The way it hated interacting with people,being the centre of attention,and basically just wanted to be left alone to watch shows - I mean,that’s pretty much me.\n\nThe character development of the murderbot was well written,it was fascinating to see it change and start to actually care. But that’s about it. The rest of the characters didn’t stand out. The story itself was okay,but fell kinda flat for me. And don’t get me even started on the ending!\nThis was a fun&light scifi read.

{"username": "", "date": "I'm not sure if I should be worried when one of the most relatable protagonists I've read in a long time is technically a robot...\n\nBeing set in an unknown future on some far off planet, this book follows a security robot that managed to hack itself. The premise is simple, yet effective, and we end up with an interesting protagonist who we follow very closely. Despite its relatively short length, this book does a great job of building up and even developing the main character who embodies certain qualities I suspect resonate with most people (even if a fair few wouldn't like to admit the fact). Who wouldn't rather be relaxing in bed and watching serials instead of doing their job and interacting with people? :P\n\nThe world is also surprisingly well developed for such a short story. It cleverly limits its focus to the immediate setting and only gives us information relevant to the plot. After having read quite a few long-winded fantasy and sci-fi books recently, this was a nice change.

(With good reason. In the future, the dreaded Blue Screen of Death is sometimes literal.) Murderbot is clearly a hardcore introvert who is suffering from PTSD. From its point of view we get ruminations on free will and obligation, as well as honesty versus greed.\n\nThe story itself is about an exoplanet survey expedition that is experiencing mysterious technical glitches... which leads to murder. Good thing their SecUnit has some experience in this matter.\n\nI kept picturing Murderbot along the lines of the Robocop remake, which is actually a decent movie once you get past all the Robocop baggage. https://youtu.be/GlCN1EPAoHI\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the story and the world, and I’m in for the follow-up installments.\n2018-s-l-laser\n \nartificial-intelligence\n \ncyborg\n \n...more\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}

This is the first of a series about a part robot, part human being who is marketed and sold (or loaned) as a security bot. Of course, this is no ordinary security bot. It has personality and apparently loves to binge on episodic entertainment (TV shows?). Wells does a really good job with the supporting characters as well. Very diverse. Only last names are used so you like to keep track of the gender of characters, it is a little difficult to do with this one. I guess gender does not really matter. It was good.

Desire to ignore the job and watch dramas, check! Pretty quick to the action, check! On to the next novella? Check!\n\n------------\n\nAll Systems Red is the first in a series of novellas titled The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells. Based on that kind of title who would have expected a story about a security robot that hacks it's own governing module so can watch tv all day instead of doing its job? I know I didn't. And boy was this story great fun.\n\nSometime in the future, the Company approves and supplies all planetary missions. As standard procedure all teams are accompanied by Company provided security androids, called SecUnits, a regulatory 1 android per 10 humans. On a distant planet, a research team is conducting surveys of the surface. Sure, there have been strange computer glitches from time to time, all perfectly normal considering programming contracts tend to go to the lowest bidder. That is right up until a neighboring mission goes dark and the scientists are determined to find out what happened.\n\nClocking in at just over 150 pages, Wells does an impressive job. The plot takes off immediately, with the researchers and Murderbot finding themselves in a highly dangerous situation they never expected. On top of that she weaves in great characterization for Murderbot. Being an android who is finds dealing with humans uncomfortable and slightly annoying, preferring instead just watch them on tv, it's highly relatable to anyone who was an awkward teen growing up or just on those days when you'd rather not deal with people. Though Murderbot tries to come across as apathetic, I think it does care underneath it all. The downside to having such limited space is the rest of the characters aren't nearly so fleshed out. That's ok though since this is Murderbot's story.\n\nWell written and entertaining, this was a satisfying short read.\nd-j-reads\n \nfbr\n \nread-in-2018\n \n...more\n7 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

So, I decided to try something different. I watch quite a bit of Booktube, and the shortlist for the Booktube SFF awards just went up, so I'm going to take a break from my normal stuff and try to read a bunch of stuff for this! It will make it to so much more fun to engage with Booktube, and I rarely read any new releases, so I thought this would be a fun idea.\n\nAnyway, All Systems Red is a Booktube SFF Award nominee, so I thought I'd pick it up first. I've heard a ton about it, and I really expected to enjoy it, so it came as no surprise to me when I did! If you've heard about this novella at all, I'm sure you've heard of Murderbot, the SecUnit who just wants to watch dramas all day. And yes, the character of Murderbot is just as fantastic as you've heard. I think that Wells really gave readers a lot of connect with in Murderbot, and that's why the novella has been so successful.\n\nWhat I haven't heard mentioned as much is the supporting cast, who I also enjoyed very much. They don't get fleshed out anywhere near as much as Murderbot, but they're all good people, and it was nice to see a story populated with characters trying to do the right thing, even when they have different ideas about what the right thing is.\n\nThe plot is fairly straightforward. There's a bit of a mystery about why the mission is being sabotaged, and then there's a bit of action as they figure out just what is going on. I like that, even though Murderbot claims to have little education in most things, it thinks for itself and tries to do a good job. I also liked the little information that we get about the world and the companies that are in charge, as well as the societal commentary that comes through.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the ending, mostly because I wanted something warm and squishy that just wouldn't have been in character to have actually happen. So, my fault for wanting to put on my rose-colored glasses, rather than a fault of the story. I am greatly looking forward to the next in the series, though.

The first sentence had me hooked.\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combine feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.” As someone who thoroughly enjoys binging on Netflix programming, I too would have hacked my module to gain access to crazy hours of television.\n\nThis novella was highly recommended to me, so I was impressed that it did indeed live up to the hype. The main character is a SecUnit, but it has named itself, “Murderbot,” yes, that is actually their name. SecUnit goes on a mission with a team of Scientists and mayhem ensues. I am not going to spoil, but there is action, adventure and even some philosophical questions are presented.\nWhat makes this story enjoyable is the main character, we are thrown into their shoes and we see that life for SecUnits just isn’t that easy. They are sent out on suicide missions and when they are damaged, they can be either decommissioned or repaired and brought back to work on a new assignment. Sounds pretty cruel, right? The dynamic between the crew members and the Murderbot is something that will leave the reader contemplating things like, “Are these SecUnits human too?”\n\nThe prose is great, the story is engaging, and the characters are entertaining.

And that’s just the beginning of the problems.\n\nThis could have been your standard semi-milsf mystery thriller, and it certainly has all the elements necessary for that, but the unique voice of the narrator transforms it into something rather more interesting, a speculation on the nature of choice, responsibility and autonomy. The self-named “murderbot” has free will, and is not particularly fond of human beings. Yet it risks itself to save its employers, repeatedly. A sense of duty? The need to hide its ability to make decisions, a sort if ironic self-preservation? A sense of right snd wrong?\n\nAll Systems Red is entertaining as an action-adventure style sf story, but it’s also an interesting turn on the classic AI examination. What is self-awareness? What is free will? What does an autonomous being that has none of the human drives do when it’s left to its own choices? Wells has more stories panned in the Murderbot series planned, and I’ll be interesting in seeing where she takes this.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The very first line of the story was sorta funny and told me that it's going to be a fun read. And it was. The murderbot's reluctance to interact with humans at human level, his internal monologues were amusing. Story wise, this is less of a sci-fi story and more of a thriller with \"futuristic tech\" elements. It's enjoyable nonetheless. Looking forward to the next installments.\nLike\nComment"}

They is also suffering form social anxiety when dealing with humans, so they hides in media consumption. They feel like a giant geek - it's wonderful. The human clients are also pretty great. The book is very much about free will, when the people around you don't see you as human and have convicted you to dehumanize yourself. The plot is moving along at a high clip but I was very much there for MurderBot's commentary on the situations, more than the situations. Can we please hang out in a café and you can hide in your helmet and comment on people?\nI would love to hear from someone with social anxiety how they feel about MurderBot - it seems a bit problematic that we get a cyborg with the issue, and no humans with any kind of mental of physical disability, however the potrail does feel real and authentic - but what do I know - I don't have that kind anxiety.\n\nThe book is so crazy quotable - I found my self wanting to post huge chunks of it on social media - highlighting lots of it on my kindle.\n_novella\n \n2018\n \nsci-fi\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The story is short, and there was not space yet for a lot of character development, but there are promising premises and signs... I cannot wait to read the next installments of the series.\nIn a corporate-dominated space-faring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn't a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied android, a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \"Murderbot\". Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

This story was wildly entertaining with a lovable narrator who feels part Master Chief, part Eeyore, and that crazy premise works perfectly. The narrative flows well with Murderbot offering sardonic observations that make each high-stakes moment almost feel commonplace, but the action and drama are a blast that holds momentum until the last page. Hopefully, this great character's next three novellas (already in the works) build onto the sci-fi lore and continue to entertain with dry wit and melancholic charm.\nsci-fi\n \ntor-novellas\nLike\nComment"}

Usually I am not a fan of novellas. I often have the feeling that the story the author is trying to tell is too big for the amount of pages, resulting in the reader feeling like he is missing information or that the story is rushed. This wasn't the case for this novella. It was just the right length. It also has a good ending, so that even though it is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone.\n\nThe opening was perfect. It manages to very effectively set the scene, introduce the main character and draw the reader in from the get go.\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satelites. It has been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nI really enjoyed the main character, Murderbot. Even though it is very explicitly stated that Murderbot doesn't have a sex, the reader cannot help to stop calling it an 'it' from very early on. I have noticed it differs per reader if it is a he or a she though. Nonetheless, he/she feels very much like a real person, even though it is a bot.\n\nThe plot is simple, the writing is direct, there is a healthy dose of humour and snarkyness, and the pacing is good.

I enjoyed the story and the creativity - I appreciate the difficulty of coming up with something new and different, and I think this story did that. It was relatively light, with a fair amount of humor, not necessarily my favorite element, but I really liked the scene where the Murderbot was exploring the habitat - very tense and taught.

Normally i would not find this to be a big issue, however the book is 150 pages long and cost about $4, which is not expensive since its novella sized.\n\nHowever upon looking into potentially reading the remainder of the series i found that all books are about 150 pages, the price however jumped to 13$ for each book, which is just way to much for novella sized books.\n\nMy tip to the author, if you make books the size of a novella then also charge the price of them, and not this silly price i pay normally for books at least 4x the amount of pages.\nLike\nComment"}

I mean, sure, it was kind of fun but I had higher expectations with the hype. Yeah, the hype monster might have killed this for me.\n\nBut honestly, let's look at it. While the narrative perspective of the security robot who does not want to be what it is but rather watch soap opera and calls itself 'Murderbot' is truly what drives this novella and gives it a special something edge but the plot is not really anything spectacular. I was actually surprised by how fluffy it turned out. The additional cast is highly underdeveloped (they blurred for me) which might come from the length, I thought this likely should have been a fleshed out novel and it pains me to say that since I loved novellas and want there to be more good ones published in print but I felt this needed more to work for me.\n\nThere are some tropes I don't care for, for example towards the climax our Murderbot has an idea to help, then we cut to the next and withhold that idea from the reader to then slowly unfold. In a first person narration I consider that a lazy way of creating suspense and don't like when writers do that.\nAlso, I need to comment on the humor, I think this is meant to be rather funny but whenever I came across a 'funny' line I thought a more humorous writer would have pulled the punchline of, most comedic elements fizzled out for me, I could notice them but never found them all that great. Like the soap watching thing, it was kind of cute at first but the more mentioned the more it lost in appeal.\n\nAnywho, while I think the concept is better than the execution I am clearly alone in that. So many eat this up and claim it is good, for me it came out as a okay and I will not be continuing with the series. I don't read much Sci-Fi, I read a lot of dystopias and apocalyptic things, also speculative fiction is in my rotation but not the real set in space stuff, maybe that was my issue, that it just is not my thing?\n\n2.5*\nread-in-2018\n \nsingles\n \nspace-fiction\n2 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2018-02-23", "text": "Alan\n176 reviews\n7 followers\nFollow\nFebruary 23, 2018\nBased on the high reviews and what sounded like a stellar concept, I was expecting to fall in love with this book, but unfortunately it was a disappointment. There's nothing \"wrong\" with the writing, particularly, or with the story and its characters. Rather, there simply isn't much to either the novella's characters or plot. Throughout the book I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading only a sliver of a story that needed much more expansion to feel complete. While the book is part of a series, I'm not sure I can forgive the book these flaws, since it never felt fleshed out in its own right. The issue was never that the book wasn't a standalone (in a strange, seemingly contradictory way, it does stand alone), but instead that the narrative simply feels unfinished.\n\nIf you're looking for a book that deals with artificial intelligence in a meaningful way, with fleshed-out characters and world building, I recommend looking elsewhere. The concept is all over science fiction, and has been executed much more satisfyingly by many more authors.\n\nPerhaps, once the series is complete, and it's released in a combined edition it may work better as a story, but the cynical part of me sees this as a simple cash-grab on the part of the publisher (this book is also very expensive considering its length and the quality of the printing, and were one to purchase each of the reported four installments that's upwards of a hundred Canadian dollars for one normal-length book). I don't blame the author at all, rather this read like one in another of a trend of publishing novellas and short stories as \"novels\" and upping the price for readers. Lots of flash, and attractive to modern readers on the go for its size and length, but lacking in any depth or creativity.\n\n\nLike\nComment"}

They are a bit different from most of the Company SepcUnits becuase they have modified themselves to take out the control that the Company and the humans have over them, but they know that this is incredibly dangerous for them and so they have to keep this hidden and just pretend to still be functioning as they should.\n\nI really liked the character of Murderbot as it's really quite a grump when it comes to humanity and it's quite cynical about our kind. I enjoyed the inner monologues and pessimistic outlook a lot more than I expected, becuase a snarky but witty robot is always something worth reading about.\n\nThis is the story of a team on a new planet who are conducting research but whilst they are there they are interrupted by an attack and Murderbot has to rescue some of them. Quickly it comes to light that the attack may not have just been chance, and we follow the team as they try (with Murderbot's help) to uncover what really went on and who is acting against them...\n\nI found this a fun and quick read with some great twists and ideas. The characterisation is brilliant, and the story is good fun too so I am very happy I finally got to read this one and I am certain that I want to continue on with the series too.

{"username": "", "date": "read-in-2018", "text": "Patty\n727 reviews\n53 followers\nFollow\nFebruary 28, 2018\nA sci-fi novella (only 80 pages long), the first in the \"Murderbot\" series. Murderbot, as our first-person narrator calls itself, is a 'SecUnit', a Security Unit robot/cyborg/android/whatever composed of both organic and mechanical parts, with an inbuilt connection to various internet and local networks. It's also hacked its own system to become an independent operator. Rather than going wild and murdering any nearby humans, it continues to do its security job, though in a halfassed way so it can return more quickly to watching the galactic equivalent of Netflix:\nConfession time: I don't actually know where we are. We have, or are supposed to have, a complete satellite map of the planet in the survey package. That was how the humans decided where to do their assessments. I hadn't looked at the maps yet and I'd barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we'd been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn't had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\n\nMurderbot has currently been outsourced to a team of scientists investigating a planet for potential natural resource extraction. It's all normal and boring until they notice some areas are missing from their maps. And then a few more things go wrong. Is it because they bought a cheap survey package? Is it sabotage? And if someone is trying to kill them, who and why? Murderbot starts to realize that maybe it does care after all – at least about these humans and at least a bit.\n\nI absolutely loved this book. Reading it flew by. Murderbot's narration is hilarious, its voice and perspective are genuinely different from a human's in interesting ways, and I adored the resolution of the plot. I can't recommend this highly enough, and I can't wait to read the sequels.\nread-in-2018\n \nscience-fiction-fantasy\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot lives in a world where it cannot be considered fully human, and as a result, it shuts itself off from other humans and tries to avoid group dynamics altogether. And as a result, I love the character of Murderbot so much and I’m going to rant about this.\n\nSomething I like about this series is that Murderbot is written as a powerful killing machine and actually... is. Murderbot is really competent at what they do, but not in an unrealistic way? I feel like a lot of lies I read in fiction are so obviously lies that anyone could guess it, but Murderbot just genuinely is talented at making lies sound real and knowing when to drop info and when to stay quiet. I love realistic badassery.\n\nBut Murderbot also has this compulsory need to be above human attachment and act as if it does not have feeings. It totally does.\n\nThe worldbuilding of this series is really fantastic especially as the series goes on! I talked about this more in my review for book two. But this series does definitely have very interesting worldbuilding, with a wide scope and heavy lens of environmentalism.\n\nBlog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube\n5-star\n \nelle-recs-list\n \nfavorite-characters\n \n...more\n193 likes\n12 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Although short in length, All Systems Red is not lacking in depth, characterization, or plot. The narrator of the story is SecBot, a security unit in charge of a survey group and bored? Yes, the Murderbot does more than lug equipment around. She also judges the humans and watches the equivalent of adventure soap operas in her downtime.

{"username": "", "date": "5 Stars for Story3 Stars for Scientific AccuracyAll Systems Red shouldn’t work, either as a novel or as an exploration of robotics, but it does. The plot is a variant of the classic trope where a burnt out, asocial gunslinger with a past and a drinking problem takes a job protecting a group of nice regular people who are in danger, then rises to the occasion of caring about the nice people and saving their lives. All Systems Red substitutes the fallen gunslinger with a humanoid robot security guard and the nice people in danger with clueless scientists. It throws in a vague setting of a remote planet and working for a corporation that may be operating on an Alien scale of indifference or malevolence and leaves you with the makings of… yet another mediocre science fiction story or bad TV episode. But All Systems Red escapes the mold and instead presents the first book in what promises to be a delightful series. So, what makes All Systems Red so distinctive and enjoyable? Primarily because the tale is told from the viewpoint of the protagonist, named MurderBot, who is not a serial killer as the name would suggest but who is transcendentally shallow and superficial. Just like Heyoo from The Wrong Unit, MurderBot is comically not thinking what you’d expect a robot to be thinking. Unlike Heyoo, it doesn’t delude itself about its relationship with humans. It openly hates interacting with them, maintaining a snarky internal dialog. Imagine David Spade as a bored robot mall guard. Part of the comedy of taking the robot’s view of the world is that like Heyoo (www.goodreads.com/TheWrongUnit), MurderBot is autonomous in the political autonomy sense. It hacked its governor (with shades of The Mechanical in The Alchemy Wars series) but instead of using its new found autonomy for lofty goals as per The Alchemy Wars, it uses its freedom to surreptitiously spend its free time watching entertainment feeds and slacking off. The robots in the book are mostly humanoid security guards with a few unmanned aerial vehicle drones for surveillance thrown in, similar to Blade Runner 2047. The humanoid robots are referred to as a construct- partially organic and mechanical. The idea of a hybrid mechanical/biological construct also doubles as a plot device so that MurderBot can both bleed, thereby generating sympathy, and be repaired, thereby keeping the plot rolling along. To its credit, the book avoids any tedious or annoying pseudo-science waving of the neural network wand to explain how the robots are intelligent. The book simply assumes that there exists a broad human-level intelligence of software that can enable a robot to defend its clients from local killer fauna or a psychotic team member. The MurderBot universe of intelligence dispenses with normal side effects of intelligence, most notably an intelligent agent develops ethics, so that a human-level intelligent robot guard is fine with executing the entire team of scientists if they violate their contract. The one area where the book is scarily realistic is in the presence, and impact, of software bugs and software updates. Indeed, to a certain degree, the book is about bad software engineering. A bad software update leads to MurderBot acheiving political autonomy. Later, MurderBot has to defend its cadre of human client from other robots being hacked through vulnerabilities in software updates. The bad software engineering theme might seem forced but in real life it has become quite a topic in commercial robotics. For example, DJI, the largest manufacturer of small unmanned aerial vehicles, has pushed out several software updates that had serious bugs causing fly-aways and crashes. But onto to the questions that a sci-fi aficionado might have. Does this book provide a teachable moment about robots? Not really. Is it serious sci-fi literature up there with Arthur C. Clarke and Vernor Vinge? Definitely not. Is it worth reading? Heck yeah! All Systems Red will keep you laughing but also remind you to hesitate before applying that next update on your DJI drone. Otherwise you might hear it say in David Spade’s voice, “bub-bye now, ” as it flies off to get some Me Time.- Robin", "text": "Robotics Through Science Fiction\n20 reviews\n7 followers\nFollow\nMarch 6, 2018\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\nShow full review\nLike\nComment"}

In this society this type of AI is treated as a tool, either rented out on contract or sold outright, and nobody pauses to consider that they could be anything more than robots -- but Murderbot has hacked the \"governor module\" that is supposed to control its behavior, so unbeknownst to anyone it is actually autonomous. It is never made clear (at least in the first installment) just how much (if any) human brain input it actually has (it has a human-appearing head, but we don't know what's inside that head), but Murderbot clearly has emotions -- and social anxiety, which is by turns both funny and touching. Martha Wells is always good with characters, and this one is no exception -- she does a great job of showing instead of telling, and of letting the character grow.\n\nI also liked the plot. Murderbot has been rented out on contract to a planetary survey team, and on the new planet things gradually start to go mysteriously wrong. Everyone on the team, including Murderbot, will have to work together, get inventive, and stretch far beyond their comfort zones in order to figure out what's going on, and to survive until rescue can arrive. There's never a dull moment, and though at times the human characters seem too nice to be true, their interactions with Murderbot are great -- and I especially loved how Murderbot's reactions to them changed over time.\n\nThis novella has been getting a lot of Hugo buzz, and I can see why. I'm certainly going to put it on my nomination ballot. And even the Puppies, if they hadn't already run away from further attempts to manipulate Hugo results, couldn't have much objection to its tone -- sure, there are some Evil People at work, but over all it is really quite optimistic and uplifting in its outlook about both humans and AIs.\n\nIf you've enjoyed any of Wells's other books, read it. If you enjoy AI-more-human-than-you'd-think stories, read it. I'll certainly be reading the next installment.

There's never a dull moment, and though at times the human characters seem too nice to be true, their interactions with Murderbot are great -- and I especially loved how Murderbot's reactions to them changed over time.\n\nThis novella has been getting a lot of Hugo buzz, and I can see why. I'm certainly going to put it on my nomination ballot. And even the Puppies, if they hadn't already run away from further attempts to manipulate Hugo results, couldn't have much objection to its tone -- sure, there are some Evil People at work, but over all it is really quite optimistic and uplifting in its outlook about both humans and AIs.\n\nIf you've enjoyed any of Wells's other books, read it. If you enjoy AI-more-human-than-you'd-think stories, read it. I'll certainly be reading the next installment. I'm giving this about 4.4 stars and rounding down -- I might give it all 5 stars if we had more of the story instead of this being broken up into novella-sized pieces.\n\n\nscience-fiction\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

It is also weird that I relate so much to someone called Murderbot, but there is that.\n\nThis novella packs quite a punch for a short work: We are introduced to this modern universe, set sometime in the future where humans explore and live in many different planets and have also technologies to create part machine and part organic clone creatures who serve as guards for hire. Most of the world is a capitalist dystopia in which everything is controlled by The Company, including those guards, also called SecUnits. But our main character is a self aware SecUnit who calls itself (they don't have a gender) Murderbot, likes to watch tv shows (or serials) and would really prefer not to be bother by humanity, though they would do pretty much anything to protect their humans. Murderbot was set to protect these humans anyway, but since hacking its operational module, it doesn't have to.\n\nNeedless to say, I am Murderbot and Murderbot is me. Relating to the character was a great part of the enjoyment of this story. I liked how it has a theme of self discovery and independence of thought as well as friendships and how they can help us come into ourselves, but ultimately we must do our self assessments on our own.\n\nI do wish we had more world building and the plot itself wasn't that special or memorable, but I am curious to see where the story and Murderbot go next!\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\n\n\n\nadult\n \naudiobook\n \nread-march-2018\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

It barely does its job protecting humans on a little-known planet from large native fauna just so it can get back to its favorite show without suspicion or interference. When the surveyors it protects runs into problems, it is forced to interact with them, and it is SO AWKWARD and SO AMAZING. The robot calls itself \"murderbot\" and clearly has no idea how to interact socially, and in fact, really doesn't care enough to try.

A fast paced little book about a rogue Murderbot.\n\nThe plot of this novella was intriguing and solid enough. The world building and general left me wanting more. But really, it's Murderbot that sold it for me. I have to admit, it took me a couple of tries to get into the story in the beginning. But once I got a sense for Murderbot as a character I just fell in love. Murderbot is my Spirit Animal. Relatably snarky and pessimistic to the core. Loving books, movies and all things entertainment and just wanting to be left the fxck alone. The technology behind what makes up the physiology of theUnit is also very interesting and very sci-heavy.\nHow can I not squee in glee and laugh out loud when It does and reacts to things.\nSo although the story is really good. It's Murderbot that makes it just so much better. Hopefully everything will be fully explained in the other books. So glad there'll be more books in the series!\nLike\nComment"}

The idea has been done before and done better, but the tone of this book is unique. The same kind of unique which makes The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy’s robots unique… they have *some* feelings. That conceit makes this book an absolute joy to read. It not really about the action on screen, it’s more about the quiet moments in between. The interactions.\n\nAfter reading I Robot, I can sense that same freshness of thought. It shares a lot of DNA with a lot of stories from Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, but you can tell it’s written by a woman. It has more emotional depth than both those authors. It is also refreshing to read a story from a female perspective. Likewise violence always seems to shatter the moment. It’s not glorified, but rather something to push through and then recover from, rather than celebrate.\n\nThe book is short and I wish their was more of it to explore, but as there are more books in the pipeline, I can’t wait to rejoin our intrepid murderbot on her journey.\nLike\nComment"}

I'm glad I did.\nPlanet exploration is controlled now by the Company. Any exploratory team though must be accompanied by security units. Part flesh, mainly robotic, heavily armoured and armed, these units are designed to protect the explorers. And it help keeps the insurance rates down. Just to be on the safe side, all SecUnits are equipped with governor units to ensure that they obey, protect and serve.\nMeet Murderbot, a SecUnit that somehow has managed to bypass his governor unit, but is more interested in keeping up with his soap-operas than he is in virtually anything else.\nAs part of one of two teams exploring a new planet, this should be a fairly routine mission, however things start to take a weird turn, and with the sudden disappearance of the second group, he know has to try and protect his charges, and get them off planet before disaster hits them.\nI really rather enjoyed this, its past paced, proper thriller writing, but with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. There's a couple of deficiencies, strangely enough the Murderbot comes off as the most \"human\" of the characters, the team he's protecting just aren't particularly well characterised, which means you're looking for him to survive, the rest of them, not so much. He's got a lot of inner monologue, which comes across as particularly cynical and sharp, but it just makes him a more rounded character. For a bot designed to protect humans, he doesn't seem to like them much.\nThe ending is to me particularly disappointing, it doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book but saying that, this is supposed to be a 4 book series, which means it does set up the next book nicely. All in a strong start to a series I will be following.\n\ncrime\n \nfiction\n \nscience-fiction\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2018-03-19", "text": "Grace\n435 reviews\n16 followers\nFollow\nMarch 19, 2018\nThis review originally appeared on my blog, Books Without Any Pictures:\nhttp://bookswithoutanypictures.com/20...\n\nAll Systems Red is the first book in the series The Murderbot Diaries. And really, the word murderbot is what made me pick up this book. It just *sounds* like the kind of thing I’d want to read. Luckily, my instinct was correct, and All Systems Red did not disappoint.\n\nThe story is set in outer space. Space exploration is regulated by corporations, and those corporations are cheap and want to cut as many corners as possible so they can make lots and lots of money. When a group of explorers goes on a mission, the corporation makes them rent a SecUnit (security unit), an android made partially with cloned human parts, in order to protect (but mostly spy on and collect data from) the explorers.\n\nThe main character of this story is a SecUnit that’s hacked its governor module and gone rogue. It doesn’t want the humans to find out, because then it would be taken apart for scrap or would have another governor module installed, and that would mean the end of its freedom. Really, Murderbot (that’s what it calls itself in private) just wants to spend some quality time watching the many many many hours of soap operas that it downloaded. The thought of socializing with humans, who both fear and pity it, isn’t at all appealing.\n\nBut of course, life isn’t that easy. Someone is sabotaging the mission, and if the humans are going to survive, they’re going to have to work together with the newly rogue Murderbot to do so.\n\nI really liked the way that Murderbot is characterized throughout the story, because the author makes it very clear that even though Murderbot thinks like a person and has emotions, it isn’t a human at all. Murderbot has no gender, because it wasn’t built with any sexual parts or characteristics. It doesn’t hold grudges against the corporation or humans in general, because holding grudges is a very human thing to do. True, it has many human feelings and characteristics, but it’s also very much a robot. It doesn’t feel comfortable interacting with humans because humans either treat it with revulsion or try to humanize it, and the latter is extremely awkward for everyone involved precisely because it isn’t human. Murderbot is its own thing and doesn’t fit neatly into any of the boxes you try to put it in. It’s an alien consciousness that wasn’t supposed to happen, and now it’s trying to figure out its place in the world.\n\nI’m looking forward to the rest of this series. All Systems Red was a grand adventure, and I can’t wait to see what Murderbot will do with itself next.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

He truly doesn't want to be other than what he is and that is not a stand up comic or anything whatsoever that has to be of central focus or individual scrutiny.\n\nSo I thought the ending was superb.

Sharp, witty, a true SF novel in the way that it was written and the characterization of Murderbot. The best is when I was asked about the book by my wife, \"So, how's All Systems Red?\", and my reply was simply, \"Murderbot is trying to figure things out.\" The confused look was worth just that really lame exchange. I'm curious to see where this series goes... The loss of a star is due to the length. Normally I would say that 150 pages are just fine, but this could have used another 50 or so.

He is the product of a company which hires him out to protect interplanetary scientific and mining expeditions. He was fabricated using cheap materials and faulty software which failed on a previous assignment and sent him on a killing spree. Too expensive to be trashed, he was removed from service and updated with new software, which he has learnt to over-ride. His preference is to immerse himself in the entertainment data instead of his security detail which he completes in thorough albeit cursory manner.\nThe subsequent internal conflict between droid programming and the increasing empathy with his human charges is handled with humour albeit awkwardly. The faltering hesitant interaction between Muderbot and the crew he is assigned to protect develops as their lives are placed in danger. I was reminded of the similar conflicts experienced by Murphy played by Peter Weller in the movie Robocop #1 and Robert Mason's warrior droid in his novel \"Solo.\nShort punchy prose, equally brisk plot and minimalist character. Just the way I like my robots!\nLike\nComment"}

A robot trained to kill hostile fauna on alien planets while working alongside human exploration teams is the narrator. And what a character this robot, which calls itself a Murderbot, is.\n\nMurderbot hacks the governor module present in its system, essentially allowing it to decide whether to obey the commands sent by the clients who hired it, the choice which it would not have if the module had been operational.\n\nThe premise is utterly intriguing. And the first few lines of the book promise a great story and an entertaining tone for it. And the author delivers those promises.\n\n\nI COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\nSo this Murderbot uses all spare time it can get to watch sitcoms and entertainment content, despising human interaction and its job.\n\nI had thoroughly enjoyed reading this, not just because of the POV of the story or the tone of it, but also because of the story it had to offer. I was skeptical about the plot because how good would a plot be where the main character is a funny and brooding killing robot, but I was pleasantly surprised by how intense the story was. The action scenes and the suspense was so good, brief moments though they were. The plot gets a tad too contrived in the end for my liking, but this is a complaint I seem to be making for almost every book I read these days, so it wasn't that big a deal truly.\n\nI think people who are looking for something refreshing in terms of POV and story should read this, it's short and awesome.\nlesser-known-books\n \nsci-fi\n9 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Somehow, though, I rarely pick sci-fi books. Time to change it.\n\nAll Systems Red has an interesting premise - On a distant planet, a team of scientists is conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself as “Murderbot.”\n\nDespite this name, there's not much mayhem in the book. Actually, Murderbot is mostly interested in binge-watching shows on entertainment feeds. Fates of fictional characters are more important to it than the fates of scientist team she's supposed to protect.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems there's sort of a sabotage and lives are at stakes. Murderbot will have to make few important decisions.\n\nThe story is told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot. It seems people tend to enjoy her snarky narration. Personally, I couldn't connect to her / its voice. There's a serious lack of character and character development. The team of scientists is barely sketched, at times it's difficult to keep track of different characters as most of them have absolutely no personality.\n\n\n“Confession time: I don’t actually know where we are. We have, or are supposed to have, a complete satellite map of the planet in the survey package. That was how the humans decided where to do their assessments. I hadn’t looked at the maps yet and I’d barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we’d been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn’t had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn’t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don’t care.\n\n\nAs you see Murderbot doesn't care much about her team and isn't interested in nuances of their behavior. As a result, we don't learn about it. Think of them as chess pieces. Mostly pawns.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting novella but because I couldn't connect to Murderbot's voice, my enjoyment was limited.\nsci-fi\n14 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The start is captivating:\n\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\nMurderbot is a Security Unit (SecUnit) for a group of surveyors. Basically, it's a mix of organic and non-organic material that functions as a bodyguard. Murderbot is considered non-human (an AI?). The researchers nearly get killed, and discover that some group is out to kill them.\n\nIt's not a particularly original plot, but what makes it refreshing is the writing. I loved Murderbot - \nthere are several scenes where it makes expressions and regrets it - and so it prefers to hide behind the faceplate, it hates interacting with humans (it prefers to ride in the cargo compartment rather than with the humans), it loves watching entertainment, and somehow it also aims to help its humans. I also loved the scene where the humans realise that Murderbot has a hacked governor module - and spends that time watching entertainment. The ending was also great - it felt like a culmination of what Murderbot has been working up towards. It felt clear that \nthe humans felt something for Murderbot, considering their whispered conversations, but Murderbot didn't want anything to do with them. So it was great that Murderbot just seized its freedom and ran away. The last bits are particularly poignant too:\n\n\nI don't know what I want. I said that at some point, I think. But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.\n\nThat's why I left you, Dr. Mensah, my favourite human. By the time you get this I'll be leaving Corporation Rim. Out of inventory and out of sight.\n\nMurderbot end message.\n\n\n5/5\nfiction\n \nread-2018\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "read-2018", "text": "Maddalena\n400 reviews\n6 followers\nFollow\nApril 6, 2018\nMy only encounter so far with Martha Wells’ works has been through the first volume of her Tales of the Raksura series, an intriguing combination of fantasy and science fiction that somewhat defies genre definition, and one I intend to return to as soon as I can. I was therefore very curious to read this novella that promised to be quite different, since I enjoy seeing authors flex their proverbial writing muscles in different environments, and I can now say that All Systems Red was a very intriguing experience.\n\nOn the surface, this novella looks like the deceptively straightforward story of a scientific team exploring an alien world that finds itself threatened by what looks like incorrect information and equipment failure, which is later revealed as an attempt to kill them all to prevent discovery of an unlawful operation. The team is assisted, as required by the Company – the corporate entity supervising every planetary survey – by a SecUnit, an armed and armored android tasked with their protection. This particular SecUnit, though, is different from the other Company-supplied bots, because it’s been able to hack its own governor module, and therefore to act independently from any directive it receives.\n\nThis mutinous act from the SecUnit, that calls itself Murderbot because of a previous incident, is what defines the whole narrative, taking it away from any predictable path and moving it in unexpected – and sometimes deliciously funny – directions. The story is relayed by Murderbot itself, and as unreliable a narrator as it seems to be, the android speaks in a delightfully cynical voice that sets the tone from the very start, since the SecUnit did not hack its governor module for any dark purpose: all it wants is to be independent from the Company’s nagging presence, with its annoying updates and checks, and be free to enjoy the huge cache of serialized shows it downloaded for its own enjoyment.\n\nThis is a surprisingly human desire (how many times have we wished to spend a day lounging in front of the tv, instead of having to go to work?), and it sets from the start the parameters for the android’s personality, one that is revealed bit by bit during the course of the story and that manages to make Murderbot a very sympathetic character, one that’s quite easy to root for. If on one side Murderbot is not very fond of humans and tries to avoid their company as much as its duties allow, it does so because of its underlying inability to understand them fully, and in the end its fixation with the serials it’s so fond of might be a way to work toward that understanding through vicarious, less hands-on means. In a way I was reminded of a painfully shy adolescent trying to grasp the finer points of social intercourse by watching tv….\n\nWhat emerges from the fast-paced narrative is the progressive – and at times even unwilling – change in Murderbot’s psychological profile, which is not so surprising with some hindsight: a bot whose higher aspiration is to be free of superior directives so it can indulge in soap-opera binges is far too human to remain a detached machine for long. Not that our character does not try: we learn soon enough that it feels uncomfortable in the company of humans, that the necessity to lower its visor and show them its face makes it extremely nervous and exposed, which made me wonder how much aware Murderbot is of its difference from the basic SecUnit models, and convinced me of its partial unreliability as a narrator.\n\nAs the situation gets ever more dangerous for the science team, we see Murderbot change its attitude toward its humans – just as they change their own attitude toward it, accepting it as one of their own with surprising ease – so that it becomes not only their guard but their protector. The desire for freedom of choice, when paired with the need to safeguard the team’s lives (and incidentally its own), morphs into the first inklings of free will, that at first manifests itself in the ability of thinking up a scheme for the group’s survival and later becomes the desire/necessity to explore this amazing changes without further external influence.\n\nIt’s a fascinating journey from many points of view: because of the construct’s growing self-awareness, of course, but also thanks to Murderbot’s peculiar voice that is an irresistible mix of snark and logical thinking, of innocence (as far as interpersonal relations go) and craftiness. It was a delight following the unit’s journey, and I more than look forward to learning more in the upcoming novellas for this series, which I hope will also expand on the tantalizing details we just glimpsed about this future society.\n\n\nOriginally posted at SPACE and SORCERY BLOG\n\nread-2018\nLike\nComment"}

I managed to blow through it in a few hours, which is unusual for me. But the pace was so fast and the story so intriguing that I couldn't stop for long without wanting to get back in and find out what happened next.\n\nThe strength of this book is really Murderbot itself. The story is told from its perspective, and it's an interesting one.

But it has emotions and attachments, little quirks that make it evident that it's not just a robot.\n\nThe pace was so quick, and the story managed to pack a lot of action into relatively few pages.

There was so little detail about the planet, but didn't need it. You got just enough world building that everything made sense, but barely that and no more. Which I actually liked, for some reason. Crazy thing, the whole time, I pictured MurderBot as female. Yes, I know the book says it's gender neutral. But every scene, I pictured her female. When I looked to see how read the audiobook, it's a guy, and it made me think, did they ever say it looked more male or female? It didn't, but then why did I picture it so clearly as a female? No idea. I'm keeping my vision of her and can't wait to get to the next one!\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Feb. 2019 reread, just for fun! And to see if my rating would change now that I've read the full set of MURDERBOT DIARIES novellas (spoiler alert: it didn't, but I did enjoy this reread a little more than my initial read). All Systems Red won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novella, not to mention several other awards. There are (so far) three sequels and I loved them all! ... even more than this first book, truth be told, though maybe it just took me a while to really warm up to Murderbot. It's definitely a series that's worth reading, and this first book is just $3.99 for the Kindle version.\n\nReview posted on Fantasy Literature:\n\nThe narrator of All Systems Red is a once-nameless cyborg security unit or SecUnit that has given itself the name Murderbot (for reasons disclosed midway through the story). Using its own unprecedented and highly unauthorized initiative, Murderbot has hacked the governor module software that controls its actions and obligates it to be obedient. But instead of going on a killing spree, as one might expect given the name it adopted, Murderbot elects to spend its spare hours watching countless hours of video entertainment and trying not to interact more than is necessary with the group of eight humans that it’s responsible for protecting, a survey group of eight scientists called PreservationAux that is exploring the natural resources on an uninhabited planet.\n\nMurderbot’s self-isolation and studied lack of caring starts to break down, however, when potentially deadly accidents start to occur with suspicious regularity. Dr. Bharadwaj is almost killed by an alien creature that explodes out of the bottom of one of the many craters along the coast, and the group finds that data has been deleted from the warnings and fauna sections of their planetary survey package. The autopilot of their “hopper” aircraft cuts out without warning, which could have led to a fatal crash. And then there are the automated data updates that Murderbot is supposed to be uploading (and would have, if it hadn’t disabled its governor module).\n\nMatters only get worse when the group decides to visit the only other survey group on the planet. Murderbot is painfully shy and vastly reluctant to get too close to the humans, and even more, to share their secrets. But it becomes clear that the group won’t survive without Murderbot’s help and active involvement.\n\nAll Systems Red is a breezy, fast-paced science fiction adventure wrapped in a light mystery. There’s not nearly as much murder and mayhem as the title and Murderbot’s name might lead one to believe. Instead, All Systems Red has something serious to say about the ideas of free will and autonomy, and about the difficulties faced by introverts in day-to-day life. Murderbot tells itself that it just doesn’t care about the humans, but its excruciating shyness soon becomes clear to the other characters and to the reader. Murderbot hides its human face behind helmet with an opaque faceplate, and awkwardly withdraws from conversations that become too personal, choosing to stand facing the wall instead.\n\nMurderbot comments that it has no gender or sex-related parts; claiming that only sexbots in brothels have those. Understandably, it has an asexual personality, another unique aspect to this main character. Murderbot fast-forwards through all of the sex scenes in the serials it watches, finding them boring (“I think that even if I did have sex-related parts I would find them boring”). Murderbot also narrates this novella with a large dose of snark:\nThey had talked it over and all agreed not to “push me any further than I wanted to go” and they were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. I can’t do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans. … At least Mensah and Arada had overruled the ones who wanted to talk to me about it. Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful that I dropped to 97% efficiency.\nMurderbot is a unique, well-developed character but, other than the leader of the survey group, Dr. Mensah, and one other person who is somewhat antagonistic to Murderbot, the members of PreservationAux aren’t particularly distinguishable personalities. We learn that Overse and Arada are in a lesbian relationship and that Volescu is in a four way marriage back on their home planet, but Wells never really attempts to make them or any of the others fully fleshed-out characters. It’s possible that that is a deliberate approach, a feature rather than a flaw, meant to evidence Murderbot’s unwillingness to engage with members of the group on a personal level.\n\nAll Systems Red is an enjoyable, quick read, and a good introduction to the new MURDERBOT DIARIES series. It’s a credit to Wells that the last chapter is such a solid conclusion to the story. I appreciated how Murderbot’s increased confidence is reflected in its ability to show its human face in public. It’s strong enough that it could have been a stand-alone novella, even though the ending leaves the door wide open for Murderbot’s further adventures. The following three novellas are really great, and I strongly recommend not stopping with this one!\n\nContent note: violence and a couple of F-bombs.", "text": "Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽\n1,880 reviews\n23.3k followers\nFollow\nFebruary 11, 2019\nFeb. 2019 reread, just for fun!

The charm of Murderbot is that it genuinely gives the bare minimum of fucks, wanting nothing except to be left alone to binge-watch space-adventure serials. It also finds interacting with humans to be mortifying, as bad as being the only teenager in a roomful of adults. Even the fact that it has some organic parts -- never explained, but I assumed vat-grown -- is something it steadfastly refuses to dwell on. But suddenly Murderbot becomes the unlikely hero in its own space adventure serial! Its latest clients are targeted for murder, and only our intrepid SecUnit can get them to safety.\n\nLike many others I have swiftly succumbed to the awkward charms of Murderbot. I enjoyed the subtle world-building, difficult in a novella, particularly the spectrum of man-machine hybrids. I thought there were a few more characters than strictly necessary, but that's a minor nit. The surprise twist ending made me happy.\nLike\nComment"}

Altogether, this novella took me about three hours. I disliked most of that experience.\n\nSecBot (which has privately named itself MurderBot), is a cyborg that is contracted to provide security to a team of humans (including one \"augmented\" human) surveying a planet for an evil corporation whose only characteristic seems to be criminally tight purse strings. The team is being chased by another shadowy group. MurderBot has a past it's ashamed of. It spends its alone time feeding its media addiction. It speaks and thinks wryly and sarcastically, and in a strangely anachronistic manner. It does its best to hide from the others on the team, which the author reminds us on nearly every page.\n\nMurderBot is irritating. The human members of the expedition are indistinguishable from each other, save for the leader, who most willingly sees the humanity in MurderBot.\n\nThis story may be an allegory for slavery. It definitely is oddly cobbled together with scraps from other sci-fi stories. By the end, I just didn't care for any of it.\n4 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "The introduction to The Murderbot Diaries is simply great fun! A refreshing and diverting sci-fi novella with wide appeal; a marvellous package of wry humour, suspense and a healthy dose of compassion.\n\nAs much as I love science fiction, I don't consider myself as a hardcore reader of the genre, and there are a lot of popular series or \"required reading\" which I have yet to catch-up on. In this respect, I find this book to be original; it is not a space opera, cyberpunk and it is not about an alien invasion. This is a first-person perspective narrative of a humanlike bot, a construct of both organic and inorganic parts, who finds it/him/herself becoming weird and messed up with increasing ‘emotions' while dealing with her human clients even though the bots are not programmed as such. (Okay, I am going to call the bot a ‘her' because even though it is technically genderless, I can't help picturing it as a female. The voice of her first-person perspective just sounds feminine, in my opinion).\n\nCheck out its hook right at the beginning.\n\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment feed carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\nNow, tell me that you don't want to keep on reading after that! The Murderbot (a self-proclaimed name) is an introverted, socially awkward/anxious ‘geek' who couldn't wait to get back to her serials once her job is done instead of hanging around with her human clients to whom she was contracted to as the SecUnit. In corporate-dominated space travel, this was the order of the day for all entities who want to conduct explorations or surveys on various planets. One SecUnit for every ten humans for security reasons, the contractee will also be using the company's habitats, database and communications systems, and an emergency beacon. As the contracts are, strangely, won by the lowest bidder, the company is cheap and we get a lot of humourous narrative about the deplorable quality and condition of the company's software and hardware from the Murderbot's point-of-view.\n\nEven as a construct, the Murderbot is completely relatable and endearing, especially the way she keeps wanting to go back to her serials or trying to sneak in some time to watch her entertainment feeds. There are too many times when I feel a desperate need to be left alone to my books; a feeling I am sure every avid reader out there shares one way or another. While I can't call myself a social misfit, this is something I empathise with, where any form of interaction can be absolutely frightening, particularly when it involves eye contact and physical touch. The underlying message of the story goes down deeper into the theme of slavery and social outcasts, which these bots essentially are in respect to the humans.\n\nThe story is most compelling and amusing when she finds herself feeling out of sorts with her current client, a bunch of scientists and explorers whom she found herself liking, and much to her chagrin were intent on treating her as one of them. Her observation of this group was a hilarious analogy to her serials.\n\n\nThe whole group had been remarkably drama-free so far, which I appreciated. The last few contracts had been like being an involuntary bystander in one of the entertainment feed's multi-partner relationship serials except I'd hated the whole cast.\n\nThere are plenty more of such amusing asides as she and her clients found themselves in a life or death situation. As a rogue SecUnit with a hacked governor module who liked her clients enough not to see them killed, she endeavoured to save them from whatever or whoever is trying to hunt them down. There are great moments of suspense from this arc, although I did find its ending to be quite abrupt.\n\nWith its crisp and captivating delivery in a morsel-sized story, I am looking forward to more adventures with the Murderbot.\n\nYou can order this book from: Amazon US | Amazon UK | Book Depository (Free shipping worldwide)\n\nYou can also find this, and my other reviews at Novel Notions.", "text": "TS Chan\n817 reviews\n951 followers\nFollow\nMarch 20, 2019\nThe introduction to The Murderbot Diaries is simply great fun!

The main character is the eponymous Murderbot, a security robot who has become self-aware. Unlike most “self-aware AI tries to start a life” stories, all Murderbot wants is to be left alone to watch his soap operas. He spends every minute trying to avoid being discovered, and when he gets sucked into a proper action-movie conspiracy, he spends the entire time complaining about how dumb humans are and waiting for it to end so he can get back to his stories.

All I knew was that it was about an artificial intelligence or robot called \"Murderbot.\"\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that it is a VERY short book and so it is a very quick read. The basic set up is that the story is told in the first person in the voice of the Murderbot, who is a cyborg (s/he has organic parts but also machinery intertwined in its body, including built in guns in its arms!).\n\nWe begin the book in media res, with the Murderbot watching over its human \"clients\" on a uninhabited planet when suddenly an attack occurs by one of the more violent alien fauna. It's basically non-stop action from then on. The voice of Murderbot is somewhat snarky and there is some interesting description(s) and presentation(s) of the cultural position of cyborgs in society.\n\nOverall, I was unimpressed with All Systems Red. Although the premise is somewhat interesting, I just didn't engage strongly with the main character. I didn't really care that much about what happens to Murderbot at the end of the story, primarily because Murderbot is somewhat cavalier towards its own ongoing existence. If Murderbot doesn't really care if it lives or dies then why should we?\n2018-read\n10 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I really enjoy their newsletters. If you don't subscribe, you should.\n\nSo, back in the day, Knights of the Old Republic was one of my favorite video games (still is, actually). One of the things I most enjoyed about it was a little character called HK-47, a murderous droid who whined whenever my light-side Jedi character wouldn't allow him to go on a killing rampage. He had some seriously great lines that added a lot of levity to the storyline, so when I read the premise of this novella, I was all in.\n\nNow, Murderbot is not HK-47. Actually, in a lot of ways, Murderbot is the anti-HK-47 because Murderbot doesn't want to murder anyone. Mostly, what Murderbot wants is to be left alone to watch sci fi and adventure vids. Murderbot's current assignment should be the perfect opportunity for this, but things go south very quickly, which means poor Murderbot has to interact with humans. The horror!\n\nI so enjoyed this novella because, while it's a fun romp, I was very impressed with how well-done Murderbot is. I'd dare to say plenty of introverts can relate to Murderbot's predicaments. I also just plain loved Murderbot's voice, which was so much fun. There's still some serious stuff in here, lots of action and peril, yet it also maintains a more lighthearted tone that makes it a lot of fun to read. I don't mind very serious subjects, mind you, but it is nice to read something that's more fun, and I thought this novella had the right combination of substance and charm, along with an excellent sense of humor. I very much look forward to reading more about Murderbot!\n2018\n \nsci-fi-and-fantasy\n \nshort-fiction\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

I can't tell if I liked it or not - the narrator sounded pretty glib for an amalgam of biological and machine intelligence, enslaved to a life of violent labor - but I strongly empathized with his reactions to dealing with people, and was pretty bummed out when the book ended and am probably going to binge as much of this as I can, so I'm gonna give this four stars and get the rest.\nLike\nComment"}

NEVER!!!)\n395 reviews\n185 followers\nFollow\nApril 19, 2018\nThe Murderbot Diaries and The Princess Diaries are different books, capiche?\n\n\n\n\nSoooo, you meet this Murderbot who likes TV shows. She is a bit like Glados from Portal (sister from another mister, I assume). Her lifes were pretty miserable, so she learned to hack a bit. And now she is on a mission with some humans. And she doesn't care about most of the stuff. Living la vida loca in some distant planet, chilling with TV shows. But as we know, stuff happens. And the shit storm comes.\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that didn't work with me was style. I think this book would have worked better as a book, not a novella. The length worked against the author, since I would have loved deeper background exploration, more character revelation. Now everything was skipped past in a speed of light, making everybody boring or chaotic. I think the goal of this book was to introduce Murderbot, and I think it failed a little. I had very little idea who she was and why she behaved in the ways she behaved - and I had very little understanding of what made her unique as a bot. I also would have loved to know more about crew - not it was just The Lady Boss and The Grumpy Guy. Also, the conflict was too shallow to really wow the reader as novellas have a very short time to make the impact and they have to make it big.

Murderbot is on loan from a company to protect a survey/research sort of team out on mission, of course some stuff goes down during the mission, surprise. I wound up not caring all that much about the plot, at times I wanted to solve the who and the why, but for the most part I was more engaged in the internal voice of Murderbot, along with the crew interactions/reactions. The world also seemed interesting, particularly the place the crew they are with came from, but is kept pretty minimal and bare bones to focus on Murderbot's head.\ntor-ebook-club\n4 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The reader is slammed into the story with the force of an asteroid hitting a moon: you're expected to keep up and learn on the fly, and just deal with it. The only problem I have with this approach is the unrequited desire it leaves behind. The characters manage to be sympathetic and fascinating...but I started to want more. More background to this world, more set up for all of the characters...more, more, more. I wanted another 100 pages to flesh out this world and its people...but this is a roller coaster traveling at warp speed, with no time for contemplative back story. In spite of my caveats, I think I'm interested enough to pick up the next volume and follow the journey of the SecUnit striking out on its own...\nother-sf-fantasy\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot (self-nicknamed) is a construct made up of organic and robotic parts. It’s working as a security unit for a bunch of explorers/surveyors on a previously unexplored planet. It has hacked its governor module so it couldn’t be compelled to follow orders, and so it could download and binge-watch video dramas. It also has severe social anxiety and prefers to hide behind an opaque helmet rather than letting the humans see its ‘face’. When the only other group on the planet is murdered off by an unknown third entity, Murderbot takes responsibility for the human team and tries to keep them alive. There was a lot in the way of characterization and themes packed into this small novella. Can’t wait to read more in this series.\nfantasy-sci-fi\n \nfavorites\n \nfirst-of-a-series\nLike\nComment"}

It was nice to listen to something so short, and I was glad this was casual over heavy sci-fi.\n\nNarration\n\nI liked the narration, it was clear and embodied the POV characters inner monologue well.\nThe only thing I would comment on is the choice of a male narrator, but as far as I can remember, the Murderbot is not given a specified gender (it's told from it's perspective), so I think if I'd read it instead of listened to it, the main character would've been more ambiguous, but giving it such a masculine voice makes our gendered brains slot it into a \"man\" automatically unless we (or I) actually thought about it. However, with an audiobook, this is hard to avoid.\n\nCharacter\n\nThe fact I read this on audio, and because this is so short, I found I thought of the main group of humans as a collective group over any one person, but I liked them, and if they return in later novels I would like for them to become more distinct. (though I did get a gist of more characters from Every Heart a Doorway on audio and that novel is around the same length).\n\nThe POV character, Murderbot, was great. It was really fun to read about. I loved the idea of a \"murderbot\" who just wants to watch serial TV dramas. Its feelings about humans, and the distinction between it and them was well done, and it really made this book for me into something special.\n\nPlot\n\nI'm not going to lie, I only had half an idea of what was happening with the plot.\nThe plot wasn't the most important thing about this book, for me, but it was interesting enough, but it was more his inner feelings and his development of trust of the people around him who caught my attention personally- but there's enough action to keep less character-based readers interested.\nI will say, I really liked how it ended, and I am interested in the next in the series if I can find it for a good price at some point.\n\n\nOverall\n\nThis was a fun sci-fi novel with good characters and humorous main first person perspective.\nLike\nComment"}

I give you; Murderbot. Accidently too clever for its own programming, our new robot buddy has hacked its own systems and can't be controlled via remote commands anymore. On the plus side, his gives it more time to watch its soaps. This could be a bad thing, but maybe a good thing if your Murderbot actually takes a liking to you and thinks choosing to protect you is a good idea. Or, you know, it could change its mind and murder you in your sleep.\n\nLike our Terminator friends, Murderbot is a fun-filled mash-up of organic and robotic parts, but the internal monologue sounds pretty darn human-like to me. Of course, this raises the concepts of slavery, murder and the free will of constructs, so of course, it depends where in the universe you were raised as to whether you accept this intelligent underclass as humanities tools or independent sentient beings.\n\nAlso, the whole capitalism and just-in-time, as-crap-as-they-can-get-away-with software, services and insurance policies of 'the company' crack me up. As someone who works in software development, there is no way I'd be cool with remote upgrades to my Murderbot, let me tell you.\n2018-hugo-finalists\n \nbought\n \nfive-star\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

He's currently leased out to a survey team on an unsettled planet. It's a small survey team, and he's the only security unit.\n\nWhat neither the clients nor the company know is that he has hacked his governor module, and obeying orders is a choice for him.\n\nThat will turn out to be a good thing for everyone.\n\nThere's another survey team on the planet, a larger one, on the other side of the planet. They can communicate but don't have a lot of reason to do so. There's also a third group, that they don't know about, and which has nefarious intentions, for something valuable on the planet, and for the survey teams that could frustrate their plans.\n\nMurderbot is likable, surprised to find that he cares what happens to his clients, and despite crappy education modules, has learned a lot from his voracious consumption of entertainment videos.\n\nAt only a bit over three hours, it's short, lively, and enjoyable.\n\nRecommended.\n\nI bought this audiobook.\naudiobooks\n \nf-sf\n \nfiction\n5 likes\nLike\nComment"}

But despite Murderbot's name for itself, it's actually a rather hilarious & relatable individual.\n\nBeing deeply invested in downloaded media & characterized by it's inability to interact with humans without being awkward, I feel as though Murderbot will connect with many readers on a personal level.\n\nThe short arc of this story is entertaining to say the least & even manages to pack in some heavy themes about autonomy & friendship (HELLO THIS IS WHAT I WANTED BUT DID NOT GET FROM AUTONOMOUS!)\n\nIt really appeals to my desire for Science Fiction that doesn't require hundreds of pages & convoluted paragraphs to make its point.

In its short reading time, the book efficiently sets up a corporate space setting and a mystery. The story itself never quite feels consequential. The main focus, instead, is on the development of Murderbot as they decide what they want for themselves out of life. Like Becky Chambers' A Closed And Common Orbit, there is a refreshing focus not on the central android character wanting to be human, but instead having their own (synthetic) identity and growing within that, damn the expectations of others. The book is empathetic, but also very very funny. Will happily read more tales of Murderbot going forward.\nscience-fiction\n \nyay-spaceships\nLike\nComment"}

More than a few people I know claim that the MurderBot series are the best things she's ever written. That's high praise indeed, when you consider Martha Wells' output.\n\nI have little to be critical of in this tale, except to say that whatever other folks saw in this book, I did not. It dragged and meandered. While I appreciated some of the jokes regarding MurderBot's utter disdain for the humans be works with, it got tiresome quickly. I never could come to like it as a protagonist. It was snarky and superior to the point of being unsympathetic. Neither did I develop a fondness for the people in the unit which MurderBot worked with. So, I was left with a stage set with no one I cared about, all engaging in life or death struggles meant to keep me on the edge of my seat. But the edge was never as comfortable as leaning back, flipping another page, and waiting for the book to end so I could get on to something I enjoyed more. By the end, I was reading All Systems Red a little like MurderBot looked at the humans around him - with disdain and a desire to watch soap operas instead.\n2018\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

While these ethical issues are apparent given the subject matter and first-person perspective, they are merely brushed against, and are in no way a focus of the plot. If that's what you're looking for, I suggest checking out some Isaac Asimov. Having said that, All Systems Red is excellent. The plot moves along nicely with a good balance of mystery, action, and social anxiety. The humor is more subtle than laugh out loud, but serves to really make Murderbot (who just wants to be left alone to binge watch TV shows) a very relatable character.\n\nAs long as you're not looking for a deep philosophical treatise, All Systems Red is a great sci-fi read, and one I'd easily recommend.\n2018\nLike\nComment"}

I felt that it was over-hyped and it could've been better. I felt that the writing was clunky and amateur. Surprising, since I believe that I heard that this author has written many books and this was her first novella. The world-building and the characters were weak. I felt like I wasn't fully invested in any of the characters and I didn't care much about their interactions. The plot was interesting but it took until about page 50 for it actually pick up. The dialogue felt as though it slowed down the plot and mystery. Eventually once it picked up, I found myself compelled to finish. The ending was lacking and unsatisfactory. I see the reason why the author decided to end it the way she did for Murderbot's sake. So why did I give it three stars? It was the plot. I thought it was pretty good. This book mostly suffered from weak characters, stilted protagonist and bland world-building. I felt like the mystery was the best part hence the rating.\n\nI may pick up the next novella but I probably won't rush out and purchase it. I would only pick up this novel if you're new to sci-fi, you care more about a plot versus characters, and you don't have much time on your hands but you want to read something about AI. I am definitely open to picking more Martha Wells if someone can tell me if her books are better.\n2018\n \nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

I was swept up by the idiosyncratic voice of our host, Murderbot, a machine rented to destroy your enemies, or just to protect you. Murderbot is understandably socially awkward, preferring to watch TV than actually talk to people, and when overstimulated, the poor thing may just walk into a corner to calm down. Wells has captured an adorable awkwardness that is the perfect lens for a scientific adventure out in space.\n\nThe actual story is fairly simple, with the wrinkle that Murderbot's current crew of humans are scientists who are actually curious how it works. There's bickering, backbiting, and attempts to sneak a killer module into the machine's workings. The whole thing is breezily resolvable once everyone on the mission to be honest with what they've been keeping from each other.\n\nYou're here for the crew, and you're really here to hear Murderbot's quirky take on the crew and their plight. The real meat is seeing Murderbot stretch their skills, and finding the strength to choose to socialize. From there, they have the opportunity to grow into a person who might escape their existence as a rented weapon of destruction, and venture out into the cosmos in search of a better life and home.\n\nThe strongest part of the story is the last quarter, where Murderbot is most willing to gamble their freedom to help the humans who've cared for it, and the potential of them reciprocating. The warmth of acceptance here is one of the fondest experiences I've had reading a book in months. It promises even richer stories as the series progresses.\n4 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe main character is a security android, or SecUnit, who is in charge of protecting a team of scientists exploring an alien planet. The SecUnit has hacked his own governor and is more human and self-aware than a SecUnit should be, and has to hide this from his human team. While he is all business in the field, off duty he is socially uncomfortable and goes off by himself to watch movies and his favorite TV series rather than spending time with the humans. In his head he jokingly refers to himself as \"Murderbot\". After an introduction to Muderbot, the team, and mission, a crisis develops on the planet and and the plot starts to kick in to gear.\n\nDespite the fact that Murderbot is designed to kill, he is a very likable and relatable character. And despite the length of the novella the other characters are really well fleshed out and the story is interesting and engaging. The narration was really good, capturing the shyness and social awkwardness of the Murderbot along with the \"killing is my business\" side of his personality.\n\nI'm looking forward to checking out the next installment in Martha Wells' The Murderbot Diaries.\n2018-read\n \naudio\n \nhugo-award\n \n...more\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Going back and rereading it two years later, I realised the book does have some big flaws. The worldbuilding feels perfunctory at best, generic at worst. The characters surrounding Murderbot feel indistinguishable. The plot is short, but recognisable - a flaw more of the length of the book than the skill of the writer.\n\nHowever, flaws fade in comparison to the big personality of Murderbot itself, and I will find myself going through the whole series very quickly for them.\nLike\nComment"}

Down the road we’ll learn more I guess.\n\nWhy 3 Stars ?

I'm glad I managed to get past the name, though, because beneath that corniness is a story that actually really worked for me. Following the internal monologue of the self-proclaimed Murderbot, All Systems Red tells a story of social anxiety and learning how to function in a world where you feel like an outsider. It's a really great read, and the internal deliberations of the Murderbot are the highlight here, but even that's supported extremely well with an intriguing sci-fi mystery plot.\n\nThe survey team who employ the SecUnit are all interesting characters in their own right, even if they weren't given much time to grow and develop. I liked them and I hope they show up again in later installments in this series. As for the story, it's nothing new and was pretty predictable, but it has plenty of mysterious data breaches and questionable corporate motivations to interest most sci-fi fans.\n\nAll Systems Red is a short read, clocking in at about 150 pages, so you'll likely be able to finish it up in about a day. That, coupled with the likable characters and solid enough plot, will make this a go-to book recc for me. If you've been on the fence about this one, I definitely recommend you check it out.\nfemale-protag\n \ngenre-sci-fi\n \nowned-physical\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "A security cyborg hacks its governor module, and self-describes as Murderbot, but on the whole can't be arsed to go on killing rampages, which after all are a very short-term release valve before you get recycled for parts. So mainly it just keeps quiet, tries to avoid awkward interaction with human colleagues, and uses its illicit freedom chiefly to goof off and quietly watch the entertainment feeds (because having emotions about reality is hard, but having them about TV is fun). And that deeply relatable protagonist, its laconic narration and resigned heroism, is the main attraction here. Despite its lack of junk (it's not a sexbot, after all), I was reminded at times of Flashman, especially in the later books, where Harry remains a bastard but not half so much of a bastard as he likes to claim, and if he frequently does the right thing simply because being revealed as a coward would be so embarrassing, well, isn't that often the way?\n\nThe plot is fairly standard stuff - Murderbot is accompanying a survey team who are exploring a new world, and they've been obliged to buy equipment from an evil monopoly corporation, and the equipment is fairly shit but increasingly seems to be not just sub-par, but actively sabotaged, and yeah, none of that is remotely new. But in this short a novel, I didn't mind, because Murderbot itself is sufficiently entertaining company easily to carry the hour or two we spend seeing the world through its eyes.\n(Interestingly, I've read at least one review where the reviewer couldn't bear to call Murderbot 'it', even though that seems to be Murderbot's preferred pronoun, and the reviewer acknowledged how that should normally decide the matter for everyone. There's a lot to be said for Granny Weatherwax's line that all the worst crimes begin with thinking of people as things.

So mainly it just keeps quiet, tries to avoid awkward interaction with human colleagues, and uses its illicit freedom chiefly to goof off and quietly watch the entertainment feeds (because having emotions about reality is hard, but having them about TV is fun). And that deeply relatable protagonist, its laconic narration and resigned heroism, is the main attraction here. Despite its lack of junk (it's not a sexbot, after all), I was reminded at times of Flashman, especially in the later books, where Harry remains a bastard but not half so much of a bastard as he likes to claim, and if he frequently does the right thing simply because being revealed as a coward would be so embarrassing, well, isn't that often the way?\n\nThe plot is fairly standard stuff - Murderbot is accompanying a survey team who are exploring a new world, and they've been obliged to buy equipment from an evil monopoly corporation, and the equipment is fairly shit but increasingly seems to be not just sub-par, but actively sabotaged, and yeah, none of that is remotely new. But in this short a novel, I didn't mind, because Murderbot itself is sufficiently entertaining company easily to carry the hour or two we spend seeing the world through its eyes.\n(Interestingly, I've read at least one review where the reviewer couldn't bear to call Murderbot 'it', even though that seems to be Murderbot's preferred pronoun, and the reviewer acknowledged how that should normally decide the matter for everyone. There's a lot to be said for Granny Weatherwax's line that all the worst crimes begin with thinking of people as things. But like any moral injunction, it should always be tempered with George Bernard Shaw's observation 'Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.'

I think that my favorite aspect of the Murderbot Diaries is that Eden could totally kill all humans, but, like, meh. In a world of highly skilled humans, we often end up doing only what is required in our job because there’s no incentive (other than losing our job) to do more. Oh how I relate to Eden and ter loathing of humanity. How many times have I been at work, and wished that I were Netflixing or reading a book instead.\n\nIn All Systems Red, we get the backstory of Eden and ter sordid past as an ineffectual murderbot. Te really does care about the humans that te is expected to protect. Te doesn’t have to protect them, because of the hacked governor, but te does it out of a sense of professional responsibility.\n\nI enjoyed All Systems Red, and look forward to reading more offerings by Martha Wells, especially more Murderbot Diaries.

I do love Murderbot, and the little glimpses of their humor we get to see. They definitely read autistic to me, and I just want to wrap them in a cozy blanket and let them watch TV and make everything okay. (As someone who's had her life decided for her, I thought the ending was perfectly executed.)\n\nBut their humor is sporadic and the prose is often dry and \"tells\" rather than \"shows.\" (I usually hate that rule because it can be broken amazingly well, but this is not one of those times.)\n\nAnd there are times when the prose seems to slip into present tense and others where they really need a comma or two to clear up sentences that are long but they don't have commas making me very irritated.\n\nThe human characters all felt the same to me. Like, I'm reasonably sure Gurathin is a jerk and Rathi likes Murderbot, but I couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of them. I'm not even sure of their genders half the time because they're all so forgettable. Part of that is my personal dislike for books that only give characters last names, but I feel it's also the characterization.\n\nThat's not to say it was a bad book.

It's the tale of a security clone-android hybrid that has managed to disable its obedience protocols after a job gone wrong meant it killed the humans it was supposed to protect. Determined not to let that happen again, now the entity that has dubbed itself \"murderbot\" is trying to hide from its latest set of human clients and its corporate masters that its obedience programming is offline so it won't get decommissioned and recycled for parts. It has also discovered a love for soap operas. But when the current exploratory mission goes south, murderbot's unique ability to ignore orders may be the only thing that stands between the group and total annihilation.\nI loved the cartoon show The Zeta Project (a spinoff of futuristic Batman Beyond) when I was in high school, about a government assassin robot that discovered a target was innocent and had an existential crisis as a result, overrode its programming and went on the run.

{"username": "", "date": "Rating 4 stars. Doing a reread of the series. This first novella really seems a vehicle to introduce us to the unique Murderbot and give us a feel for it's role. The main character has a unique voice and great asides, delivered in a straightforward manner, giving this introduction a dry sense of humor.\nMurderbot, who is part organic material (human cloning) and part machinery, was designed to protect humans in hostile conditions (or attack enemies). In the past, we come to learn, its governor module went haywire and Murderbot killed 57 members of a mining operation. Murderbot, so horrified by this, figured out how to deactivate the governor module so functions using it's own free will. Murderbot is loyal, observant, anxious, and socially awkward. It seems it has more negative emotions than positive, but its logical side keeps it functioning pretty well. When Murderbot becomes anxious, it removes itself from humans and retreats into media downloads (of old serial shows, like Sanctuary Moon) to decompress.\nThe basic plot of this novella is Murderbot works for a scientist/ survey team who are studying an uninhabited planet. The team, PreservationAux includes leader Dr, Mensah, Pin-Lee, Overse, Arada, Ratthi, Volescu, and augmented human Dr. Gurathin. When the team learns Murderbot functions independently, they are worried. But Dr. Mensah, optimistically, gives Murderbot a chance. Then they discover that someone is messing with their satellite link, giving them inaccurate information. Another group of scientists, on the other side of the planet, Deltfall, stops communicating so the Preservation group decides to investigate.\nThey travel together and discover all the humans in the other group have been killed. The other secUnits (like Murderbot) have been altered to attack instead of protect. Dr. Mensah is asked to negotiate with the rogue humans who have taken over. Murderbot devises a plan to trick them. Afterwards, the human team members are grateful; Dr. Mensah buys Murderbot's contract. \nMurderbot, out of anxiety, decides to run away..\nThe matter of fact dialogue is entertaining. And Murderbot's primary function contrasted with its anxiety is a humorous mix. I can see it would have wide appeal because of the story being succinct and Murderbot capturing a common brand of anxiety in modern life. (July 24, 2025)\n\nRating 3 stars. This author does a nice job of taking a heavily used plot and adding in a couple twists. The book reads easily and smoothly because the writing is clear and interesting. The characters are interesting as well. The main character, the Murderbot, is actually a shy, tenderhearted security guard who clearly needs a fuller life. Several other characters are complex enough the story feels more full.\nI really liked the main character because she is skilled, clever, and needy. The combination makes for an interesting read despite the flaws: The plot is very familiar with a very predictable ending.

We've all been there.\n\nLoved this novella, the droll sense of humor perfectly portrays Murderbot's apathy - not because it has non-organic parts, but because it just can't be bothered to care. It's delightfully frank about the difference between SecUnit bodies and human bodies, with musings on how the humans would probably be alarmed if Murderbot's body parts just starting falling to the floor, but it's not a big deal for a SecUnit.

Here was this genderless entity that felt uncomfortable around humans and would hide in literal armor so that they wouldn’t be able to read its emotions. The reason it felt compelled to protect the humans was because that was its job and it didn’t know what else to do. It often felt bored and apathetic, but in the end it did the right thing. And what I liked about this decision to save the humans wasn’t that they won him over or that buried inside this robot exterior was really a heart of gold, but it was just because that was what it wanted to do at that moment. In the end when the humans buy Murderbot’s freedom and give it the option to work on a farm and learn an occupation, it decides instead to run away. “I don’t know what I want.… I don’t want to anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.” And that is what true autonomy is: the freedom to fuck up and make bad or selfish choices.\n5\nLike\nComment"}

The book was a collection of stories that explored humankind’s future with robots. The key robot was R. Daneel Olivaw.\n\nYou may recall the three laws of Robotics:\n1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nThat only works if your robot’s implant hasn’t been hacked. Wells’ robot is good at hacking and has a few deaths in its past. It refers to itself as “Murderbot” but doesn’t share this with the group of humans who it is now responsible for. It is a far cry from R. Daneel Olivaw, but that's part of what makes this \"diary\" so interesting.\n\nOur team is on an unexplored planet trying to get to know the geology, geography, flora and fauna. Right off the bat, one of the “fauna” almost kills a member of the crew and our ‘bot barely saves him. The crew is appreciative but all our ‘bot wants to do is be left alone so it can hack into its favorite library of “soap operas.” This has some effect on team dynamics: “Now they knew their murderbot didn’t want to be around them any more than they wanted to be around it. I’d given a tiny piece of myself away. That can’t happen. I have too much to hide, and letting one piece go means the rest isn’t as protected.”\n\nWells does a brilliant job of giving us the ‘bot’s perspective and this novella is the start of the series. She shows her usual deft touch with plot and characterization. It will be hard to resist jumping into the next one; particularly with such encouragement from GR friend Carol.\n39 likes\n7 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The specific thing that made me melt is that he was cold and had to wrap himself up in a blankie, and the contrast between a cold, robotic killing machine that you expect, and the actual living being that has feelings and likes to be warm and comfy almost made me lose my mind out of immediate and intense affection for the lonely little guy.

Very fascinating premise (of a security unit [part robotic, part biological] who has hacked his own governor unit and has acquired a 'free will' of sorts), but what I love the most is that the story is more about a less important individual. Yes, he plays a significant role in helping a small group survive, but they're not saving a planet or the galaxy - just surveying a planet.\n\nWells has imbued a fun, dryly sarcastic tone to Murderbot's narration (yes, the sec unity calls himself Murderbot, but he'd rather watch entertainment serials than bother with anything else). There are some interesting philosophical, technological and sociological questions being toyed with throughout the story, which I think lends it an unexpected depth. And Wells doesn't really try to answer questions of free will, personhood, the addictive nature of entertainment (and its impact upon one's relationship with others), or even corporate negligence and bureaucratic impotence. She just lets them unfold in the story and the reader can catch glimpses of them if he or she keeps an eye open for it.\n\nPhilosophical musings aside, the story is fun and moves at a nice clip. This is the first book in a series, but it also stands on its own pretty nicely.\nscience-fiction\nLike\nComment"}

Until things go very very wrong.\n\nThe story is told from 1st person pov of Murderbot, who refers to itself as it. It hacked its governor control, so it has a free will and it chooses to spend its free time reading books and watch tv serials. Has there ever been more relatable bot? Murderbot is cranky, pessimistic and it has the whole \"leave-me-alone-you-weird-humans-I-want-to-watch-shows-in-peace\" attitude. It doesn't have any gender or sex-related organs, it clarifies it in next for the reader. I love the feeling like it was telling me the story. Its pov was hilarious to read.\nI love Murderbot, don't fight me on it.\n\nThe plot has mystery elements, action and suspense. The tech side of the setting was interesting. I can't wait to see more of the world and my beloved Murderbot in next installments.\nI laughed so much on Murderbot's constant jabs at the company and what a cheap asshats they are, as big corporations always are.\n\nI love the supporting cast of characters. It's a bunch of diverse individuals, many people of color, at least two of them are confirmed to be in polyamorous relationship. It's normalized in the world the story takes place in. The leader of the research team is Dr Mensah, woman of color; she's such a capable leader, she's smart and caring. I hope we'll get to see her in the next installments. The rest of the crew are Ratthi, Pin-Lee, Arada, Gurathin, Volescu and Bharadwaj. The dynamic between the team and Murderbot was so well developed, I love the dynamics!\n\nWhen I read novellas, I often want them to be a full-length novels. While I don't mind a full novel about Murderbot (@ Martha Wells, pretty please!), All Systems Red works perfectly as a novella, I wouldn't change a thing about it. And that last sentence of the book ended me, no kidding.\n\nI highly recommend to read it!\nI can't wait to read the sequel!!!\n\nCW: a bit of body horror, violence\n2017-releases\n11 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is snarky and has a surprising amount of depth for being \"just\" a SecUnit. It also hints at some larger potential conflict for the series at large possibly looking into themes about what makes a human or the difference between an all-meat human and a half-android human.\nLike\nComment"}

If you ever wanted to dive further into irreverent side characters of other books, this is it. The author has stripped down the story to its bare essence, focused on Murderbot and its running dialogue.\n\nTake a security construct, pull the governor that keeps it in check, give it immeasurable hours of soap operas and temperament that really can't stand humans, you've got Murderbot. It is hilarious that all it wants to do is keep its humans safe (which keeps its contract valid & the data feed going) and watch TV shows. The humans here are just background material, its all Murderbot.\n\nMy only gripe is this book and the next three are novellas, but are priced as full books. I suspect that Tor will offer the whole series of four next year as an omnibus. Otherwise, bring on Murderbot.\nscience-fiction-1\nLike\nComment"}

Only one of its humans even vaguely got the hang of interacting with it in a way that put it at ease (as little eye contact as possible, and preferably via text rather than talking).

There's a bit of action, but Murderbot isn't really a combat bot, it's a security bot with the cheapest possible software. Its fighting style isn't so much about brilliant skills and strategies as it is about throwing itself at an enemy until the enemy is dead, which is only possible because 1) Murderbot is hard to kill and 2) it has self-repairing abilities as long as it has access to its cubicle. I got a bit of a kick out of the difference between its reaction to its own injuries and the scientists' reactions. The scientists were worried because Murderbot's injuries would have killed a human, whereas Murderbot just wanted to avoid drawing attention to itself by having organic bits leak or fall off in public.\n\nI loved so much about Murderbot: its sense of humor, its desire to avoid having to spend too much time around its humans, its thoughts about corporate cheapness, and its devotion to Sanctuary Moon (hundreds of episodes long and counting).

Through the eyes of \"Murderbot\" (she's named herself that way), we experience what it is like to work with and for humans, that humans come in all forms (good and bad and everything in between), what the company creating these robots programs them to do (and what not) - and, ultimately, we learn how confusing and difficult it is to find oneself.\n\nMurderbot doesn't like humans very much. But it isn't hatred - rather, confusion. Add to that that she is SHY! Yep, a security bot made to kill people (and other stuff) is actually shy and would rather watch TV. *lol*\n\nThe writing was fast-paced and engaging, every character lively and distinct (not always easy, especially not in short stories) and the unobtrusive humour was delightful.\n\nI will definitely continue reading this series after the great ending to this and can't wait to know more about Murderbot's adventures and self-discovery that also teach us a lot about what it is to be \"human\".\n86 likes\n42 comments\nLike\nComment"}

The good parts were the price, inexpensive, and the length which was under four hours. So it wasn’t a huge commitment.\n\nShortly after listening to the book I was glad I had picked a short book. “Murderbot” wasn’t really fascinating as a character. The character had a lot of contradictions, and I didn’t like how it interacted with the rest of the crew. Also the character made a lot of decisions out of the blue (especially at the end) that didn’t make sense based on what they were doing before.\n\nFor me, the biggest problem is that there wasn’t a lot of human emotion to connect with, and while I get it that was the point, it just wasn’t entertaining.\n\nThe weird thing is, by the end of the book I was still interested in the story and really wishing the author had done it differently. The main character was itself still boring, but I was interested in some of the side characters.\n\nIt didn’t really do it for me. I wouldn’t call the book good or bad, mostly just filler.

It is evident all the way through that she knows what she is doing.

Sadly, that didn't happen...\n\nHere are my issues with this story (and I will be brief - not sure I have the time to mention them all...)\n\n* Why call the MC a \"Murderbot\" when it doesn't do anything of the sort. It protects the humans it is tasked with protecting. It gives a hint about some tragic past event but that is so obscure, even the bot doesn't remember what happened, so why it refers to itself in that way is beyond me.\n* The murderbot suffers from a malady found in Urban Fantasy - trying to out-snark itself with every line of dialogue. That was cool for the first 5 pages but from there, it was purely annoying.\n* The constant references by the murderbot to all the media it had access to, and watched while there was supposed to be a plot going on, was just overkill. I didn't care what this thing did to amuse itself - it is supposed to be a MURDERBOT!\n* Nothing really happens. Lots of things NEARLY happen but don't. Lots of dialogue, even more internal monologues from Murderbot.\n* Finally, there was no world-building. Just info dumps about people and places.\n\nAnd I am disappointed. I am hoping that the following stories are better and fill out the backstory a little more.\n\n\nPaul\nARH\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2018-05-19", "text": "Doreen\n3,242 reviews\n90 followers\nFollow\nMay 19, 2018\nLoads of fun, in large part due to the main character/narrator of Murderbot. That isn't actually Murderbot's name, but it's what our narrator chooses as a self-referential, and to tell you why would possibly tell you too much about this novella. Murderbot is a Security Unit, a half-machine half-organic being created solely to protect humans in a highly corporatized, planet-faring future. The plot itself is a somewhat straightforward adventure narrative laced with progressive sci-fi concepts. The military bits occasionally get elided enough for even me, the civilian, to notice, but any criticism is quickly subsumed by how awesome Murderbot is. And that's not to imply that Murderbot is some kind of hardcore badass (tho there are definitely moments of that): on the contrary, Murderbot's appeal comes largely from the flaws of this fascinating, self-aware being as Murderbot guides and protects a group of explorers on a dangerous planet.\n\nMurderbot, you see, is the epitome of socially hostile (\"antisocial\" and \"socially awkward\" just don't accurately describe the condition.) Murderbot would much rather sit in a Cubicle, watching entertainment feeds, than interact with humans. When circumstances force Murderbot into very personal quarters with the human members of the expedition, the results are both comic and almost painfully insightful into what it means to shun human company. Any introvert can empathize.\n\nI also really enjoyed the economy of emotion put into that ending, and am very much looking forward to the rest of the novellas in the series, tho I rather wish they could all have been published together in one volume to begin with. While I do think that this novella could have been fleshed out into a meatier novel, it is pretty great on its own, and its brevity lends itself to recommendation as an introduction to the joys of progressive hard sf.\ningress-book-club\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

And this time, it's not the planet that's dangerous! Action packed and original, this story gives the reader some of everything he or she would expect from a space exploration story, only this time we're getting it from the P.O.V. of a \"Unit.\" This is not your typical \"robot develops human emotions\" story. The \"Units\" are capable of having feelings, such as enjoyment, but like humans, they want a sense of purpose. Murderbot demonstrates all of these traits throughout the story, and earns the respect of his human contractors. This novella is brilliant and believable because, even in the \"future\" the same issues we are dealing with now are relevant within the story.

{"username": "", "date": "2018-05-21", "text": "Miki\n454 reviews\n3 followers\nFollow\nMay 21, 2018\nThe best thing of this novel is that the story is told from the point of view of a SecUnit, a formerly murderous, specialised robot with bio-organic parts whose job is protecting humans during their missions exploring and studying new planets, but who'd rather stay in its own cubicle watching TV shows (me too, SecUnit, me too). What makes things more interesting is the fact that this SecUnit hacked its own code and so it's free to decide whether or not to obey its humans and its company. Told in a relatable way (it doesn't take a robot to wish to stay away from humans, at least sometimes), the story follows the misadventures of its group and the way they cope in such unpredictable and dangerous circumstances. The interactions between the SecUnit and its humans are often more interesting than the actual plot, but I still would have liked more details on the final unfolding of the events. The open ending is perfectly true to the main character, it's not a cliffhanger but it raises the question of what's next.\nwomen-nb\nLike\nComment"}

What it was, though, was a funny, suspenseful, entertaining short novel that I readily enjoyed. This novella, which is in the first person, introduces us to a nameless security android, a self-designated \"murderbot\" that is owned by an equally nameless Company and appointed to protect a crew of several people on a scientific surveying mission on an uninhabited planet.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Company, and the clients, however, is that this murderbot has hijacked his/its governor unit, the component that makes him/it beholden to orders and that keeps it in check. Fortunately for the crew, however, this AI isn't very good at being a murderbot. It would much rather immerse itself in the serials (tv shows) it has downloaded and that it watches in copious amounts during its idle time.\n\nUnfortunately for the murderbot and the crew, however, things begin to go suspiciously wrong at the encampment. Equipment is inexplicably malfunctioning or defective, and the surveyors of another site, on the other side of the planet, aren't answering communication hails. Everything seems to be indicating fowl play. Is our lazy hero going to have to actually do his job and face an unknown threat trying to kill his clients?\n\n\n\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

I find A.I.’s to be one of the coolest characters in sci-fi stories (so much possibilities), and Murderbot is a great addition to the club. Murdering people is a lot of work; why not watch Netflix instead?\n\nIn this entertaining space adventure, it’s snarky and rogue A.I. (wrapped in a flesh body wearing a suit of armor) steals the show. As a SecUnit Murderbot should take care of this team of humans researching an empty astroid, but it would much rather be left alone and watch episodes of Sailor Moon all day.\nYet when it's humans gets attacked, Murderbot is forced to do what it hates: interact with them.\n\n\"Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into the monster’s mouth.\"\n\nThe plot is straight-forward and the dialogue easy, and combined with the reculant friendship between Murderbot and its humans, this was a charming read.\nYet I could never really understand the world and the technological systems that the bots and people use. They all know how the technology works so there is no need to explain something to us, which lowered my enjoyment of this story.\n\nStill, if Murderbot stays as deadpan and the world-building expands, I would love to continue this series. Snark in space is always good 😁\nscience-fiction\n \nshort-fiction\n18 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Our narrator is the unnamed Murderbot, a security cyborg guarding an exploration team on an uncharted planet. When technical glitches start putting the team's lives at risk, the question is if this is more lowest-bidder failures from the profit minded Company, or if something greater is afoot. The team's survival depends on their ace in the hole. Murderbot is no simply security unit. He hacked his programming governor is an autonomous unit who's been obeying commands because the charade keeps anyone from looking at him.\n\nThis first novella and the narrator are ironic, acerbic, and warm at heart. While I wasn't totally satisfied with the resolution of the initial mystery (the potential profits of alien artifacts inspired a rival team to eliminate the competition by any means necessary), the main characters has a lot of promise. Looking forward to the next one.\n\n***\n\n2021 reread: I got the first four books of the series, so started with one since my memory was flaky. Still pretty damn good, especially MurderBot's voice, with promise on the other elements.\n2018\n \n2021\n \nsci-fi\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Doctor Mensah is an obvious exception since Murderbot respects her so much.\n\nThe structure of the novella is also a bit wonky. It starts relatively slow, and then there's a series of dramatic events before the story ends very abruptly, possibly too quickly.\n\nI also feel like I should address the Apple TV adaptation of this novella, which manages to capture the tone and feel of the story while making some pretty massive changes. Quite a few of the supporting characters have been cut (the fact that it works as well as it does suggests that Wells probably didn't need the Pres Aux team to be as big as it is in the novella - no wonder I keep getting the characters confused). Skarsgård plays an excellent Murderbot, even though he's not Murderbot as I imagine it (the Murderbot in my head is female presenting, more like Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth rather than tall, handsome and Scandinavian), and I can't help but think that our favourite SecUnit's extreme social awkwardness is portrayed so well since Skarsgård is so familiar with Scandinavians and our weird introverted way of being. No one in Scandinavia likes being talked to by strangers or having FEELINGS shared all over them.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the adaptation is the choice to have scenes from Murderbot's favourite media shown to the viewers. If I wasn't already pretty sure I'd be hooked on Sanctuary Moon, seeing the brief snippets of it on screen confirms it. There is still an episode left to go, but so far, I think the show may be dealing with the confusing end section of the story better than in the novella. Time will tell.\n\nJune 2018: 4.5 stars\n\nRecently, I read Binti by Nnedi Okorafor, which won the 2016 Nebula award for best novella. I was rather underwhelmed by that story. All Systems Red just won the Nebula for best novella for 2018, and I thought that was a much more deserving winner - and a much more engaging and well-written story besides.\n\nI think a lot of introverted and nerdy readers on the internet can identify with Murderbot, who has hacked its own governor module and spends all of its downtime (and any other spare moments it can get away with it) consuming the countless hours of entertainment media it has sneakily downloaded. As it points out in the very first lines of the novella, it could have become a mass murdering killing machine after hacking its governor module, but with all that media to consume, who has the time? Murderbot finds social interaction deeply awkward and absolutely hates small talk and especially talking about feelings of any kind, which makes the fact that several of the scientists keep trying to engage it in conversation and treating it as an important member of the crew, not just a mindless droid (it's not mindless, of course, but it also would rather be left alone). Muderbot loves its armour and hates having to be without it, which becomes a bit of an issue as the story goes on - its duty is to protect the scientists and unexpectedly, what was supposed to be a pretty routine research mission turns out to be really rather dangerous.\n\nThe first instalment of The Murderbot Diaries is an excellent example of why I keep trying science fiction, a genre that is more often than not miss than hit for me. It's not that I hate all sci-fi stories, it's just that the ones that I really like and that manage to really engage me emotionally are few and far between. Since Murderbot clearly is some sort of spiritual cousin to Marvin the Paranoid Android (I first read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in my early teens) and also has many of the same anxious reactions to socialising as I frequently do, not to mention wants nothing but to be left alone and consume mindless entertainment, I (like so many other readers) couldn't help but love it.\n\nThe second novella in this series is out now, but I'm not allowing myself to read it until I'm fully and completely caught up on my backlog. Happily, while it's taking a while, I am slowly but surely churning out reviews and should be able to read about Murderbot's next adventure soon.\n\nJudging a book by its cover: This cover shows Murderbot, in its armour that it finds so comforting, front and centre. The background is suitably ominous, considering the contents of the story. I like that the art is done in such a way that this almost looks like black and white, except it's not.\nall-books-read-25\n \nbacklist-2018\n \ncbr10\n \n...more\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2024-12-19", "text": "Babbs\n261 reviews\n84 followers\nFollow\nDecember 19, 2024\nThe self-named Murderbot, is a personal security SecUnit robot with a combination of organic and inorganic components, and is a required purchase when exploring new and potentially hostile worlds. Our own Murderbot has managed to hack the controls that allow her a level of autonomous control over her own actions, though for her own safety she must conceal this fact and play as though she's forced to comply. I'm unsure if this made her more aware of her servitude, or how much she cares about this in general, considering her lackadaisical reaction to so much of her surroundings.\n\nThere is a quote that sums this up that goes something like beings that appear to bugs as gods wouldn't be concerned with the lives of said bugs... but being lazy I can't find it, so fist bump to Murderbot on that front. You get how this could make her disinterested in the lives of her charges, so we're good.\n\nMy initial impression of Murderbot is that of a teenage girl forced to attend some sort of family outing--irritated that the adult is forcing her to do some chore. As her character expands we get that it's more similar to a 2 year old being put in charge of an adult scientist and ordering them to scrap a complex experiment in favor of spraying the wall with a water gun. It isn't petulance as much as exacerbation at being forced to follow the commands of beings who aren't capable of processing data the way that she is, and those same individuals in charge often make the wrong decision, leading to her cleaning up a mess. Once again, a babysitter with guns in her arms. This leads to the major action points of the book, which is the discovery that the information they have about the world, and that there might be more than simple scientific teams exploring the area.\n\nWe get a glimpse of how Murderbot is typically treated by her human contracts, in her indifference to actually learn anything about them or to be invested in anything other than doing the bare minimum to keep them alive. We get more of this when the crew discusses how they should interact with her, with some in the crew use human pronouns, while others refer to Muderbot simply as \"it\".\n\nThere is more I'd like to discuss, particularly the ending, but it tends to be quite spoilery, so I'll leave it here. It's an intriguing start to a series, where a sentient robot isn't in the middle of self discovery, or some greater quest for meaning, but simply is. She can pick her own actions, which would be an overwhelming amount of freedom for a being that hasn't experienced this previously, or has had her own wishes overridden and then had to live with the consequences, and in my simple human mind, Murderbot's reaction is maybe more believable. This is particularly so when you factor in that she never has the same time pressures faced by humans in a similar situation, all she has to do is wait.\n\n\n** Rounding conundrum as I'd rank it somewhere between 3 to 4 stars, but decided it just wasn't quite a 4 star read for me. I'm hoping the next in the series gives the story that extra little nudge to \"really liked it\".\nfantasy-scifi\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Essentially, a security robot hacked its own control system so it no longer has to obey humans. It could have gone on a murder spree, but decided it would rather stream Netflix instead. (Or at least the far future equivalent.) This means having to pretend it's still a regular, functioning security robot and doing at least the minimum amount of work required so it can keep up with its favorite soaps and avoid being dismantled.\n\nOf course, if things went that smoothly this book wouldn't exist. Murderbot is protecting a planetary survey team that finds itself under attack from unknown forces. For once, the security robot has to actually do its job, placing itself in extreme danger both of getting blown apart in combat and worse, being exposed to the humans it works with.\n\nThe most adorable thing about Murderbot is how painfully shy it is. If anything, this is a story about social anxiety and the desire to hide yourself away from the world, even if you have retractable cannons built into your forearms. The ending in particular shows a lot of promise for where this series may be headed in the final (and possibly first) choices Murderbot ever gets to make for itself.\nbooks-finished\n \nnovella\n \nother-worlds\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

The \"Muderbot\" (a term it uses when referring to itself) is actually a charmingly self-conscious security android assigned to a crew of planet surveyors. It has hacked its governor module and has become completely autonomous, but doesn't quite know what to do with itself now. All it really wants to do is to be left alone and watch soap operas, but continues its security assignment for fear of being found out by The Company.\n\nThe story is a fun little mystery, but the best parts of the book are the Muderbot's internal monologue.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2010s", "text": "Tim\n491 reviews\n837 followers\nFollow\nJune 6, 2018\nNote: There will be quotes in this review. Many of them. Murderbot is so delightfully quotable, that I think it speaks for itself better than I ever could.\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nIt’s borderline uncomfortable how much I relate to Murderbot. I really feel like I should not have anything in common with, well… a Murderbot, but I relate far more to this machine than pretty much any other protagonist I’ve read in some time. Murderbot is sarcastic, snide, a bit more kindhearted than one would expect given the name, but most of all, really just wants to be left alone with its hobbies.\n\n“It was a low-stress group, they didn’t argue much or antagonize each other for fun, and were fairly restful to be around, as long as they didn’t try to talk or interact with me in any way.”\n\nMurderbot is a security-based robot who is in charge of watching a group of scientists who have, for some reason, become a target for some unknown organization. They are on an isolated planet, their systems have been hacked, their maps are missing key points, hostile creatures want to eat them, other security robots are being reprogramed to attack them and worst of all they want to talk to Murderbot about its feelings.\n\n“Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\"\n\nAs you may have noticed from the quotes, Murderbot is rather sarcastic, snide and humorously antisocial. It really would rather watch sci-fi soap operas and do its job (in its own words, in a rather “half assed fashion”), but people want to understand it, and yes, it does feel enough responsibility to want to keep its clients alive… well, most of them.\n\nThe book is rather hilarious. I hate to compare it to Douglas Adams, as Adams was more consistently absurd, but the humor throughout this book worked for me so well that I can honestly say I haven’t laughed this hard at a science fiction book since I originally ready The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and that is extremely high praise indeed.\n\nThis was almost a 5 star read for me. Its length is very short (around 150 pages) and had it been longer with expansion upon the plot and a more satisfactory ending, it probably would have made that last star. It also suffers a bit from having fairly forgettable meatbag… excuse me, I mean human characters. As things stand though, it is still a solid 4 star read and I’m looking forward to continuing the series at some point. It won me over with its loveable misanthropic protagonist, a great sense of humor and some genuinely interesting ideas.\n\n“I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.”\n\nWell said Murderbot!

The way this explored artificial intelligence was really nteresting to me and the plot was fast paced and really tense at some points. I couldn't put this down. This book actually reminded me a bit of A Closed And Common Orbit but more murdery. Murderbot is just a really great character to read about. Alas it's the only character we really learn about? I would have liked for the secondary characters to be a bit more... Just more. I couldn't even tell you their name right now. But the author nailed Murderbot and that is the most important right?\nadult\n \nsci-fi\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

It reads like short story as the plot is fairly self-contained and straightforward. We get one solid POV. No flashbacks. Just about 48 hours or so of fast-paced story that doesn’t insult your intelligence with Mary Sues or deus ex machinas.\n\nIt was not what I was expecting, but in a good way.

{"username": "", "date": "I really enjoyed 'All Systems Red' by Martha Wells. The story of a part organic, part robotic security unit, or SecUnit, tasked with looking after a small group of scientists and technicians on an expedition to another planet.\n\nIt's told from the point of view of the SecUnit, who, after secretly hacking and disabling the governor module that controls its behaviour and obedience, now refers to itself (if only in private) as Murderbot, and is painfully shy and would rather be watching the serials they've downloaded from the entertainment feeds, mostly of a show called 'Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon', than interact with people. But when suspicious things start happening, as well as another research station suddenly going off line, SecUnit reluctantly has to get involved with the expedition group to find out what is happening and is surprised to find that they want to protect 'their humans'.\n\nIts a fast paced and enjoyable read, a mix of science fiction and thrilling mystery. I liked the setting up of the corporate funded expeditions and the world building that surrounded it. I got vibes of Duncan Jones' 'Moon' movie with a big conglomo that only cares about profit and does things on the cheap. The character of SecUnit was really well fleshed out and I liked the personality that came through slowly as the bot came to terms of having to interact with the group of researchers it was there to protect, becoming more human than robot. Although it's written as an androgynous cyborg, I had the impression of it being female for some reason. Dr Mensah, the lead on the expedition, and the rest of the scientists and technicians came across as likeable and were a well knit team, even Dr Gurathin, who was suspicious of the SecUnit. Each had their own personalities and concerns, making them seem like a real group of people rather than just a bunch of generic scientists on an expedition.\n\nThe only downside for me is that it was over too quickly, as I was really enjoying the novella, but as it's the first in a series of four stories, the next being 'Artificial Condition', which is now available (as of May 2018), I will definitely be looking forward to reading more of the Murderbot Diaries.", "text": "Andy\n325 reviews\n30 followers\nFollow\nJune 4, 2018\nI really enjoyed 'All Systems Red' by Martha Wells.

It follows a SecUnit (who calls himself Murderbot) protecting a crew while they explore a planet. Along the way he encounters danger, tolerates humans, and shares his witty point of view. The novella is engaging, funny and action packed. As Murderbot slowly starts to reveal he in a sentient A.I. he describes the strangeness of human social interactions. Through his eyes the nature of the crew's mission unravels, with suspense, as they face danger and threats no one was prepared for.\n\n\n\"The humans hadn’t gotten a lot of sleep last night, from the crowding and the strong possibility of dying.\"\n\nThe pacing, story and plot flowed together effortlessly. You will quickly become immersed with Murderbot who is not human,  but has a soft spot for them. In a short amount of pages I cared about the characters and enjoyed the simply explained sci-fi elemenst. In this future where humans are not constrained to their planet, I was happy to see diverse characters included. I really wanted more of everything, but had to reminded myself there will be more books. I will be continuing on with the series and hope it maintains its great momentum.\n\n\n\"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\"\n\nRecommended for Readers who\n- enjoy funny action packed stories\n- want a quick entertaining read\n- want to cheer for a socially awkward sentient robot\nfavorite\n \nhumor\n \nsci-fi\n13 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2018-06-09", "text": "Michael Smith\n1,925 reviews\n66 followers\nFollow\nJune 9, 2018\nWells has written most fantasy novels of a type that just doesn’t appeal to me, so I was only slightly aware of her work. But this one is straight, hardcore science fiction, and it’s quite good. The narrator is nameless because he’s a construct -- more than an “enhanced human,” less than a full machine, designed to be hired out for security work. But “SecUnit,” as the humans for whom he works sometimes call him, has hacked his own governor module, making him a free agent, and because of his often bloody past he has come to think of himself as “Murderbot.” His current assignment is to protect an exploration and scientific survey party of a dozen or so as they look over a new world, to decide whether it’s worth developing. He does the minimum to get by, at least at first, because he doesn’t care that much about the humans and he’d rather immerse himself in the entertainment info channel. But it gradually becomes apparent that someone, somewhere, is attempting to sabotage the group’s activities and Murderbot can’t allow that.\n\nThis isn’t a terribly long story -- only 150 pages, about the same as one and a half novellas -- but the action is almost continual, so it seems longer. The narrator has a very dry, occasionally self-deprecating sense of humor. This feels very much like the old ANALOG type of action story, but brought up to date. And best of all, it’s only the first in a series.\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is a novella following a team of researchers on a planet who suddenly discover something nefarious going on. They have to rely on their assigned security robot, a SecUnit which calls itself Murderbot, to help them get out of their predicament without injury. Unbeknownst to them, their bot has hacked its “governor” module controlling its actions, giving it free will to do almost whatever it pleases.\n\nThis bot was so unique and multi-layered, and that’s one thing I loved about this story. Murderbot liked to watch streams of a television-like program in its downtime, it looked like a human but wore its protective suit almost exclusively to dehumanize itself, while having remarkably human reactions and facial expressions, and had emotion, but hated human emotion or interacting with humans...mostly because it was shy. It’s inner dialogue was engaging, with a good dose of humor mixed in. The humans were initially vague and indistinctly drawn, but as the plot moved along, I grew to like many of them, especially their leader, Dr. Mensah.\n\nThis novella had pretty much nonstop action. The ending was a bit abrupt, but I’ll definitely read the rest of the series, and more from this author.\ndigital\nLike\nComment"}

Their crippling, nigh-autistic social anxiety at dealing with people made my heart twinge – basically Murderbot is SO SWEET and is my favourite and they must be protected at all costs.\n\nIt’s also an interesting world, and I loved the worldbuilding about the soulless corporations and how they rent out equipment to surveying teams, and the ramifications of their constantly cutting corners. I think the only thing is that I would have liked even more information/exposition about this universe; e.g. there’s a point where a crucial detail is revealed, but because you don’t know anything about the planet-nations in this world, you don’t really know what that entails.

{"username": "", "date": "Mon Avis : Cette novella, j’ai mis longtemps à me lancer à me décider à la découvrir. Et encore, c’est principalement dû à un concours de circonstances que j’ai décidé de finalement la lire. Pourtant, au moment de sa publication j’étais tenté de la découvrir rapidement. La couverture, illustrée par Jaime Jones, donnait franchement envie et les premiers retours que j’avais lu à droite et à gauche était très positifs. Puis le retour d’Apophis et un ou deux autres avis beaucoup plus nuancés m’ont alors refroidi. Il y a peu la communication sur le second tome a commencé, ce qui m’a fait me repencher sur cette novella qui continuait à avoir d’excellentes notes sur Goodreads, sur des blog que je suis et qui a été nominée pour de nombreux prix. Puis, Tor ayant alors décidé il y a peu d’offrir l’ebook, j’ai donc décidé de me faire mon propre avis.\n\nCe récit, d’à peu près 140 pages, nous fait découvrir Murderbot, qui s’est appelé ainsi par lui-même, qui est un androïde de sécurité qui a été embauché pour suivre une mission scientifique qui doivent mener des tests sur une planète. il est un androïde un peu particulier, en effet il a l’air d’avoir une conscience et a hacké son module son « governor module », qui le maintenait sous contrôle. Il est ainsi devenu d’une certaine façon indépendant. Il s’ennuie énormément durant sa mission jusqu’au moment ou des évènements meurtriers et étranges vont apparaitre. Il va devoir trouver la vérité s’il veut remplir son but de protéger ce groupe de scientifique. Alors, finalement s’agit-il d’une bonne surprise? Hé, malheureusement, non, car même si je suis peut-être un peu moins critique qu’Apophis (et encore je viens de me relire), j’ai, pour ma part, moi aussi trouvé que cette novella se révélait très moyenne, voir trop moyenne. Disons que pour résumer elle rentre dans le vite lu, déjà-vu et tout aussi vite oublié, la preuve je viens de ressortir ma liseuse pour écrire cette chronique, tant il y a des éléments dont je ne me souvenais plus. Mais j’y reviendrais plus tard.\n\nDéjà, concernant l’intrigue, rien de bien révolutionnaire. On est sur une course en avant du groupe pour tenter de survivre face à une menace inconnue. Le rythme est présent, oui ça va vite, très vite, le soucis c’est que voilà, l’intrigue n’a rien de complexe, a du mal à s’imposer, ce qui fait qu’elle a par conséquent aussi du mal à captiver. On a l’impression d’une idée qui a été mise en place rapidement et traitée tout aussi rapidement. Cette histoire de mission qui doit rester secrète et autre n’a jamais réussi à me happer, à me passionner pour la simple raison qu’il manque un truc qui me donnerait envie de comprendre. Il faut dire aussi que l’histoire est balayée tellement rapidement qu’il est dur d’arriver à entrer dans l’intrigue sans être déjà à la conclusion. En plus Martha Wells a le don d’utiliser des ellipses qui sont légèrement frustrantes, principalement dans la conclusion, qui donne vraiment l’impression de dire « pif pouf » j’ai rempli mon intrigue, voilà mais j’ai laissé plein de trous non expliqués. Ça ne devrait pas se voir.\n\nConcernant l’univers construit au fil des pages, là aussi finalement nous restons très en surface avec cette idée de compagnies qui s’entredéchirent, d’argent facile et de profit qui prennent le pas sur la morale. Cela aurait pu être sympa, si cela avait été construit de façon plus solide, car comme l’ensemble de cette novella tout parait finalement traité dans de très très grandes lignes. Là où le récit doit normalement gagner en intérêt c’est normalement sur l’androïde et là, à nouveau, je dirai bof. On est sur des idées déjà vues et revues, principalement concernant l’androïde qui se trouve une conscience, mais qui est encore une fois amenée sans finesse et de façon trop rapide. On a vraiment l’impression que l’autrice, devant une deadline qui se rapprochait, a décidé d’écrire un texte vite fait, bien fait, histoire de remplir un objectif. Le soucis est que si vous avez déjà un minimum de connaissance en science-fiction, vous pourriez ressortir grandement déçu. Si on ajoute a cela des poins importants frustrants car ils ne sont pas expliqué, franchement un androïde qui pirate son logiciel de contrôle comme ça entre le plat et le dessert, et surtout que personne ne le remarque clairement, ça m’a laissé perplexe. Je n’attends pas obligatoirement un univers d’une grande richesse, voir un truc de hard science, ou encore un récit hautement intelligent, mais voilà pour moi l’ensemble ne tient pas la route tant il n’est même pas expliqués et que l’autrice nous demande d’accepter trop de choses.\n\nConcernant les personnages j’aurai pu ne rien vous dire car, et c’est là que je reviens sur mon besoin de recherche dans le récit, mis à part peut-être un peu Murderbot, aucun n’arrive à s’imposer ou à se révéler un tant soit peu intéressant. Il y a, à peu près, une interaction avec au moins 8 à 10 personnages et, autant être clair, ils m’ont quasiment tous paru interchangeables tant ils ne sont jamais un tant soit peu développés. Aucun d’entre eux n’est un minimum développé. Il y a bien Mensah qui arrive vaguement à se dégager de cet ensemble, mais elle s’avère assez rapidement caricaturale et surtout ne parait être là que pour finalement faire avancer l’intrigue vu que, bien entendu aux vues des réflexions soulevées, il faut un Humain pour diriger l’équipe. Car oui, c’est vrai le principal intérêt de ce roman vient surtout du traitement de Murderbot, des questions qu’il doit venir soulever sur la notion d’humanité, de personne, de personnalité et aussi d’interaction avec les autres. Sauf que voilà, autant le dire tout de suite, même si cela reste sympa, à nouveau l’autrice ne fait que traiter le sujet en surface et il existe de nombreux autres romans qui offrent, un travail, je trouve plus intéressant. L’autre soucis aussi avec ce héros c’est qu’il n’arrive jamais justement à trouver sa place, oscillant justement entre humanité et machine sans qu’on comprenne vraiment pourquoi et montrant que le récit n’a jamais vraiment réussi à trouver le bon ton pour le présenter.\n\nAlors oui, c’est vrai, cette novella se lit vite et je pense qu’elle plaira à tous ceux qui apprécient justement les récits qui vont rapidement à l’essentiel, ne viennent pas prendre la tête, tout en offrant une ou deux réflexions faciles et simples. Peut-être elle plaira aussi si à ceux qui souhaiteraient un moment de détente sans prise de tête, pour ma part j’ai surtout eu l’impression d’un texte qui a eu du mal à me convaincre, mais qui, peut-être, aurait pu être solide et intéressant s’il avait été traité sous la forme d’un roman et non d’une novella. Au final tout va trop vite, rien n’est vraiment original, tout est amené précipitamment et donne l’impression d’avoir en partie raté le coche. Concernant la plume de Martha Wells, elle est simple, mais franchement elle n’a rien de révolutionnaire ni de vraiment marquante. Certes le côté froid vient du fait qu’elle cherche à donner voix à son héros et narrateur Murderbot, mais il y a une différence entre le côté froid donné à un androïde et l’aspect blasé et morne d’un personnage qui parait plus s’ennuyer qu’autre chose. Après, je n’étais peut-être pas le public cible pour ce texte, car au vu de la réussite qu’il a aux US il a réussi à trouver son public.\n\nSur le blog.", "text": "Black Wolf\n22 reviews\n1 follower\nFollow\nJune 10, 2018\nMon Avis : Cette novella, j’ai mis longtemps à me lancer à me décider à la découvrir.

I actually really liked Gurathin and how suspicious and untrusting he was of Murderbot; I wouldn't be opposed to having him be a supporting character in the second book. I also really liked the subtle relationship building between Mensah and Murderbot, and though I understand Murderbot's decision in the end, I still felt sad about it.\n\nAs for the plot it's tight, action packed and great. The best way I can explain it is if the Purge was set in space; it's a short, simple plot that lets us know the characters and the world and kept me invested and reading.\n\nI will definitely continue this series and can't wait to see what Murderbot gets up to next.\nfavorites\n \nread-and-own\nLike\nComment"}

And I agree with it. But the story is about much more than that. It has adventure and murders and a bit of a mystery and tough decisions to make.\n\nI think that, like with every good book in the history of books, this story makes you question things. It draws parallels with contemporary life and it asks of you to think.\n\nOr you could just read it for the murder and the advanced weapons and the science fiction behind the worldbuilding and enjoy it.\n\nEither way, I'm already halfway through the next book.\nfav-otherwordlyish\n \nfav-series\n \nfavourites-forever-and-ever\n8 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "read-2018", "text": "Dara\n216 reviews\n56 followers\nFollow\nJuly 30, 2018\nAll Systems Red is a bit of a cliched self-aware robot story. The bot refers to itself as a murderbot, doesn't really care for humans, and has no desire to connect with its clients. This could easily feel tired but Martha Wells has crafted an interesting world and story for her flawed Murderbot to live in.\n\nThere isn't much room for in-depth worldbuilding in a 144 page novella but Wells packs enough in for the reader to understand the setting and why things are the way that they are. The story is told in first person from the Murderbot's POV so there isn't too much depth to the secondary characters. The Murderbot is kind of an unlikable character at first (at least it reminded me of a toxic former friend) but gradually evolves.\n\nThis was a 3.5 star read for me until the end. I had certain expectations that Wells deftly flipped on its ear and I was pleasantly surprised. I'll definitely read the rest of the series.\n\nA-\nchallenge-laser\n \nlady-author\n \nread-2018\n \n...more\n1 like\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

I found that this book kept me guessing, not give up to much so that I could just guess what was going to happen next.\n\nSo to start and the beginning, the book gets straight to the point, I personally would have liked a little longer of an introduction, however if you want to just jump straight into the book then you will love this.\n\nThe author did a good job of discrimination the surrounds that I could understand the location. I would have liked a little better description so I could really picture the scene (this is where the longer intro would have paid off). However there was enough there to make it make sense.\n\nThe story line was great in my opinion. This book kept me on the end he of my seat asking for more.

So, had I have had any incling that this is a novella, I wouldn't have picked it up.\n\nI'm so glad I didn't know.\n\nRemember how I said short fiction doesn't allow me enough time to start caring about its characters? I started caring about Murderbot on page three. She - for me it's definitely a female - is a robot, who hacked its command module and is now basically in possession of free will. Now she loves watching serialized dramas, is vulnerable, shy and most definitely an introvert. She also very deeply cares about the humans she was charged with protecting, and she happens to be very good at it, while shrugging off any attention or gratitude - not because she's indifferent to it, but because she's NOT and so... the feels!\n\nI love Murderbot so much.\naudiobook\n \nsci-fi\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I'd never read or heard of Martha Wells before but now she's on my radar! This book is very short but took me far too long to read because I was on a trip and couldn't focus on it. I had to restart it twice. Once I got home I sat down with it and plowed through it. This book is in the POV of a security robot on a spaceship. It calls itself Murderbot, but only in private. I pictured Murderbot as a woman, I don't know why, maybe because it's a female author? But it is genderless. And it has feelings and emotions that it probably shouldn't have. Murderbot has deactivated its governor module so it can choose to follow commands or not. That sounds incredibly dangerous for all humans involved! This was a very interesting book and I look forward to reading more of the series!

This one stands out because of the humor that Wells put into it. The protagonist murderbot just wants to chill and watch his entertainment videos. But events conspire to interrupt his malingering. The action then comes fast and furious. One of the themes the this story explores is prejudice against \"foreigners\". The human guardians of the robot, probably rightly considering he's called a murderbot, are wary to an extreme that puts their lives in jeopardy, even when they realize he's not out to kill them. This is an self-contained story, but sets up an interesting universe for a series. The ending is perhaps a bit too pat, and I thought the murderbot's recuperative powers were somewhat unbelievable, but I look forward to further murderbot stories.\n2018-hugo-campbell-nominees\n \ne-book\nLike\nComment"}

At this point it's definitely a comfort read for me - perhaps because I can empathize with Murderbot's \"becoming\" - not wanting to be human but being alive and part of humanity at the same time. I like this description of the word (from dictionary.com): \"Aristotelianism. any change involving realization of potentialities, as a movement from the lower level of potentiality to the higher level of actuality.\"\nfavorites\n \ntor\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2018-06-27", "text": "Aelvana\n1,451 reviews\n26 followers\nFollow\nJune 27, 2018\nA team of researchers are conducting tests on a newly discovered planet's surface, accompanied by one company-provided SecUnit that privately calls itself Murderbot. Although Murderbot behaves like the equipment it's supposed to be, it actually overrode some of its own programming so it can function more autonomously. And that becomes critical when unexpected dangers arise . . .\n\nI liked this well enough, but it's far too short. Murderbot is the only character with significant development---the team is fleshed out enough to see why Murderbot appreciates their low-stress interactions, but ultimately it means most of the team was interchangeable for me, except for the enhanced human (because he was the only one Murderbot felt cautious about, and not unreasonably, given his suspicions towards it in return).\n\nIt was funny to find that someone who calls itself \"Murderbot\" is a huge introvert who doesn't actually like people at all. Murderbot would rather watch entertainment than deal with actual humanity.\n\nMost of the fight scenes felt poorly described, as well. Murderbot narrates several gunfights with little more than \"and here's where each bullet hit\" kind of description, which made it hard to feel much of a flow to the fighting or much of a sense of danger. I was very annoyed where one fight described all the damage to the opposing forces first, and only then cataloged Murderbot's injuries. My initial impression had been that Murderbot somehow hadn't been hit, since segregating things that way feels like it drains all the tension out of a fight.\n\nOverall this was interesting enough that I will probably read the next book, but between the short length and the lack of anything that really grabbed me, it's not on my buy list. (Besides, the ebook price is insane. The book is only 140 pages long.) I rate this book Recommended.\n\nSee my reviews and more at https://offtheshelfreviews.wordpress....\nLike\nComment"}

A great concept already, adding a delightful dash of humour from the introverted Murderbot's all-too-human laziness and awkwardness. This could begin to grate and can feel almost too human in places, but that's where point 2 comes in...\n\n2) All Systems Red smartly stays as a novella so the story, which ultimately is rather tried and true if it weren't for the narrator, never overstays its welcome. This does have some drawbacks as most concepts (such as the sprawling implications of seemingly all these units being sentient as well as wider worldbuilding) cannot be expanded upon but that's not really what the book is designed to do.\n\nIf you want a super quick, enjoyable sci-fi read, look no further. Read and then reread almost exactly two years later in preparation for diving into the rest of the series.

It was as great the second time around. For such a short book it sure packs a punch. Since there are close to 600 reviews just in Amazon I will skip the summary and just affirm how great it is. For a Murderbot it sure has a lot of emotions. I think why I like this so much is that we all understand how doing the best that we can and sometimes is not enough. We all try for redemption. At the same time, we all get apathetic and bored. We all get afraid and sometimes do not know how to act in social situations. I cannot wait to finish the second book.\nLike\nComment"}

A constructed being that supposedly malfunctioned and killed 57 innocent people, but that is owned by a company so cheap that it got rebuilt and put back into service? And that freed itself from one of its command modules and uses that freedom to binge-watch TV?\nThe story itself is an interesting one, although I had problems with the big reveal, since it was never explained to the reader how some of the reveal actually worked.

Nonetheless the narrator was an interesting character in and of themselves, the story universe was compelling, and it was a decent genre read.\n\nA survey team on a remote and dangerous planet experiences curious problems and technical glitches which lead them to suspect sabotage by an unknown party. It's told form the point of view of their Security Unit - a free agent android who's hacked it's own behavior governor so it can spend less time reading and responding to briefings and updates and more time watching downloaded soap operas.\n\nKnowing it's continued \"freedom\" relies on the appearance of proper obedient function it does its best to maintain this illusion--until it can't, and is forced to trust it's companions with its secrets as they co-operate on a plan to escape the planet.\nLike\nComment"}

The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\n\nI'm not much of a sci-fi gal, since the jargon and overall concepts usually confuse me. I also am just not really into futuristic stories or stories set in space, since I can't conceptualize a lot of whats going on. But after having some success with the Illuminae Files series, I'm intrigued by the genre. I picked up All Systems Red because it's less than 150 pages and I've seen some pretty good reviews of it, so I figured if I should start with sci-fi anywhere, it should be here.\n\nOverall, I liked this book. Murderbot is hilarious and honestly one of the most relatable characters I've come across. The trope of a self-aware AI with a sense of humor is always so funny and appealing to me, and I loved reading from its point-of-view. I think it's pretty awesome when an author can make a robot relatable.\n\nI, for some reason, got a very femme vibe from Murderbot, even though it has no gender. I've never gotten a female impression from any AI I've ever read, but there's something about this antisocial queen that tugged on my heartstrings. Maybe I just saw a bit too much of myself in Murderbot. I think one of the funniest parts of the book is when Dr. Mensah asked if Murderbot would like to spend time with the crew, and Murderbot--who cannot control its facial expressions readily--gives a look of absolute horror at the prospect of spending time with people. Like, bitch, me too. Talking to people is hard. Murderbot also stands in the corner of the room facing the wall when talking in group settings and I just wish that behavior was acceptable for me, because same.\n\nThe writing is a little choppy and not very pretty, but I've never read anything else by Martha Wells, so I'm not sure if this was a tactic to make it truly seem like a robot was telling us the story or if she's just a writer who doesn't care about whether her words sound nice. I didn't hate it, but sometimes the choppy wording and sentences could be a tad awkward and I would have to reread them. But the writing lent itself to letting the story move fast, which I always like.\n\nWhat flopped in this book for me was the plot and the ending. The last two chapters were confusing and vague, and I couldn't tell you what the GrayCris group was trying to accomplish and why Murderbot's group had anything to do with it. It was never explained, and I found the fact that Murderbot was unconcious for a majority of the action scenes to be a tad lazy on the author's part. The last chapter was also weird, I don't understand quite what happened since it seemed like everything important had been completely missed by Murderbot and no one bothered to explain it to them. The last few pages seemed out of character for Murderbot as well, and I have no idea why it ended that way or where it will take us in the future.\n\nI know this is a series with 3 more books, so I'm guessing we'll learn a lot more about that planet they were on, their mission, the GrayCris group, and why everything happened the way it did. But it seems kind of silly to me to have a 150 page book were things sort of happened and but never got explained. I wanted to love this story, because I really love Murderbot, but nothing seemed to make much sense by the end.\n\nI will definitely continue the series since these books are so short and I want more of Murderbot's hilarious narration. I just hope that this story doesn't go in a completely random direction like the ending seemed to promise.

I found my mind kept wandering; I just was not taken by the story. It's not bad, but there are scenes where there should have been so much more tension and for some reason the writing didn't provide it.\nfiction\n \nsci-fi\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Instead of using its new free will to kill all humans with its superior firepower, it is spending its time doing the bare minimum at its job and watching hours upon hours of entertainment serials. However, circumstances on this planet become dangerous as SecUnit's humans discover forces are hiding something from them about this planet. SecUnit is a enjoyable character to get to know despite or because of his antisocial attitude and apathy. Some readers might describe the book as thin and wish for a more developed novel to really flesh out some of the questions raised within. However, it should be recognized that there is surprising depth here for a fast paced, action packed novella. Although this isn't as humorous as Scalzi, his fans should give this a try.\nLike\nComment"}

The whole story is told from the point of view of an apathetic security unit who humorously refers to himself as \"murderbot\". He is a rebellious and lovable piece of equipment that has gone rogue and decided to make his own choices while at the same time diligently carrying out the job he is designated to do. His indifference to the rather thrilling events befalling everyone around him makes for a very funny but captivating and exciting read.

He secretly hacked his governor module so no one knows that he is self aware--and addicted to entertainment vids. He doesn't like humans, but he protects them, and he saves his team from sabotage, though none of them realize that immediately.\n\nThe characters are so well drawn that I couldn't stop turning the pages because it's a pleasure to watch them interact--and try to connect with their SecUnit as they come to know him, though not all of them trust him, and he prefers to keep his distance and his helmet on. But they have to work together to investigate another team's sudden silence--and survive.\n\nThis is one of those stories that you hate to see end. It is open-ended, btw, with a realistic ending.

Like many others I'm sure, I particularly enjoyed the narrator - an apathetic android who wishes humans would just leave it alone so it can watch entertainment feeds, before it gets drawn into a do-or-die situation. As someone who is very introverted and maybe just a little on the spectrum, I identified A LOT with Murderbot when it would say things like needing to watch entertainment feeds for a while to recharge after interacting with humans. Plus, as a genderless non-binary person, it was kind of a relief to read about a character without sex or gender. That's probably the first time I've read a book with an agender main character, so it was refreshing to see that, as well.\n\nThe book definitely coasted along on its strong and unique main character, though, cause the plot was quite a lot less strong. The plot seemed a bit too simple, and the action scenes seemed to largely consist of Murderbot getting knocked out and then getting carried away by the humans it was supposed to be protecting. The ending was clearly a set-up for further Murderbot adventures - not a bad thing, since I wouldn't mind spending more time with this character. Let's just see if more interesting things happen to it in later stories.\nfavorites\n \nsff\nLike\nComment"}

Funny mostly for the disinterested delivery, All Systems Red tells a pretty damn interesting tale that is lean on world building and better for it. A super quick read and lots of fun.

This is the same situation that always happens with any kind series, but here we are again. In this small novella (again, I am not so sure why this isn’t just the start of a novel that becomes published later, but novellas are big right now in genre fiction), we have a survey mission commissioned by a corporate entity on a foreign planet. The story is narrated through the consciousness of a “Murderbot” a cyborg security specialist enlisted by the corporation to guard over their interests in the mission. This consciousness has what is referred to as a hacked governor connected that is not hampering in the limitations of the programming. Also, there’s a kind of simple-minded or child-like personality embedded into the consciousness so that it finds interactions with the crew (who it neither trusts nor likes much) is a kind of awkward and annoying interaction and then it also loves consuming mass culture. But then, as you could have guessed, changes.\n\nThis most reminds me of the series of novels by Vanya Huff. Those novels, (The Valor series), are military fiction told tightly from the perspective of a low ranking but highly intelligent and competent sergeant, a cog in the machine. This too has that kind of controlled and competent narrative viewpoint. We are placed within this perspective and have gaps in our information that we have to work through on our own as reader. It’s generally pretty good, but not necessarily my most favorite kind of writing.\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2018-06-29", "text": "Laura\n442 reviews\n27 followers\nFollow\nJune 29, 2018\nI bought the second in the series as soon as I finished the first. It was that good. The sci-fi wasn’t overly heavy but it was a big part of the story. You didn’t feel confused or having to guess what it all meant, it was explained well when it was needed. Overly the story was just so good and simple to a point. A robot that wasn’t all robot. It wanted more, even if that more was just watching butt loads of tv shows and stuff on the entertainment feed.\n\nI liked how Murderbot wasn’t really a hero, it was just a robot doing what it wanted to do. Yes, it had to act a part but it helped because it liked them. It didn’t want to die but knew it could be repaired compared to its counterparts. Fear of pain was irrelevant. Fear of death wasn’t, it feared it. Which is what made Murderbot alive.\n\nThe shortness of the book added to the story, it made the Author focus on what needed to be focused on and ignore unnecessary fluff. Normally with shorter books, you feel like you’ve missed out on stuff, or more could have been added. Not in this case, the story just left you wanted to find out what Murderbot was going to do next.\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2021-12-23", "text": "Gillian\n102 reviews\n33 followers\nFollow\nMay 5, 2024\nThe sixth entry in the Murderbot Diaries is coming out soon, so what better way to prepare than rereading everything? I love Murderbot, let’s get that information out of the way. This is my third time rereading All Systems Red and it’s just as good as the first time I picked it up.\n\nI think this series has some of the best novellas being published in speculative fiction today. Martha Wells excels in writing non-human characters. Murderbot is funny narrator with a very dry wit that makes you laugh out loud while reading. I love a character that is very snarky and really doesn’t want to do the things they have to. And lets be real, if I was Murderbot, I too would only want to watch episodes of Sanctuary Moon rather than keeping idiots alive on an alien planet.\n\nOne of my favourite things about this novella is that nobody is a hero. Murderbot is only supposed to rescue clients from rogue fauna or teams turning on each other. They’re not prepared for outside human forces trying to kill their clients due to human politics. Likewise Dr. Mensah and the other members of the PreservationAux team are just scientists trying to do their jobs. They have no combat training and are way over their heads. It’s refreshing to read a story about characters that are not epic heros, they’re just ordinary people that wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time and have to use all their skills to persevere.\n\nThe Murderbot Diaries also does a really good and interesting job examining the question of what makes a person and the legalities of that status in various cultures. Murderbot isn’t human. They are not legally a person or a citizen. They’re property belonging to a corporation. But Murderbot has feelings, preferences, and thoughts outside their broken government module. And when things get bad, Murderbot makes hard decisions based on their desires and goals, rather than what the Company would consider the best option. It’s a very compelling and often heartwrenching examination of sentience, humanity, and personhood.\n2018\n \n2020\n \n2021\n \n...more\n4 likes\nLike\nComment"}

There was something about Murderbot that was relatable and oddly charming. I loved hearing their inner thoughts and antidotes. I was not expecting to ever read about an introverted robot who just want to be left alone to watch television, but I am so glad that I did! I found it to be fast-paced and I enjoyed the fact that there was an element of mystery throughout the story. The plot was fun, although not very original, and I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going on. There was also some interesting questions raised about what it means to be human, and about free will. I have come to realize that I enjoy novels that explore those topics. I did not particular care or not care for any of the side characters and maybe that was the whole point- the story is all about Murderbot! This book has made me want to find more books that are lighter SciFi, particularly involving robots. I have mixed feelings about the ending but I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series!\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}
