The tone and character voice make this series so easy to love, and it's the same as we see in her other work. As the series title suggests, this is about a Murderbot - what the manufacturers call a SecUnit - who has managed to reconfigure its own governor module though all it really does with the freedom is enjoy trashy television. Incredibly lethal, SecUnits quite rightly cause concern in those around them... and I mean, we've all been raised on fiction where robots decide it sounds like an excellent idea to 'kill all humans', so having one around for security who is armed to the teeth and perfectly calibrated for murder? Great!\n\nImagine how the humans would react if they found out that their security unit isn't under the control of its governance module, eh? \n\nWhat adds an interesting level of complexity is how human Murderbot looks, which is why it usually leaves the helmut opaque. What's also interesting is that it can feel pain and have emotions, and is mostly incredibly anxious around humans. It also carries quite a bit of distain for humans and yet also develops (or already has) quite high morals, and comes to react protectively of its humans without much time spent on the matter.\n\nAt only 144 pages so much happens in this novella. Pretty quickly the team Murderbot is hired to protect find themselves in far more danger than they bargained for. There are quite a few members in the team but Murderbot is so much more interesting than all of them, expect perhaps the leader of the expedition, Dr. Mensah, who becomes somewhat important for our protagonist. With so much packed in its hard to review without giving much away about the plot. I will say that the reason it hacked its governor module is what drives part of this novella, and all of the next. \n\nMurderbot is going to be a series of novellas, with another three expected to come out in 2018. \nfavourites\n \nread-2017\n \nread-2020\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person. Murderbot really does not like interacting with people and would rather be on her own. She really doesn't take her job seriously and is quite sarcastic. Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a short adventure, mystery on an unnamed planet.\n\nAs with all Wells novels this is a fast-paced well written story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The survey team comes under attack, people are killed, an unknown adversary. The story works as we get to learn more about our nonhuman protagonist. I really like this book and wish it was a full length novel. I am a huge fan of Martha Wells and can't wait to read more from this.\ne-books\n \nread-2017\n21 likes\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Who can resist that!\n\nAll planetary missions must be supplied by the Company and they must rent a Company supplied SecUnit, an android security guard. The narrator of All Systems Red is one such SecUnit, but it has hacked into the governor module and is now secretly autonomous. It refers to itself as Murderbot, and it really doesn’t care about it’s job — guarding a team of scientists on a remote planet where there shouldn’t be problems anyway. Murderbot much prefers to hack into a satellite and gain access to 35,000 hours of entertainment media. This works out perfectly fine for Murderbot until a neighboring mission goes dark and their own humans may be in danger.\n\nThe plot is not what’s important about All Systems Red. Instead, this science fiction novella focuses on the inner life of it’s protagonist and narrator, Murderbot. I know what you’re thinking: this is probably one of those robot stories where there’s a lot of angst and questioning about the nature of humanity. All Systems Red isn’t like that. There’s absolutely zero angst, and Murderbot finds humans awkward and slightly annoying. It says it likes fictional humans better than real humans, which is entirely relatable.\n\nMurderbot’s voice was far and away the best thing about All Systems Red. It’s hilarious! I was seriously laughing out loud while reading this. Robots with feelings are the best sort of robots, even if in this case our robot narrator is anti-social and largely apathetic. Although, Murderbot may be a bit less apathetic than it seems. While it professes to be horrified by the humans clumsy attempts to befriend it, it does seem to care about them beneath it all. As well as being astonishingly funny, it’s also quite heart warming.\n\nI loved All Systems Red so much. It will undoubtedly end up being one of the best science fiction stories I read all year. Thank goodness Martha Wells is writing a sequel! I desperately need more.\n\nOriginally posted on The Illustrated Page.\n2017-releases\n \nother-world\n \nscience-fiction\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Hence, Murderbot — although our Murderbot has disabled the system that they think caused them to do that, and manages to take pretty good care of its little group of prospectors while also mainlining a ton of soaps and whatever other entertainment programs come its way.\n\nI found it all very entertaining, but there was a more serious aspect, too: the Murderbot’s misanthropic attitude and even anxiety about interacting with humans, especially without its suit and opaque helmet on as a buffer. Thus the interactions with the team were a little sad as well as funny — if not sad, perhaps the right term would be invested with pathos, especially as they interact more and more with their employers (contractors? not sure quite what the term should be).\n\nI was a little disappointed by the ending, leaving behind the established team. Obviously there’s gonna be more Murderbot, but… with a new cast otherwise? Boo. I was just getting to like ’em.\n\nReviewed for The Bibliophibian.\nrobots\n \nshort-stories-novellas\n \nspeculative-fiction\n15 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

It's starts slow as it introduces you to the players and the game, even the tech is revealed relatively slowly and in small quantities, with no big info dumps.\n\nMurderbot is interesting. Is it a cyborg? These SecUnits are part machine, part organic parts derived from cloning, but obviously with personalities and thoughts of their own. This is proved by the fact that they don't just run on programming, but that their own impulses and actions have to be controlled or curbed by the governor module.\n\nIt's like a more versatile, upgraded, slightly less squicky version of Halva from The Ship Who Sang. Though being grown in a test tube probably isn't wonderful, I think it's a little better than being a stunted human body encased in a metal column implanted in a spaceship.\n\nWhere does one's humanity stop or start? Human, cyborg, self aware synthetic being?\n\nThis was fun, Murderbot had their own thoughts and plans and wants, and entertainment obsessions and anxieties and I'd enjoy reading more. Case in point, naming itself Murderbot.\n\nPS I also love that Murderbot is never prescribed a gender, seeing as they have no genitalia, and are free of gender constraints.\ndystopia\n \nscience-fiction\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

I'm really glad I did because I didn't remember anything.\n_____\n\nAll Systems Red is a story about a team surveying a new planet told from the perspective of a security robot.\n\nMurderbot's perspective is a lot of fun. The robot is a hacked version of what it's supposed to be, so instead of being focused on the contract/clients, it's more focused on watching television shows. It's sassy and has as carefree an attitude as a robot can have.\nThe other characters served their purpose in the story. They filled the reader in on world building information and gave Murderbot a contract/purpose. Other than that, they were just sort of there. This is usually a negative, however for the purpose of this story it works and allows the focus to be placed on Murderbot.\n\nThe exploration of a new planet is one of my all time favourite science fiction plot lines. The exploration in this story was decent. The \"mystery\" is satisfactory, however I would have liked to discover more information, but that wasn't the purpose of the story. The focus of the story is on Murderbot as a \"person\" rather than what's going on around it.\n\n\nOverall, All Systems Red was a unique novella that sets up future stories that I will be definitely checking out.

{"username": "", "date": "2019-reads", "text": "Liz (Quirky Cat)\n4,977 reviews\n84 followers\nFollow\nAugust 31, 2023\nAll Systems Red is about an android (partially synthetic, partially organic) that is charged with protecting a scientific team on a new and relatively unknown planet. Having no name of its own, it names itself Murderbot, which makes sense in a weird sort of way. It took me less than two hours to read, so it doesn't require much time investment (Though I would have loved for it to be longer).\n\nMurderbot is different from all the other SecUnits. It figured out how to hack its way to freedom. Now, he doesn't have to follow orders or install updates automatically. Instead, it can watch all the crummy TV he wants. It pretends to do everything it was programmed to do so nobody catches on, but it isn't required.\n\nHuman interaction is awkward for Murderbot. It knows it's not one of them, and they know that, making it difficult for MurderBot to move past it. Despite this, MurderBot grows truly attached to certain crew members it's protecting. Everything about the interactions it has is oddly...human. It's endearing.\n\nMy description here has barely scratched the surface of all that makes MurderBot so amazing; please trust me on this! I have read (and listened) to this whole series at least a dozen times at this point...realistically that count is a whole lot higher. \n\nIt is safe to say that MurderBot has stolen my heart. The characters and the series live rent-free in my mind. In fact, it recently occurred to me that MurderBot is to me what Sanctuary Moon is to MurderBot. That gave me a good chuckle. Enjoy!\n\nHighlights:\nCyberpunk meets Solarpunk\nRogue Android/SecUnit\nSarcastic Characters\nSpace Adventures\n\nGraphic Audio Review:\n\nIn case you haven't heard the news, Graphic Audio recently released their production of All Systems Red, the first novella in the MurderBot Diaries series (one of my favorite series of all time). Naturally, I pre-ordered the shit out of that. Since its release, I've listened to it three times. Yes, I know.\nAt first, listening to the Graphic Audio version of All Systems Red was strange. I'm used to hearing Kevin R. Free's voice, especially for MurderBot. This made me think I didn't like it, or at least I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.\n\nThen I listened to it again. It works; it really does! David Cui Cui portrays MurderBot in a slightly different manner than Kevin R. Free. The sarcasm is less of a constant presence. However! His voice helps to highlight other elements of MurderBot's character (such as their more atypical nature).\n\nSpeaking of casting and characters, I think the voice for Ratthi (Zeke Alton) is my favorite. Mensah's voice (Khaya Fraites) sounded a little younger than I expected, but otherwise, I don't have any complaints.\n\nIf you're on the fence about trying All Systems Red by Graphic Audio, I would highly suggest trying it. It's a fun listen!\n\nYou Can Also Find Me On:\nQuirky Cat's Fat Stacks | Quirky Cat's Comics | The Book Review Crew | Monkeys Fighting Robots | Storygraph | Bookhype | Bookstagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Reedsy\n2017-reads\n \n2018-reads\n \n2019-reads\n \n...more\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Review cross-posted to my blog here: http://www.firstsightsecondthoughts.n...All Systems Red is the first novella in the Murderbot Diaries series, which is a name that is just full of yes. I was a little disappointed when I found out that this was a novella and not a full length novel, but I’m trying to make a mental adjustment there. Rather than wishing there was more, I’d like to try to appreciate that the writer wrote the story to the length it should be, rather than padding it out to make it novel-length when the plot for it isn’t there.Murderbot, the protagonist of the story, is a programmed cyborg Security Unit who has figured out how to override his own governor module and can ignore his orders. He’s accompanying a survey team on a distant planet, as a safety precaution mandated by the Company that arranges the surveys. Of course, he’d much rather sit around and watch entertainment programs all day instead of actually go out and fight off the enormous worm creatures that seem to be a bit of a surprise in this region. Over the course of the story, Murderbot and the crew get signs that all is not quite as it seems.So, I mean, I am all about stories where robots learn how to feel emotions and how to love. Apparently I am also all about stories where socially anxious robots learn how to tolerate and eventually care about their human crew. As soon as Murderbot identifies them as “his humans”, it’s all over for me. The “reluctant hero” doesn’t typically do it for me, but when it’s a robot who just wants to watch his goddamn anime sitcom shit, apparently I am all in. I love Murderbot. Murderbot is delightful and relatable and fun. …And just the fact that he calls himself Murderbot makes everything so much better.All of the individual facets of the plot and setting and characters here are things I tend to like – even beyond Murderbot’s character growth. Space intrigue, gross alien monsters, dodgy unethical mega-conglomerate companies, a crew of found family who are super competent at their jobs. These are all very solid, and they’re very well handled within this story. I haven’t read anything else by Wells, but this is clearly not her first rodeo, and I’m definitely interested to see what else she’s written.The big synopsis for this novella I tend to see describes it as Westworld meets the Culture books by Iain M Banks. I haven’t read those, but I think it’s also reasonable to say that it feels a little like Westworld meets Dune, except the people here don’t hate each other as much as they hate each other in Dune. I mean, you know, desert world sand worms. There’s gonna be a Dune comparison. And also robots awakening to sentience, there’s gonna be a Westworld comparison, at least here in 2017 – god knows Westworld is not the first or last to do it and do it well.This book has a great balance of seriousness and humor as well. I think it’s easy (well, for a given value of easy) to do one or the other, but striking the proper balance is tricky, and I very much appreciate books that manage it. The tension and drama surrounding the Company and the rogue SecUnits, and the discovery of Murderbot’s sentience is always met with the perfectly timed snarky remark from Murderbot, or a quip about his favorite serial drama, or something along those lines. It’s like if Marvin the Paranoid Android from H2G2 was not clinically depressed, and just super socially awkward.The human characters are great too, as are Murderbot’s frank assessments of their personalities and relationships. Seeing through Murderbot’s eyes gives a great introduction to them, as we see them being the first crew he’s actually given a damn about, and why. I don’t know if any of them would be particularly interesting as viewpoint characters themselves, but they make fascinating subjects from our secondhand standpoint through Murderbot’s perspective. Given how this first installment ends, I’ll be really interested to see who he meets in the next book and what he thinks of them.And I am so happy that “Murderbot Diaries #1” means that there will be more. Wells has said as much on her social media, and it seems like this is selling/rating well, so I don’t know why there wouldn’t be more. I don’t know how much more, but I am definitely excited for more Murderbot. I want to follow his journey as he learns how to feel, to think, to figure out who he is, and possibly… how to love, the most important robot story of all.", "text": "Jennifer\n79 reviews\n29 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 3, 2017\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\nShow full review\nLike\nComment"}

Yes, it's a construct, and it's agender and ace because that's how it (they?) was constructed, but it's definitely a person, and the gender thing and the aceness aren't there to suggest that it's something that makes it/them less human, or to mark the Otherness.\n\nOf course, all that isn't particularly relevant to the plot, apart from when Murderbot fast forwards through sex scenes in TV shows episodes because they're boring. Most of the time Murderbot is engulfed in a) exasperation, b) social anxiety caused by the inherent awkwardness of interacting with members of the expedition, or c) the profound need to be left in peace to watch TV shows. VERY RELATABLE. Also, solving the mystery and keeping everyone alive.\n\nI was just informed that the next book in the series is in the making and it makes me very, very happy.\nhumour\n \nsf-cyberpunk\n5 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

But now the research group he's in charge of protecting starts having trouble at first it seems like information may have just been left out but they soon realize it was sabotage and the planet they are researching on has Secrets another group doesn't want anyone finding out then when murderbot gets hacked and is commanded to kill his humans he resists since he has no governor. And does not have to follow commands, soon the group learns of this and they do not know if he's actually on their side or not. But once he starts killing other Bots to protect them they realize he's trying to protect them and that's how things play out in this short story not bad but not great I can say I did not like the ending but that was just my opinion.\n2017\n \nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-06-03", "text": "April\n964 reviews\n9 followers\nFollow\nJune 3, 2017\nThis is a lovely gem of a novella. I read it and then reread it again immediately, just so I could continue to be with the very compelling main character, who has a wonderfully intriguing viewpoint. Our SecUnit (a kind of cyborg clone) is in the middle of a boring planetary survey with its clients, about whom it knows nothing. Why should it? To them, it is just equipment the survey company requires them to bring along to increase its profit and cut costs. In just 150 short easy pages, I grew to care a lot about this bot. It loves watching entertainment videos, saying, \"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\" (p.9) Starting with its override of a automatic command not to save one of the humans from being eaten by a local monster, the bot gradually gets drawn in to protecting \"my humans.\" The mystery is why the humans are being targeted, and one of the things I love about this book is that the answer doesn't fit your standard planetary expedition adventure. Another reason to love this book is that Wells is a master at expressing the feelings of an outsider who is so lonely they don't even want to try to join humanity. That sounds depressing, but this bot is great! Favorite quotes: \"So, I'm awkward with actual humans....I know I'm a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous.\" (p.20) \" \"I got my helmet on and opaqued it. The relief was intense....'I love you armour, and I'm never leaving you again.'\" (p.95) From start to the finish, which was again non-standard (thank you, Wells!), I loved this adventure and the characters.

Watching the outcast lead character win the approval and acceptance of his companions, only to prove that he is still an outcast by nature is oddly satisfying.

Most tales about sentient cyborgs/robots seem to assume that, given the chance, they'll go rogue and kill everyone. Not Murderbot. All he wants to do is watch his downloaded vids of TV shows. Humans are a nuisance, as they keep doing stupid things and have to be saved. The main storyline is a good action/adventure tale of a planetary expedition running afoul of a rival corporation wanting to kill all the other teams wanting to develop the planet.

Apparently someone has hacked the information databases about the new planet they're surveying and left out some pretty vital info. Who did this? Why? And how do they not die while trying to answer those questions? That's the main through plot and it's well done.

Wells seemed careful to stay away from gender markers, but somehow I read Murderbot as female.\n\nA male reader was selected for the audiobook, howsomever, and he does well enough. 11/23\nsf-fantasy\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-07-09", "text": "Scotoma\n47 reviews\n1 follower\nFollow\nJuly 9, 2025\nThis is one of the best science fiction pieces I read last year (I read it when it came out and re-read just recently) and while I haven’t read much science fiction recently overall, I still would think it would have been among the strongest pieces overall. It’s a novella, a couple of pages shy of a 100 pages, and yet it feels packed with content.\n\nEverything is told from the viewpoint of Murderbot, a robot, or android would be the better description, that has been hired out by her company to work as a bodyguard to keep a group of scientists safe on a mission to a new world, and then things go south very fast. What helps our intrepid murderbot is that it has hacked its own control module and is fully in control of itself, which is not how things should be.\n\nOn a past mission, as far as it knows, it went rogue, killed lots of people it was supposed to keep safe, then its memory was purged and the murderbot repurposed. After all, it’s not a being, but a piece of equipment to most people in this corporate future (only a few enclaves treat SecBots like their own being, and even they require guardians, which in the words of Murderbot, is a nicer word for owner).\n\nI say it since Murderbot doesn’t have any gender or sex, although to me Murderbot feels more like a her than a he (which might be due to being written by a woman and I automatically assigned her gender to that of Murderbot, even If I shouldn’t have). That said, the way Murderbot is written, it has aspects that intentionally make it hard to pinpoint as either gender, which I think is a really neat trick, as it makes sure you’re always aware just how much it is different from humans.\n\nAnd yet, Wells managed to infuse Murderbot with so much humanity in the few pages we have, that its hard not to empathize with her. It just wants to do its job, not getting into the confusing social aspects of a tightly-knit group of human explorers or it’s own feelings over its own humanity. Murderbot knows exactly what and what it isn’t, and doesn’t want to think too much about these things and instead prefers to binge-watch hours upon hours of TV serials like the most ardent Netflix-addict.\n\nThis obviously doesn’t work out when an ‘evil’, hidden surveyor group tries to kill Murderbot’s charges and it has to bring all it has to bear to survive and keep it’s people alive. And this makes it clear to it at the end, that hiding from its own humanity is something it can’t do anymore because humans are all around, but that it doesn’t want to be controlled by anybody, not even those it considers friends.\n\nWhat makes this work so well is the combined mix of an action-packed survival story, the mystery of the evil surveyor group and how fast the threat gets ramped-up from random glitches to murderous intent and the seamlessly integrated exploration of a believable android trying to grapple with its own existence. After nearly a 100 years of stories on androids and robots, I would have thought this topic would have been mined until nothing is left to do, but to be honest, this novella just showed me there’s so much more and we have hardly begun to explore thinking about this deep enough. But this will suffice for now.\nprose\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Novellas can be a tricky thing. They’re not full length books, but they can sometimes still demand the same price. All Systems Red comes in at just 150 pages, so it’s a quick read, but despite the length of the book, the true importance is the impact of the story. That’s where this one shines. All Systems Red stands out. The style and narrative of the story, the voice of the main character, it grips you right from the start and compels you to keep going. There’s humor, there’s action and there’s mystery as this sci-fi tale pokes it’s head into the waters of a very interesting universe. It’s one where hi-tech gadgets are curbed by businesses cutting corners to save costs. A place where planetary explorers get in over the heads with vicious lifeforms and deadly technology. But most of all, it’s a story about a murderbot who just wants to watch tv.\n\n“I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.” And so the book begins with the main character. A robot. A murderbot. Murderbot doesn’t have a name. It’s official designation is simply SecUnit, short for security unit, and it’s tasked with the security of a scientific team on a far off planet. Murderbot is just one cog in the wheel of futuristic commerce. Corporations sell out shares of prospect worlds to parties interested, who in turn rent or buy all the equipment needed to explore that world, which includes security units like Murderbot. Part machine and part cloned human, Murderbot has no gender and, theoretically, no freedom. However, thanks to a hacked governor module, Muderbot has quite a lot of freedom. In most stories, that freedom would lead to a robot killing its masters to seek its freedom. In this story, Murderbot ends up travelling a very different path, which is what makes it fun.\n\nNow I don’t want to spoil the story, so suffice to say Murderbot goes on an adventure on this alien world with a team of scientists and it leads to plenty of action and mystery. Yet the key that glues it all together is the humor. Murderbot’s peculiar personality leads to some very fun quirks that makes the story so enjoyable. Murderbot knows it’s a piece of junk made by a corporation using the cheapest parts to maximize profits. This in turns leads to some self-deprecating humor. On the other hand, you have this extremely advanced machine in comparison to what we actually have in reality. Murderbot has a true artificial intelligence and is capable of making its own decisions and having its own wants and desires. So what does an AI do? It watches tv. That right there is hilarious.\n\nWhile novellas can be a hard sell, All Systems Red is a must read story. Seriously, this is a sci-fi story you should check out. It’s fun, unique, quirky, and a pure joy to read. This story in itself is rather self-contained, however there is another book on the way.

{"username": "", "date": "Martha Wells’ All Systems Red won me over almost immediately. I began the first page with reservations and by page three I was charmed into complete immersion.\n\nI’m not kidding when I say I read this book in almost one sitting. I was so comfortable in this book, so reluctant to surface from my reading bubble, at one point I tried to get my cat to flip the light switch for me – the sun had gone down and I couldn’t keep reading without the light, but I didn’t want to stop even for a minute. That said, this is absolutely an easy “one sitting” read.\n\nThe characters are full and entertaining, the central concept as clearly brought to life as is the world Wells has created. Honestly, I cannot believe how much emotion and life Martha Wells effortlessly fit into 150 pages. I’ve referred before to authors whose “magic” lies in this accomplishment or that skill, and to me this is Wells’ skill: she puts not only a fully realized narrative and cast of characters in a tiny package, but creates what feels like a living, breathing world and narrative arcs readers will invest in into a travel sized snack of a book!\n\nOne of the things I watch out for as I’m reading is how quickly I can get “into” a new book. This is partly down to author’s style and voice, and partly down to how quickly the author introduces me to the characters, the story, and the universe. I fell into All Systems Red effortlessly.

I began the first page with reservations and by page three I was charmed into complete immersion.\n\nI’m not kidding when I say I read this book in almost one sitting. I was so comfortable in this book, so reluctant to surface from my reading bubble, at one point I tried to get my cat to flip the light switch for me – the sun had gone down and I couldn’t keep reading without the light, but I didn’t want to stop even for a minute. That said, this is absolutely an easy “one sitting” read.\n\nThe characters are full and entertaining, the central concept as clearly brought to life as is the world Wells has created. Honestly, I cannot believe how much emotion and life Martha Wells effortlessly fit into 150 pages. I’ve referred before to authors whose “magic” lies in this accomplishment or that skill, and to me this is Wells’ skill: she puts not only a fully realized narrative and cast of characters in a tiny package, but creates what feels like a living, breathing world and narrative arcs readers will invest in into a travel sized snack of a book!\n\nOne of the things I watch out for as I’m reading is how quickly I can get “into” a new book. This is partly down to author’s style and voice, and partly down to how quickly the author introduces me to the characters, the story, and the universe. I fell into All Systems Red effortlessly. I was not only hooked, but fully invested in the characters and completely oriented and acclimatized in the universe before I had time to realize what was happening to me.\n\nAll in all, Martha Wells put together a romp of a tale in All Systems Red, and I cannot wait to read more.

But mostly, I liked the main character--\"Murderbot.\" Unlike many recent AI books and movies, this sentient machine/cyborg isn't seeking selfhood and independence for some grand ambitions, but rather out of a surly anti-authoritarianism and boredom. Mostly, Murderbot wants to be left alone to watch its store of entertainment media, and when it has to interact with humans, it's with the greatest sarcasm:\n\n\"Confession time: I don't actually know where we are... I hadn't looked at the maps yet and I'd barely looked at the survey package... The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\" (p. 35)\n\nI definitely want to spend more time with Murderbot, which is good, as I just read that several more books are forthcoming in this series.\n2023\n \naudiobook\n \nsci-fi\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The resolution is classic Niven or Heinlein or Pohl or even Hammett, using clues given in the body of the story.\n\nThe best term I can think of for this book is \"cute.\" And it is, in an extreme sort of way, if one can view violent dismemberment and organic punctures as the willingness to be lovable. But there it is, Murderbot qualifies as both cute and lovable.\n\nComparing this with another non-human bot in Ancillary Justice, I prefer cute to stolid. There is enough here to want to read the next book in the series. 4.25 stars.\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

However, when things start to go sour on the survey it is on, the team that it is supposed to be protecting figures out that it's more person than robot, and now poor Murderbot has to contend with people being concerned about its feelings...

In distant, spare faring future, where corporate super entities rule most of space, Murderbot is a security unit, or SecUnit for short, for one of the corporate-politico entities that equip smaller entities with all the equipment they'd need for an exploratory mission - for a price, of course. On one such mission, Murderbot is attempting to catch up on Sanctuary Moon, their favourite serial, when a neighbouring mission goes dark - and they could be next! Full of danger, fights, world building and Murderbot's snarky tone.

Lindström\nAuthor \n1 book\n13 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 14, 2022\nMurderbot is a rogue SecUnit, a rent-a-bot that's ~50% machine and ~50% organic matter. It could basically pass for a human with technical modifications. Murderbot is rogue in that it's hacked the module that sends it orders, so that it doesn't have to follow those orders if it doesn't want to. This means it can spend most of its missions ignoring all the boring stuff and catching up on soaps. Sadly, the current mission looks to be turning into a complicated one. Will Murderbot find enough peace and quite to catch up on its stories? Stay tuned to find out!\n\nAs a main character, Murderbot has pros and cons. I like how detached it was, while at the same time got a little bored myself with some moments because Murderbot wasn't too invested in them. I hardly remember which of the human characters was which (with one exception) because Murderbot wasn't too interested in them as people (with one exception). That said, the mystery drove the plot forward and there weren't any \"unnecessary\" scenes. Really liked Murderbot as a character! Now that it has been established as a personality, I think its next adventure will be even more interesting than its first. Also, that the whole book was written as a transmission that Murderbot is sending out thankfully paid off at the end. Will be picking up the next book in the series.\nauthors-i-follow\n \nmystery\n \nscience-fiction\nLike\nComment"}

The narrator, who calls itself \"Murderbot,\" is a fantastic character, which is ironic since it's supposed to be a soulless robot. This is a very funny (but not in a slapstick sort of way) and very well-written piece of science fiction, with a lot of action and great, well-drawn characters.

I wanted to explore some anomalies I’d noticed through the feed.” He gestured to me. “This unit was already a rogue. It has a hacked governor module.”\n\nOn the entertainment feed, this is what they call an “oh shit” moment.\n\nThrough the security cams, I watched them be confused, but not alarmed, not yet.\n\nPin-Lee, who had apparently just been digging around in my local system, folded her arms. Her expression was sharp and skeptical. “I find that difficult to believe.” She didn’t add “you asshole” but it was in her voice. She didn’t like anybody questioning her expertise.\n\n“It doesn’t have to follow our commands; there is no control over its behavior,” Gurathin said, getting impatient. He didn’t like anybody questioning his expertise either, but he didn’t show it like Pin-Lee did. “I showed Volescu my evaluations and he agrees with me.”\n\nI had a moment to feel betrayed, which was stupid. Volescu was my client, and I’d saved his life because that was my job, not because I liked him. But then Volescu said, “I don’t agree with you.”\n\n“The governor module is working, then?” Mensah asked, frowning at all of them.\n\n“No, it’s definitely hacked,” Volescu explained. When he wasn’t being attacked by giant fauna, he was a pretty calm guy. “The governor’s connection to the rest of the SecUnit’s system is partially severed. It can transmit commands, but can’t enforce them or control behavior or apply punishment. But I think the fact that the Unit has been acting to preserve our lives, to take care of us, while it was a free agent, gives us even more reason to trust it.”\n\nOkay, so I did like him.\n\nGurathin insisted, “We’ve been sabotaged since we got here. The missing hazard report, the missing map sections. The SecUnit must be part of that. It’s acting for the company, they don’t want this planet surveyed for whatever reason. This is what must have happened to DeltFall.”\n\nRatthi had been waiting for a moment to lunge in and interrupt. “Something odd is definitely going on. There were only three SecUnits for DeltFall in their specs, but there were five units in their habitat. Someone is sabotaging us, but I don’t think our SecUnit is part of it.”\n\nWith finality, Bharadwaj said, “Volescu and Ratthi are right. If the company did order the SecUnit to kill us, we would all be dead.”\n\nOverse sounded mad. “It told us about the combat module, it told us to kill it. Why the hell would it do that if it wanted to hurt us?”\n\nI liked her, too. And even though being part of this conversation was the last thing I wanted to do, it was time to speak for myself.\n\nI kept my eyes closed, watching them through the security camera, because that was easier. I made myself say, “The company isn’t trying to kill you.”\n\nThat startled them. Gurathin started to speak, and Pin-Lee shushed him. Mensah stepped forward, watching me with a worried expression. She was standing near me, with Gurathin and the others gathered in a loose circle around her. Bharadwaj was farthest back, sitting in a chair. Mensah said, “SecUnit, how do you know that?”\n\nEven through the camera, this was hard. I tried to pretend I was back in my cubicle. “Because if the company wanted to sabotage you, they would have poisoned your supplies using the recycling systems. The company is more likely to kill you by accident.”\n\nThere was a moment while they all thought about how easy it would have been for the company to sabotage its own environmental settings. Ratthi began, “But surely that would—”\n\nGurathin’s expression was stiffer than usual. “This Unit has killed people before, people it was charged with protecting. It killed fifty-seven members of a mining operation.”\n\nWhat I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.\n\n\n3 1/2 stars\naction\n \ncrime\n \nhumor\n \n...more\n26 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

This Vantablack comedy crosses the ethos of 'Star Trek' with contemporary corporate culture which results in some hilarious deadpan comedy. If 'Not giving a shit' was an Olympic event then 'Murderbot', the central character, would be guaranteed a podium finish if not the Gold Medal. The author uses this to great effect, many details about the setting are kept from the reader simply because Murderbot could never be bothered reading the relevant files. Despite this the story hangs together and avoids descending into silliness - the characters act in a sensible manner throughout the story. At a mere 144 pages this is a rather slim volume but it means there is no padding. If you like your stories tight and humour dark this book is definitely for you.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-07-18", "text": "Matt\n135 reviews\n4 followers\nFollow\nJuly 18, 2017\nFirst the Good: This book is about a security robot who calls himself \"Murderbot\" has managed to hack his governor module that compels him to follow orders and his programming. While this in itself is not unique, the hook is Murderbot now has free will, but he (or her since it has not sex) is still a bot, so it has to decide how to interact with people, not somehting it has much experience in.\nThis has resulted in it being an introvert and extremely awkward around humans. Think of it as a highly weaponized, murdering, rogue robot with a touch of autism, that also loves soap operas, but with a heart of gold. What I also, appreciated is the book doesn't go into a whole origin story narrative about how it managed to hack it's governor and \"awaken\", etc. We've seen that before in other books.\n\nNow the Bad: Mostly it comes down to the book is thin; in many ways. First, even calling it a \"book\" is not really accurate. At under 150 pages it's really a novella at best, or even a short story. Admittedly, the author's Goodreads page describes it a such but I didn't notice. Because of this it's thin in other ways too such as character development, world building, even an interesting plot. The whole thing seemed rushed and glossed over somehow. Even the generic title \"All Systems Red\" sounds like it was just made up at the last minute. In the end I felt like I was shown a pretty cool concept, but was cheated out of an experience. It does appear to be the first book in a series and the main character certainly has potential. If the next in the series has more meat to it I would give it a chance.\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

(Murderbot is not really an android, but that comes closest to what they are.)\n\nI've been reading a lot of horror and dark fiction lately, completely on purpose, but I realized I needed a bit of a break. Enter Murderbot. This series has gotten tons of good press in the sci-fi world, and if you read that stuff you have probably heard of it. If you have not, here's the elevator pitch. A security android (sorta) hacks itself so as to no longer be under the control of the company that owns it. Instead of waging war on those who have done it wrong, it decides to continue doing its job, at least half-assedly, and watch a bunch of shows. This is going pretty well, until the group it's contracted to provided security for is sabotaged and Murderbot has to save them. While doing this, it discovers it kinda likes these particular humans, and would like them to not die.\n\nThe best thing about this re-read, for me, is comparing this Murderbot with the Murderbot of later books. Murderbot remains anxious and grouchy, but it's so, so much worse in this book. Murderbot is still used to hiding behind an opaque helmet, so having to talk to people face to face is deeply uncomfortable for it. At one point, it has to go face the wall to have a conversation. Another thing that's great is watching Murderbot improve at its job. It's a security expert, but it says many times that the company only cares about its clients to the extent that it would have to pay insurance on them. The company is also incredibly cheap, and Murderbot often comes up with ideas based more on the shows it watches than the actual training it has had downloaded to it. (Also, I hope no one finds me calling Murderbot 'it' upsetting. Murderbot has no gender or sexual orientation, and, at least at this point, doesn't really think of itself as a person. There's probably a good case to made for using 'they' pronouns for Murderbot, but I don't think that actually happens in the story. The story is in first person, and most people that Murderbot meets either believe it to be a thing, or they call it some alias it has picked.)\n\nAnyway, read these books, y'all. They're fun, smart, and Murderbot is a wonderful mess of neuroses trying to find its place, and time to watch its shows, in a world that's mostly afraid of it.\naliens-and-outerspace\n \ncrime-and-thriller\n \nfuturism\n \n...more\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot's such a fun, and--yeah--relatable character. I'm looking forward to continuing on with the rest of the novellas in this series.\n\n(My mini-review from the first read is below the *.)\n\n*\n\nThe cyborg protagonist of \"All Systems Red\" is hired on, or rented, to act as security for a small survey team exploring a new planet. The autopilot on the team's transport is sabotaged while they are exploring an anomaly on the survey map, leading to an investigation into who might have done it, and why.\n\n\"Murderbot\" reminds me somewhat of Breq in the Imperial Radch trilogy, especially in how its interactions with humans, and its variance from others of its kind, open up questions of what \"identity\" means. Its lackadaisical attention to detail, its frequent criticisms of how cheap the company that created it is, and its awkwardness with the crew, made this story surprisingly charming and funny.\n\nThe ending was perfect for a novella, closing off this chapter for Murderbot, and making me anxious to see where it goes to next.\n\nThis was my second Martha Wells (the other was City of Bones quite a while ago), and I'm glad there are plenty more yet to read.

They are controlled by governor chips that limit them and reign them in.\n\nSecBots don't care much for Humans and most Humans don't have much time for SecBots. The SecBot in All Systems Red doesn't like them much either. Not so much hate, more apathetic disdain, it has also managed to hack it's own governor chip. A fact it hasn't seen fit to mention to any Humans. The only thing stopping our SecBot (Who calls itself MurderBot!) from doing whatever it likes (Mostly binge watching Sanctuary Moon on a future equivalent of Netflix) is having to pretend it's still a slave to the man.\n\nThat's pretty much where this novella starts - and all I want to say about the story is that It is awesome. My only criticism is that it's not long enough! I need more MurderBot in my life!\n\nIf I was an artificial construct - I would be just like Murderbot! ... Maybe. ;)\n\n2018-hugo-reading-list\nLike\nComment"}

It almost felt as if this was supposed to be a short story or started as a short story, and the treatment ended up getting expanded beyond its initial premise.

A broken one, in fact. Or as it likes to call itself, A Murderbot. This is a fast read. And the author, who has built fantasy worlds like no others before, takes you to another planet, to a survey team, where conspiracy threatens the lives of the humans Murderbot finds itself caring about.

The narrator, the self-named (but never outloud) \"Murderbot\", is a self-aware security android which has secretly freed itself from human control, and helps to protect these humans until it can get off the planet.\n\nWhy did I read it?\nSo many people recommended it on twitter. So many.\n\nFavourite idea/part?\nMurderbot's personality. Its obsessive love of entertainment programming. Its reluctant love of certain humans. Its snark and cleverness. Oh yeah, and its immense desire to just be left alone so it can finally watch it's shows.\n\nOverall:\nI'm so happy I found this. It's only a short read, (2 hours maybe) but well worth your time. The plot is fast-moving and interesting, while the characters are diverse and capable and worth paying attention to.

This was a subject that could have been done in many different tones, and the author forewent slapstick comedy or scifi-noir for a more straight treatment that asked many interesting questions and had a fair bit to say on scifi's old \"how do we treat The Other?\" trope. The main character's grumpy and introverted internal monologue was fun to listen to, and you rooted for it through the whole thing, as it evolved and changed and began to have Opinions that it couldn't just hide while it pretended to be a good little nonsentient. The worldbuilding was secondary to the character's arc, but was still well-done. The tension was well-played and kept me reading through the whole thing, and I was not expecting the very fitting denouement - the murderbot refused to conform to the genre's expectations right to the end, and for that I applaud it.\nowned-ebook\n \nsci-fi\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Po ugovoru, grupici je dodijeljen ne pretjerano naoružan robot-čuvar SecUnit, ali ovaj je opičen po tome jer je 'po skrivečki' hakirao svoj upravljački modul tako da može biti neovisan o zakrpama i raznim downloadima koje mu centralni sustav šalje jer želi više vremena za sebe, istražiti što želi i slično. Osim toga, hakirao je satelit tako da može skidati, pohraniti i gledati mnoštvo tv serija i filmova u samoći jer više voli fiktivne likove nego stvarna ljudska bića.\n\n\"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As an heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\"\n\nRobot naziva sebe Murderbotom, jer je negdje u prošlosti imao glitch u svom upravljačkom modulu i nenamjerno posmicao jedan drugi istraživački tim. Neke njegove scene s interakcijom s ljudima su zbilja smiješne, poput onih kad mu je neugodno gledati čovjeka u oči za vrijeme razgovora pa si prebaci svoj pogled na kamere sa stropa i otud nastavlja promatrati razgovor. Zatim, prije samog zadatka koji imaju na planeti, robot si je trebao skinuti i pročitati sve podatke o svakom članu ekspedicije, a on je to sve fino pohranio nekamo drugamo jer u svojoj memoriji više nije imao dovoljno slobodnog mjesta radi svih skinutih filmova i serija. A kad mu je zbilja neugodno ili kad ga zadirkuju, onda se okrene prema kutu i stoji kao osnovnoškolac.\n\n'Shit hits the fan' kada naša ekipa sazna da je još jedna istraživačka ekipa na planeti nestala i netko im počinje hakirati sigurnosne podatke, ukratko - netko ih želi mrtve. Tempo je odličan i polako se otkrivaju nove stvari vezane za nalaze sa planeta i pozadina čudnih događaja, a na našim junacima je da otkriju tko stoji iza toga i zašto.\n\nPoglavito na Murderbotu, koji se samo želi opet natrag vratiti 'binge-watchingu' tona i tona premuim tv sadržaja, baš kao i ja.\n18 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Some planets are controlled by political or cultural systems, some owned by corporations, and some in between. One such planet is being surveyed by possible colonizers from several backgrounds when things go awry - one survey group is wiped out and another attacked. Turns out humanity also brought crime with it to space! Most of the story is about one survivor, and human-robot hybrid security clone who has gone rogue prior to the story and just wants to be free enough to watch her serials. Pretending to be still under the control of her owners, she's in control of security in what should have been a fairly cushy assignment to guard a well-meaning and peaceful team from a politically liberal planet. Then things start to happen. Charming character in a plausible future; here's hoping for more diary entries.\nread-sci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

It's not done in a relatable way at all. \"Omg they hate me because I'm a robot\". It's just said over and over again that the main character feels awkward around humans.\n\nLater on the story points out that since the main character is a robot it has no gender and doesn't care about sex. Again there's a whole paragraph on this and it doesn't feel naturally integrated into the story at all. \"Look I'm trying to be diverse\". Yeah it's a robot of course it doesn't have to have a gender. Another thing is that the main character reads actually like a girl so this whole gender neutral thing is not working out.

I mean, it just wants to be left alone and not have to deal with humans so it can watch its favorite TV shows! I can relate. But really, this was just fun. I loved the dynamic between Murderbot and its shipmates and how they didn't really know how to act around it but wanted to take its feelings into consideration, and all the awkward conversations were so much fun. I also loved seeing how Murderbot would deny caring about any of the people but then demonstrate through its actions that these people clearly did matter to it on some level at least.

Once he had hacked his governor chip and gained self-determination, he decided that, all things considered, he’d rather watch TV than murder. But to maintain a network connection to the entertainment feeds, not to mention avoid an inevitable decommissioning and disassembly, he has to continue diligently performing the banal duties of a bargain basement corporate security droid.\n\nSkynet meets The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit.\n\nMurderbot doesn’t really care about his job, or the Company that owns him, or the humans entrusted to his care. He is potentially capable of greatness, certainly of great evil, but he hasn’t figured out who he is yet or why he should even bother. In this, Murderbot is every 20-something working a boring job.\n\nSure, “sentient AI gains autonomy and embarks on a journey of self-discovery” is totally a trope by now, but All Systems Red is the highest quality trope. It is fated to be eternally anthologized as a sterling example of its sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-genre.\nripping-good-yarns\nLike\nComment"}

The slight dispassion, the ability to half-ass its job and not care, the awkward inability to make conversation, the discovery that it has some level of caring when the right subject comes along, and its ability to binge-watch TV is all so human and relatable that it's difficult to not fall in love with Murderbot. Murderbot isn't a traditional hero by any stretch of the imagination, but it rises to the challenge in ways that surprise itself, and that is the mark of a good character.\n\nThe other characters in the novella are just as interesting, and figuring out their motivations is all part of the charm of this book. (Yes, I said \"charm\" about a book in which the main character is named \"Murderbot.\") Their personalities are part of the mystery as Murderbot (and the reader) has to decide who to trust.\n\nAnd the mystery! Unpacking what's happening to the survey team, what might be going on, who's responsible, and why is all part of the fun of this novella. I easily could have read another hundred pages with these characters and set in this world, but the tight pace, single-minded story, and elegant efficiency is part of what makes All Systems Red one of the best books I've read this year.\nhome-library\n \nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-08-06", "text": "Winterstar\n192 reviews\n1 follower\nFollow\nAugust 6, 2017\nThis was a short, nice science fiction read. The book is written in first person, and it's done well enough that it doesn't detract from the story. It takes a little while to figure out the bits and pieces. I thought through some of it that the main character wasn't too bright at times, but it is explained away by the way the main character is programs. Murderbot doesn't really have a gender- gender neutral so the best way to describe the main character is well, main character or Murderbot. We do find out why Murderbot is called such and it may not be what one might expect which was an interesting reveal. It was nice to see that not all scientists are nutters and not all people trapped together have to be murdering crazies either. I liked that Murderbot's crew were able to maintain their humanity. The plot flowed smoothly and the pacing good. The writing style was smooth and worked well. There is an ending, somewhat sad but at the same happy, but it also leaves it open for more stories. Overall a fun science fiction read from a different pov.\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

It explored a new science / tech (AI) in terms of ethic/social implications without beating it over your head.

I’m not sure this novella is good science fiction, but it’s very enjoyable anyway. I like a story where people receive help from an unexpected source.\n\nThe self-named “murderbot” is a humanoid construct, with a body which is part flesh and part mechanical. It’s working a tedious security detail for a team of scientists on a routine mission, and it mostly occupies itself by downloading and bingeing TV shows. When the mission suddenly becomes exciting, the construct finds itself interacting with real people far more than it ever intended to.\n\nThe construct thinks too much like a human for me to really believe it’s the robotic creation it’s supposed to be, but that doesn’t keep the story from being amusing and entertaining.\nnovella\n \nscience-fiction\n3 likes\n5 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I do know her Fantasy books (The Cloud Roads, Books of the Raksura), and I thought that her involvement in a SFFWorld ‘Round Table’ forum discussion a few years ago was thoughtful and entertaining, but that for me was about it.* So I was quite pleased when All Systems Red appeared in my review pile. For All Systems is an out and out SF Space Adventure tale, involving AI ‘killerbots’, corporate shenanigans and nasty alien lifeforms on unexplored planets. It’s a great read.\n\n“In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.\n\nBut in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.\n\nOn a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.\n\nBut when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.”\n\nAs you can read from the publisher’s blurb, the situation isn’t that different from current writers such as, say, Jay Posey or Ian McDonald – for those of an older persuasion, I’m going to suggest Ben Bova. Where All Systems Red scores though, is that it’s a great set-up – sort’ve like a Science-Fictional version of Dexter. The voice of the AI known as ‘SecUnit’ is great – a knowing, rather sassy but clearly intelligent personality that reminded me of Heinlein’s Mike from The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress or, at times, even Marvin the Paranoid Android from A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.  It’s clever and quite depreciating, which appealed to me a lot.\n\n “I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.”\n\nBeing a novella also means that there’s no space for extraneous waffle. The book begins with a bang, and then rarely lets up. Our Murderbot (the reason for that name is told along the way, but I’ll not spoil it now) is the SecUnit that has to be sent with a survey party by The Company (also later amusingly nicknamed “EvilSurvey”) to explore potential planets for development. In Alien-style plot development, whilst on a planet the team lose contact with the neighbouring survey team from DeltFall, something not too unusual with the cheap and basic equipment hired to them by the Company. However further investigation leads to the discovery of bigger mysteries and the consequences of their discovery.\n\nAfter 144 pages it’s done. And I want more. There are things still unexplained - will the Company find out if the rogue AI is rogue? What is the Company really up to? And what’s the bigger picture?\n\nThe ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, although I am pleased to type that there will be more in this series. In my opinion, there should be. There’s a pace that meant I read this one near-non-stop, in two sittings. Besides, how often do you read a tale rooting for the bad-guy (who’s clearly not as bad as it makes himself out to be)?\n\nSurprisingly good and thoroughly recommended entertainment.\n\n* (I now know, from reading the end of this one, that she has also written for the Stargate : Atlantis and Star Wars franchises, which makes sense.)", "text": "Mark\n692 reviews\n176 followers\nFollow\nAugust 13, 2017\nMust admit, I didn’t know that Martha Wells wrote SF.

The premise is that there is a security robot that has removed its governor module. It is owned by a corporation that provides equipment and bonding services for exploration teams. Like most stereotype corporations, this one goes cheap where they can, and sometimes people get hurt, which is not a problem for a normally functioning bot with its conscience governed. When things start going sideways and there are discrepancies with systems and information, what is Murderbot to do? This is a short read and left things open for a long line of adventures within a universe that has political and corporate intrigue, an interstellar civilization, and a rogue free security bot that everyone will assume is an augmented human.\nLike\nComment"}

I wanted to continue reading, I really did.\n\nIn that universe, there are humans, augmented humans, and constructs (which are part organic and inorganic but not easily divided). The story is about a SecUnit (security construct) who has managed to disable its governor. Now that it's autonomous (or as the company likes to call it \"rogue\"), it discovers that one reason for the governor is boredom and perhaps a bit of apathy which it chooses to fill with entertainment feeds, removing documentation it should've read to make room for more media. Being a free agent is not all its cracked up to be.\n\nThe universe is consistent. Survey teams representing companies or organizations contract with the \"company\" to go out and survey planets. Sometimes there's more than one survey team on a planet. The \"company\" provides all of the equipment from the habitats to the supplies to the \"hoppers\" (surface transports) to the scientific survey equipment. All of the equipment, while working together, doesn't always work well (as equipment manufactured by the lowest bidder tends to do). The computer systems (the HubSystem, SecSystem, and MedSystem) are all interconnected and wireless. You can dip into the \"feed\" as if you were checking Twitter.\n\nThere's a nice twist at the end which I'll just mention here for you to discover.\n\nBack to this book being short. Frankly I'd love to continue reading about this nameless SecUnit. I'd demand that the author keep writing more novellas about it (him?) but she's already prolific, so I'll just make an appeal: \"More, please.\"\nLike\nComment"}

It's just not quite my genre, robots generally aren't my thing and it's a sparse and - despite the premise - almost realistic piece of writing (as opposed to epic space adventures without much psychological believability for which I have a soft spot). I remember being very impressed with her fighting scenes in The Element of Fire and here she's equally competent with the technical, practical and security side of a planetary mission.

However, this is the first book in the Murderbot Diaries series so there may be more world-building in the later books.

In my defense, we'd been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn't had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\"\n\nI can relate to Murderbot, the misanthropic construct who is contracted to provide security detail for a small expedition to a planet. Murderbot, as the A.I. calls themselves (MB is sexless and has not chosen a pronoun), is plainly uncomfortable with personal attention and has little interest in anything outside entertainment videos and the bare minimum required to do their job. I have to confess that sounds like me during most of my adolescent years at every family event, ever, just substitute a book for video.\n\n\"They’re academics, surveyors, researchers, not action-hero explorers from the serials I liked because they were unrealistic and not depressing and sordid like reality.\"\n\nWritten as a novella, the plot takes off from page two. It isn't long before both Murderbot and the team realize they're facing multiple types of danger. Characterization is one of the outstanding parts of the story, with Murderbot's nature getting a lot of subtle build. The team never stood out to any great degree, but that's partly because until this expedition, Murderbot has had generally negative experiences with the people they have been contracted to protect and assumed this group would be more of the same. The leader, Dr. Mensah, soon distinguishes herself with crisis management and leadership, (\"It was starting to occur to me that Dr. Mensah might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer, even if she didn’t look like the ones on the entertainment feed\") while an augmented human, Gurathin, presents a different kind of challenge.\n\n“I do think of it as a person,” Gurathin said. “An angry, heavily armed person who has no reason to trust us.”\n“Then stop being mean to it,” Ratthi told him. “That might help.”\n\nMy one hesitation in calling it a five star book is the ending, which felt somewhat awkward and incongruous to the personality of earlier 'Bot, who displayed little curiosity or independence. I read the story twice, the second time doing the math on the length of time 'Bot has been independent. I'm guessing around four years, based on their own estimate of 35k hours since they \"failed to become an uncontrolled killing machine.\" The resolution felt like a shortcut, and like a logic failure in 'Bot's circuts. But I'm open to discussion on it.\n\nFinal resolution aside, I certainly enjoyed the ride. I predict some kind of award nomination next season.\n\nNote from 2020: This is the first novella in a series of four, followed by a novel. Technically, they all are independent installments, a lot like the serials 'Bot is so fond of watching. However, once I was able to re-read the four novellas as a group--instead of upon release--I found the overall emotional arc/plot even more enjoyable than as installments.\n\nNote from 2024: it's like a delicious bedtime story.\n\n\"I thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need... was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I'm a pessimist.\"\n\nMe too, Murderbot. Me too.\n\n\n\nFour and a half stars, rounding up because.\n\n\nLove the 'Bot and want to join a re/read? Discuss the upcoming release?

The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\"\n\nI can relate to Murderbot, the misanthropic construct who is contracted to provide security detail for a small expedition to a planet. Murderbot, as the A.I. calls themselves (MB is sexless and has not chosen a pronoun), is plainly uncomfortable with personal attention and has little interest in anything outside entertainment videos and the bare minimum required to do their job. I have to confess that sounds like me during most of my adolescent years at every family event, ever, just substitute a book for video.\n\n\"They’re academics, surveyors, researchers, not action-hero explorers from the serials I liked because they were unrealistic and not depressing and sordid like reality.\"\n\nWritten as a novella, the plot takes off from page two. It isn't long before both Murderbot and the team realize they're facing multiple types of danger. Characterization is one of the outstanding parts of the story, with Murderbot's nature getting a lot of subtle build. The team never stood out to any great degree, but that's partly because until this expedition, Murderbot has had generally negative experiences with the people they have been contracted to protect and assumed this group would be more of the same. The leader, Dr. Mensah, soon distinguishes herself with crisis management and leadership, (\"It was starting to occur to me that Dr. Mensah might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer, even if she didn’t look like the ones on the entertainment feed\") while an augmented human, Gurathin, presents a different kind of challenge.\n\n“I do think of it as a person,” Gurathin said. “An angry, heavily armed person who has no reason to trust us.”\n“Then stop being mean to it,” Ratthi told him. “That might help.”\n\nMy one hesitation in calling it a five star book is the ending, which felt somewhat awkward and incongruous to the personality of earlier 'Bot, who displayed little curiosity or independence. I read the story twice, the second time doing the math on the length of time 'Bot has been independent. I'm guessing around four years, based on their own estimate of 35k hours since they \"failed to become an uncontrolled killing machine.\" The resolution felt like a shortcut, and like a logic failure in 'Bot's circuts. But I'm open to discussion on it.\n\nFinal resolution aside, I certainly enjoyed the ride. I predict some kind of award nomination next season.\n\nNote from 2020: This is the first novella in a series of four, followed by a novel. Technically, they all are independent installments, a lot like the serials 'Bot is so fond of watching. However, once I was able to re-read the four novellas as a group--instead of upon release--I found the overall emotional arc/plot even more enjoyable than as installments.\n\nNote from 2024: it's like a delicious bedtime story.\n\n\"I thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need... was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I'm a pessimist.\"\n\nMe too, Murderbot. Me too.\n\n\n\nFour and a half stars, rounding up because.\n\n\nLove the 'Bot and want to join a re/read? Discuss the upcoming release? Nataliya and I lead a group:\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...\nawards-of-all-sorts\n \nbring-to-the-desert-island\n \nfast-and-fun\n \n...more\n998 likes\n92 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is a delight, this novella is a delight, and I need the next one posthaste.\n\nFrom the first page Murderbot's voice leaps off the page - the wry humor (I mean, \"Murderbot\"!), the social awkwardness, the obsession with media. Super relatable. Then as the plot unfolds and Murderbot slowly becomes attached to its clients...I don't even know what to say about it, I just found it incredibly satisfying.\n\nI have absolutely zero criticisms.

A fun and light robot murderer who hacks herself to have free will and she stops murdering to watch SF sitcoms instead. :)\n\nHonestly, that's pretty cool.

An obviously sentient A.I. being ordered about = slavery in my mind. That’s why I always side with the A.I. in SF stories where it isn’t 100% clear that the A.I. is an evil monster trying to murder humanity. So it’s really easy to side with Murderbot, the media loving security in the story. It’s just a novella so there isn’t a whole lot of character development aside from Murderbots, but there is plenty of action and a thoughtful plot, along with a likeable human cast of characters. I’ll be reading more in this series once they are released. Many thanks to Alice for her glowing review which lead me to read this.\n\n\n**edit reread I wanted to read this again as I've decided to finish the series and it's been a few years since I first read it.

{"username": "", "date": "Well that was a fun little diversion. And by little, I mean LITTLE! This is, hands down, the shortest book I've read all year. And also probably the easiest read I've done all year. Given my penchant for reading large and/or heady books, this one was pretty much a \"blink and you'll miss it\" deviation for me. It was also our book club pick following the behemoth that was Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, and we chose it because it was an easy read, which we felt was necessary after wading through the 1000+ pages of TWoK.\n\nSo what did I think of All Systems Red? Well, it was...good. That's about the best I can come up with at the moment. I loved the idea of a rogue Security bot that hacked its own governor, stopped caring about the corporate mission, and decided to basically be a TV junkie. And the fact that it refers to itself as Murderbot was just priceless. But outside of those concepts, the story just didn't really move me like I hoped it would.\n\nPart if this is, I'm sure, due to the brevity of the tale. There's not a lot of room for character arcs or deep plotting in a story this short. And I get it...it's not supposed to be a monster story. This is popcorn entertainment, and it achieves that goal rather well. But, that being said, I still was left feeling a little cold after reading All Systems Red. Nobody really gets any backstory or context, the people in the tale are essentially just random people who are assigned various archetypes and behaviors to stand out. I never got much of a visual of any of them. As for Murderbot, while admired the snarky way in which it narrated its tale, I still wanted to know more about it, and this never really came to pass.\n\nAnother thing that took away from my enjoyment is the way in which the narrative unfolds. I've read several books where the storytelling was...incidental at best. But All Systems Red takes the cake. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was just kind of half-explained or defined. From the action to the locations to the characters themselves, nothing is written in much detail. In fact, the action scenes were comprised mostly of passages that read something like \"I ran at it while shooting my projectile weapon. It was shooting at me at the same time. I got hit a few times, but I managed to find a vital area on my opponent and take it down.\" And...that's it. The problem with writing like this is it robs the story of any sense of drama or suspense. It's all so...casual. And that casual writing makes the narrative casual as well, which doesn't help to engage the reader as much.\n\nBecause this is a short novella, we jump from sequence to sequence pretty quickly, but even on things that I felt should have been given more weight, Martha Wells just kinda glosses over them. Not having read any of her other works, I can't say if this is just how she writes, or if she had to constrain herself to keep the story short & sweet. Again, I wanted more.\n\nBut it's not all bad! Murderbot is a fun narrator, and carries the first person POV tale quite well. I enjoyed the snark, the sarcasm, and the flippancy in which it viewed most situations it found itself in. I loved how anti-social Murderbot was, and how it really just wanted to be left alone to watch its video entertainment...aka soap operas.\n\nThe overall concept is also rather cool, but I feel that this could have been far more impactful as either a full-length novel or a larger novella.

{"username": "", "date": "2020-04-25", "text": "Ɗẳɳ 2.☊\n160 reviews\n313 followers\nFollow\nApril 25, 2020\nI must say, for a story subtitled The Murderbot Diaries, there was an appalling lack of murder and mayhem contained within these pages—well, at least by the hand of the so-called Murderbot. And that’s a shame because what other reason than to bathe in the glorious carnage would a reader select a title like this . . . ?\n\nMurderbot, as it dubs itself, is assigned to the security detail of a scientific expedition on an alien world. Its main roles are to protect the scientists from unknown alien threats and to ensure the success of the mission. Part man part machine, it’s designed to be entirely under the control of its clients. However, a malfunction in its programming has left it with free will—a fact that it hides from its employers for fear of being decommissioned. As well as the fact that it’s not the terrifying monster it appears to be. Underneath all that armor is one clever, quick-witted, and surprisingly sympathetic individual.\n\nOn the surface, all appears to be copacetic, but in reality, it only puts in the bare minimum of effort so as to devote as much time as possible to binge its favorite shows from the entertainment feed. It’s much more concerned about the fate of those fictional characters than its human masters. The only problem is there’s a section missing from their map of the planet, and the other expedition is failing to respond to their inquiries.\n\nSabotage seems to be afoot, and, sadly, Murderbot may have to pause its shows long enough to put in a real effort . . .\n\nThis story was completely lacking in depth of character. In fact, some of the names were so challenging—Bharadwaj, Volescu, Pin-Lee, Ratthi, Overse, Guarathin—that it was difficult to even keep track of who’s who, let alone their motivations. Even though the story was only a novella, I can’t forgive the lack of character development or worldbuilding. Off the top of my head, I can think of three shorter stories that excelled at both—Legion, Moot, and Defending Elysium.\n\nAlthough to be fair, the story was told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot who wasn’t overly concerned about the fate of these civilians, so why should we be?\n\n“You don’t know who we are? They didn’t tell you?”\n“There was an info packet in my initial download.” I was still staring out at the heavy green tangle just past the rocks. I really didn’t want to get into how little I paid attention to my job. “I didn’t read it.”\nArada said, gently, “Why not?”\nWith all of them staring at me, I couldn’t come up with a good lie. “I didn’t care.”\n\nBottom line: Although the narrator was far from a gifted storyteller, the plot was decent enough. But as a heartless killing machine, the poor girl was a terrible failure.\n\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #2: ★★★☆☆½\nThe Murderbot Diaries, #3: ★★★★☆\nalien-sci-fi\n \nnovella\n \nthe-final-frontier\n44 likes\n16 comments\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2017-10-22", "text": "Acqua\n536 reviews\n235 followers\nFollow\nOctober 22, 2017\nFor a book where the secondary characters were (deliberately?) really underdeveloped, I loved it a lot.\nIt's about a SecUnit (a self-aware security droid) that calls itself \"Murderbot\" and has gone rogue - it has hacked its governor module to access the combined feed of entertainment channels (it's a bored rogue bot). Now it can act freely, but that doesn't mean it will leave the humans in danger.\n\nI loved reading in the Murderbot's PoV. I was afraid it would sound mechanical, but it didn't - and it was really entertaining. A shy, murderous droid. It works.\n\nI loved how this book avoided the \"AI falls in love and discovers they're more human than they thought\" trope - one of the many overused subtropes of \"romantic love makes us human\", which I hate (I'm looking at you, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, and also at you, Defy the Stars). Murderbot is not human. Murderbot doesn't want to be human. That means it doesn't necessarily want what the humans want, and that doesn't mean it's evil.\nSince Murderbot is not exactly what humans expect when they think about machines, there's a lot of awkwardness between it and the human crew - they do not know how to deal with a machine that looks like a human and almost acts like a human, but it's definitely not one.\n\nMost side characters are forgettable, but there is a side f/f relationship and this is only a novella.\n\nNote: yes, the main character doesn't have a gender and is not interested in sex or romance, but I wouldn't recommend this book as \"aro/ace/agender representation\" - it's about a robot.\nAromantic/asexual/agender people are real and definitely human.\nadult\n \nbest-mcs\n \nloved-it\n \n...more\n8 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Insane.\n\nI was curious as to why when I told Goodreads I was reading this particular book – the first in the series - it didn’t bring up my old review. I figured it must be because I read it the first time as a trade edition, not a kindle edition. So I didn’t think about it.\n\nBut then I decided to look and see what I wrote about this book last time I read, nothing better, after all, than popping open my brain from a few years ago to see what was going on inside, and lo and behold, there was no review.\n\nI’d skipped a book.\n\nMy world crashed down upon me. I mean, am I in trouble? Are the review cops coming to haul me away? Am I getting kicked out the brotherhood? Would my family still love me?

I mean, they miss me there.\n\nSo, yeah, I may have failed, but I’m not a total loser.\n\nBut if I had written a review of the book when I first read it, just after came out, I imagine it would have gone something like this:\n\n\nWow, it’s 2017. Work has been crazy, putting in long hours, barely have time to read. But this book was great. Wish it were longer. Also, what’s the deal with my kids? Blah blah blah.

In case you were wondering, I didn’t just pull that from a time machine, which I invented and have used not to enrich myself, or to alter history for the better, but instead to ask myself my thoughts on books I’ve read, and still remember,sorta, in order to get a slightly different take on it since I just re-read said books. Yep, none of that happened. So not even worth mentioning.\n\nBut the older, wiser, more sophisticated me has a unique take on this, the very first of theMurderbot books. Yes, it was good, and yes, I do wish it were longer, and yes, work, and yes my kid! And yes, still have strong opinions about boring things. But also, as an islander now, I have to ask, what’s the deal with all the water?\n\nNo, that’s not it. I forgot, all that typing as set up and it slipped my mind.

I wish I could give you a well-considered reason for this, but I'm not sure I can produce one. It seemed like the plot took over and that was a lot less interesting than this fantastic, lazy Murderbot whose character, musings, and awkward interactions with humans Wells delights us with in the previous 2/3 of the book. It's not that the plot doesn't start until the last 1/3, but that the last 1/3 feels like a perfunctory going through the motions, like just filling in the blanks for the explanations needed.\n\nMurderbot has hacked his governor module, which means he no longer has to follow his programming and his more organic/human elements influence his thinking. He's kind of like a teenager who basically just wants to watch TV. He's pretty damn funny and rather endearing. And he's all too human: \"I don't know what I want... But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.\"\n\nI am looking forward to the next book in the series. Wells sets up a fascinating world with a wide range of human-machine life forms and interactions, as well as cost-cutting corporate-control at every turn. But mostly, I just want to keep following Murderbot.\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "books-of-2018", "text": "Evelina | AvalinahsBooks\n925 reviews\n472 followers\nFollow\nMarch 16, 2018\nI had heard all sorts of wonderful things about All Systems Red before I picked it up (I have a lot of Goodreads friends who know their stuff when it comes to sci-fi! Yes, I'm looking at you, Caro M.) Now I trust their recommendations even more, because this book is easily my best February read. You can read the post with better formatting here on my blog.\n\n5 Reasons To Read All Systems Red\n\n\"Murderbot\" is a jailbroken security android (cyborg? Well, you know.) Basically, SecUnits (as they're called) function as remotely controlled synthetic human slaves, basically, and they don't get a say in any of what they're doing, which is mostly murdering hostiles and getting mashed in the process. Murderbot though, a name it has sarcastically given itself (and will be henceforth referred to as 'them' in this review), have jailbroken themselves and would rather just watch hours and hours of sci-fi soaps than interact with humans, who actually give them anxiety fits. Murderbot is incredibly introverted, you see. But in order to not disclose a) having a mind b) having free will c) their predilection towards sci-fi soap operas, Murderbot still has to do their job. Which is how they end up on a ship with a crew they actually don't hate, but... on a mission nobody should be on. Hint: it's a mission that is kind of hard to survive, and it's clearly rigged.\n\n\nReason #1. Murderbot Is More Human Than The Actual Humans\n\nMurderbot comes across as an incredibly introverted personality who is empathetic like any other human being (maybe more so?), but shy of it and trying to hide it even from their own self. Seeing them turn to face the corner when talking to humans or panic while trying not to have their fave scrunch up into a mask of despair when being spoken to was incredibly amusing - and not in a mean way. Murderbot's shyness is SO relatable! You will love this character to bits. I know I did.\n\n\n\n\n\nReason #2. It's Like A Doctor Who Episode With David Tennant\n\nFor any Doctor Who fans, this book is like a good episode from the Tennant days – a hostile planet pretending to be neutral, and things slowly get worse and worse and he crew has to figure out what is up. It's just so good! My interest didn't drop even once, while reading this. And I realized how much I miss a good Doctor Who episode from the old days. (Well... the \"newer old days\"!)\n\n\n\n\nI thought this was topical on the whole #FEELS topic. Ha. Topic. Topical. (Don't hit me.)\n\n\nReason #3. The Virtues\n\nThis book has incredibly good virtues and such an amazing moral atmosphere. And it's presented in such a self-deprecating manner as well (Shruti, you must read this!) Murderbot is willing to throw themselves in danger to protect the ones they care about, even though they're aware humans are not really supposed to care \"back\". It's really touching how Murderbot calls them \"my humans\". I would say Murderbot is a true sci-fi knight.\n\n\n\n\n\nReason #4. Murderbot's Gender Or Lack Thereof\n\nWell, this is going to be hard to formulate. So, have you ever felt underrepresented? If you're a woman, you most likely have. Because we've got like maybe 2 heroes who jump in and save the day. Other than that, guys always do all the saving. Murderbot though? They don't really have a gender (and are often referred to as ‘it' in the book, but I refuse - Murderbot has too much personality for that!) Anyway, despite probably looking like Terminator, Murderbot is not referred to as male - which is why I found myself imagining them more female than male by the middle of the book! I was surprised, but I figure it comes from wanting to see myself represented as able to do stuff, you know? And Murderbot I'd a character that lets you do that. It's pretty great.\n\n\nReason #5. It's Just So Funny!\n\n\n\n\nSo maybe this should have been the number one reason. This book will keep you laughing throughout the entire time you're reading it, I mean, when you're not having #feels. The manner it is written, and especially the manner Murderbot talks in is just priceless. I can't wait for further installments of The Murderbot diaries!\n\n\nOther Books You Might Like\n\nI wish I could recommend you more books like that! But such gems are not common. And I would be very happy if you recommended me something similar. Meanwhile, I can only think of two books that fit the style – in terms of humor, at least. Redshirts has the same kind of \"I can't stop laughing\" thing going on, and also shares some moments of poignancy by the end. It's also impossible to put down. As for The Martian, some of the topics might be unrelated at all, but the main character is similar to Murderbot – very resourcefull, brave and has the same vein of humor in the way he talks. It's also written in first person. I enjoyed both of these a lot!\n\n\n\n\nRead Post on My Blog | My Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter\nbooks-of-2018\n \nfavorites\n \nfiction\n \n...more\n43 likes\n8 comments\nLike\nComment"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\"\n\nAs first paragraphs go, this book (which feels like The Perks of Being a Wallflower mixed with I Robot) is hard to beat. That's the premise of All Systems Red, where self-stylized Murderbot (think Abed Nadir with some mechanical parts), having achieved sentience, desires nothing more than to be left alone and watch TV for the remainder of it's existence. However, the same culture of complacency and corruption in the ubiquitous parent company company which allowed Murderbot to break free of it's robotic fetters enable a mysterious enemy to interfere with Murderbot's carefully laid lack of plans.\n\nA very short book, this makes for a quick, but fantastic read.

What would happen if humans lost that control?\n\nFor a novella just around 150 pages, this book read like a much longer book...in a good way.

I just watched the fourth episode of the apple TV adaptation and kept complaining loudly how untrue to the book it is. Nope, I have bad recall! So, again the Graphic Audio… They did a good job with that fourth episode.

I just read System Collapse (Murderbot #7), had a lot of fun and decided that it is finally time for a re-read of the entire series.\n\nWow, I didn‘t remember that the plot was so dramatic! I had forgotten most of it. And I had also forgotten that so many of the characters showing up in later novellas were here already. I also didn‘t recall the quieter scenes. Maybe it needs a re-read to pick up those details.\n\nNot trying to assign a gender to Murderbot anymore.

This is a winner!\n\n\"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\"\nThat could be me on any given day.\n\nLots of potential. Is Murderbot a real person or not? The awkwardness of the crew, trying to figure out the correct way of interacting with Murderbot, once they realized that perhaps there is a person behind that opaque faceplate, was pretty priceless.\n\nAnd Murderbot's horror at their attempts to interact! Talking to the humans! And feelings, oh no!\n\nI tried not to assign a gender to Murderbot. I don't want to use \"it\" as a personal pronoun. I am leaning towards using \"him\", not quite sure why.

Murderbot has long ago hacked its governor chip, meaning it has free will, but it must keep this fact hidden or risk being dismantled, or worse, become a mindless drone again for The Company. When things go wrong on the expedition, however, Murderbot finds it harder and harder to stay hidden and still keep the humans safe.\nMy affection for stories about Artificial Intelligence was firmly established a few years ago when I re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation and found that Data has become my favorite character. Or maybe it goes all the way back to my teenage years when I unexpectedly fell in love with Terminator 2 which I saw 7 times in the movie theater (I happened to work at a theater at the time so it's not that impressive...or geeky - Much). I think I really enjoy the scope stories abut AIs give to ask big questions like...what does it mean to be human?...what is life?...what constitutes sentience?... but in a way that is more entertaining and less stuffy than reading a philosophy text book.\n\nAnd that's the main reason you should read All Systems Red - it's hugely entertaining! Murderbot is one of the best characters I've read all year. The very vision of a bored, apathetic, socially awkward corporate worker who can't wait to get off and lose itself in the thousands of hours of entertainment serials it can download. It has a wicked, sardonic sense of humor and cynical outlook on life that was a beauty to behold and often made me laugh out loud. We've mostly all been there and had to try to hide that negative, shy, pathetic side of ourselves.\n\nThe difference with Murderbot is that it's a made thing out of a blend of organic and inorganic materials and it is not supposed to have a personality. It's also not supposed to care about the humans it is guarding but even though it is inclined not to, it does, because they are a nice, intelligent, tight knit group of friends that don't make Murderbot do horrible or humiliating things. Against its will, it develops an affection for them or, at least, doesn't want to see them die.\n\nThe story is also fast-paced and a lot of fun being part mystery, part sci-fi thriller and part action-adventure. Given that this is a novella and only has a limited page count, Wells does an admirable job telling a well-rounded, satisfying and complete story that also left me wanting more and excited that this is book one in a series. You can probably thank Murderbot for me wanting more!\n\nThe society and and context of the \"Sec Units\" in the universe is also well established, which is again really impressive for such a short book especially since the world-building is well-integrated into the plot and does not slow the pace down one bit.\n\nAll in all this was a very enjoyable and neat bit of storytelling which I would highly recommend!\n\nFINAL VERDICT: A really entertaining and well told AI novella!\n2017reads\n \nauthor-white\n \nfemaleauthor\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

All Systems Red delivers exactly the kind of thing I want to see in a book told through a robot's eyes, in a tight little novella. Murderbot is a security bot, who has hacked itself and overridden its security protocols, partly so it can make judgment calls on its orders, and partly so it can watch countless hours of TV. When the research expedition Murderbot is working for starts having problems much bigger than the brochure advertised, things get interesting.\n\nThe book is very short so I don't want to talk too much about the plot, but Wells keeps things comprehensible and entertaining, all while touching on many of the interesting questions that come up when we talk about artificial intelligence. What makes someone a human, what makes someone a being? I think the argument of whether something non-biological can have sapience really brings up more questions on what it means to be human than what it means to be robot. And when it's well done, it's fascinating, it's compelling, and it's great fun to read.\n\nMurderbot is also a very lovable character, which might be surprising for a being that calls itself 'Murderbot'. But being broken and flawed and terrible at social interaction give this robot more character, illicits more sympathy, than many human characters manage to.\n\nAll Systems Red also manages to contain a story that feels complete in itself, while still setting up for future books. Which is fantastic, because I love Murderbot, and would gladly read only about Murderbot for as much as I can.\nartificial-intelligence\n \nnovella\n \nown-ebook\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

The plot's straight-forward, the prose is decent, and it's charming and witty. Murderbot, who repeatedly says that she'd rather be netflixing, is surprisingly relatable. One of my favorite parts is when Murderbot is faced with the prospect of spending time with people and is (understandably) horrified. She can't control her facial reaction which in turn makes the human crew she's assigned to uncomfortable to know that they're making Murderbot uncomfortable (and that she has feelings as human as any of them).\n\nAlso, I've just realized that I've been using female pronouns for Murderbot, when Murderbot is actually genderless and is referred to as 'it' by the crew. For some reason I naturally thought of Murderbot as being female and I'm not sure why, maybe because the author is a woman?\n\nPosted in Mr. Philip's Library\n2017-releases\n \nauthor-woman\n \nhugo\n \n...more\n99 likes\n18 comments\nLike\nComment"}

All Systems Red is less than 150 small pages long. Barely an evenings read.\nOtherwise, this work is simply magnificent. By the end, I realised that although I have been reading AI and robot scifi for over 40 years, starting with my total immersion in I Robot by Asimov - that nevertheless I have never been brought to empathise as closely with a Bot as is achieved here.\nAnd perhaps (although resented by me) the brevity is an artform in itself, as the author manages to construct and bring to credible close, worlds, characters and plausible story without ever seeming to rush, yet keeping the pages turning.\nThe downside is, no library I've found holds this series, and I'm hooked, but loath to fork out $20 a pop for each of the (6?) subsequent, cheaply bound paperbacks.\n\nThe books are by TOR, and are very lightly bound in soft cover.

Muderbot is such a great protagonists. And I feel like I was unnecessarily critical of the world-building last time. There's nothing wrong with it, we just don't get a lot because this is a short book focused on making sure we get to know Muderbot well, which we do. I'm excited to finally continue the series.\n\n*********************************************\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this novella. Even though the synopsis sounded really cool, I didn't have many expectations. It's about a robot, but since it also has organic parts, I'm thinking more of a cyborg. But that's beside the point. The protagonist, and narrator, refers to itself as Murderbot. It's managed to hack into its system and sever the part which makes it obligated to obey the company that created it. The first line of the novella is this:\n\nI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\n\nI mean, how awesome is that? Anyone who decides to forgo mass murder because there are so many book and TV shows to watch... that's my kind of person.\n\nThen there's the fact that it genuinely does not give a fuck about anyone. It just wants to watch the shows and be left alone. It only does a half-assed job whenever it's assigned to accompany a team of employers for their survey on a planet, acting as monitor and security. This time, there's another team, people who actually seem nice. Not that it cares. It usually avoids people. But then stuff starts to go wrong and our beloved Murderbot may be the only chance of the team's survival.\n\nIt's a good plot. And the side characters are likable. I especially liked the team leader and the one guy who didn't like our Murderbot. The world building could use work. I still can't get a clear picture of what kind of world the novella is set in. If it weren't for the protagonist being as brilliant as it is, the novella wouldn't have been as good.\n\nBack to Murderbot. I love this it. In fact, I have a couple more quotes from the novella.\n\n\"Are you all right?\"\nThat was too much attention. I turned around and walked into the corner, facing away from them.\n\n\nI liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked the real ones, but you can't have one without the other.\n\nHow could you not love it?! I can't wait to see where it will go next, especially after that ending, which I also loved. I highly recommend this novella, if only just so you can get to know Murderbot.\n2017-reads\n \nthe-great-short\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I'll say no more, because of spoilers, but I suspect you'll know what I mean if you've read it. Still, a very promising start and I'll happily read more.\n\nA re-read a couple of years later confirmed those impressions - loved it, right up to a rather abrupt end.

This first \"Murderbot\" novella is therefore a working hard-boiled story. Someone has slaughtered the scientists at one planetary survey base, and the inhabitants of the other, with their security robot (aka the titular Murderbot), have to figure out who and why, while also trying to stay alive. Murderbot's unexpected musings on humanity, the society that created him, and the nature of free will provide the philosophical and thematic base of the story, but this is a locked-room (or base) mystery with a corking good supporting cast and a suspenseful ending.

{"username": "", "date": "2017-12-23", "text": "Thomas\n2,087 reviews\n83 followers\nFollow\nOctober 13, 2017\nMeet Murderbot. Murderbot is a half-robot, half-organic construct that's been hired to assist an excavation crew doing a survey on a new planet. Murderbot has disabled the governor in itself, allowing it to do such things as ignore direct orders, skip scheduled upgrades, and not follow its own directives. In short, Murderbot has become a sentient entity without any restraints. Luckily, \"Murderbot\" doesn't accurately describe itself.\n\nThis novella is an intriguing look at human/robot relations, as told from the perspective of the robot. There may be more to Murderbot's organic side than this story lets on (it doesn't have complete recall on some events that happened in its past), but the way the story is told, it feels like it's more robot than organic. That being said, this is the first in a series of novellas, so maybe that's something we'll learn in a future volume. Regardless, Murderbot has an empathetic side, as well as other emotions that her human co-workers didn't expect to see.\n\nI'm a reader of the webcomic Questionable Content, and as I was reading this story, I kept picturing Bubbles as Murderbot. As such, it made me envision Murberbot as female, even though there's nothing in the story to support it. Due to that connection, or possibly to the fact that the author is female, Murderbot felt female to me throughout the story. I don't know if other readers got that feeling out of the story; I'd be curious to know.\n\nThe story is set in a science-fictional world, but at its heart, it's a mystery. The story opens part of the way into the excavation, and we learn that a good chunk of their information has gone missing from their files. At that point, the characters have to learn who's behind the sabotage, before things turn deadly. The structure of the story feels like a whodunnit, and I see one other review has labeled it as a hard-boiled story, which I get, though I don't necessarily agree.\n\nEither way, this is a sharp story with an engaging narrator and likable supporting characters. It doesn't quite reach the four-star level with me, but that's likely due to having high expectations going into the story. All Systems Red is getting tremendous hype, not unjustly, but I was expecting something a bit more wowie-zowie out of it based on it all. I'll definitely read the rest of the series, though.\n2017\n \ne-book\n \nmystery\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-10-12", "text": "Stephen\n473 reviews\n64 followers\nFollow\nOctober 12, 2017\nEnjoyable sci-fi read. Liked Murderbot, the too human cyborg at the center of this drama. A very original character. Built to be a robotic security agent, he has hacked his system to allow freewill, only to find he really doesn't care to do much besides watching serial TV shows. When called on to protect his clients, he initially does so more because it's his job and he'd feel stupid watching videos instead than any order or commitment. As he gets to know his clients he finds he's more invested in their well being than expected and goes to great lengths to protect them\n\nLiked the supporting characters, setting and drama built in the earlier parts of the story. That drama unfortunately fizzles in the the big reveal when the \nvillain turns out to be a not to clever bureaucrat vs someone truly villainous. How dumb is this guy? He's knows when he meets Murderbot on the plateau outside GrayCris' camp that Murderbot has somehow protected and hidden his clients and killed or disabled three SecUnits left behind at the DeltFall camp with no apparent injury to himself. Murderbot is therefore smart and exceedingly dangerous. Murderbot tells him that he has no governor and therefore operates with free will. Message: Everything Murderbot has done was done by choice vs order or programming. He's unlikely to trust anything the person trying to kill him promises. Yet Blue assumes that he will follow his order to retrieve Mensah based on a weak promise and sends only one SecUnit to kill him.. What could have been an epic battle of wits and firepower to escape the planet never happens.\n\nThe final pages are also completely out of character. Murderbot doesn't really like people and has no idea what he wants to do but in the space a single page hatches a completely random plan to \nleave those who care about him behind in favor of hopping a ride on a random ship and life where he is almost certain to have to deal with complete strangers. I understand setting up for a sequel but this could have been done with more elegance in line with the Murderbot character established throughout the rest of the book.\n\nSo, 3 stars instead of 4 due to a weak ending, but still a recommended read.\n6 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Having our hero be an apathetic, pessimistic killer android who can’t stand being looked at without its helmet on (who, basically, can't stand to be seen and/or seen as vaguely human) and who just wants to spend its time in the comforting grip of TV might seem to some readers like an outlandish premise, but in Wells’ hands Murderbot is wonderfully relatable, very funny, and a great narrator, editorial asides and all. The story is well put together and sketches out an intriguing future, but the real draw is our host, and the result is a story that builds to an unexpectedly moving climax. I'm definitely eager to read more from our SecUnit.\n2017\n \nrt\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2021 reread:\n\nThis was just what the doctor ordered.\n\nA planetary survey crew's Security 'droid has secretly hacked its governor module, but instead of killing the humans it just wants to be left alone and watch media.\n\n\nIt had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n\n\nWhen there are signs that the mission had been sabotaged, however, and the neighboring mission goes dark it has to help its humans to figure out what is happening.\n\nThis novella's strengths are its relentless pace and its unique main character. Murderbot is a non-binary half bot / half human construct, that is painfully shy and is still figuring out its own personality, while initially trying to pretend that it is just a SecUnit that is following orders. Turns out its humans are really nice, though, which only makes matters worse, because now there might be other reasons to actually try to keep them alive, apart from it looking bad on Murderbot's record if it fails to do so. Murderbot, however, feels far more comfortable with the fictional characters of its favorite soap opera than it does with being around real people.\n\nWhile the awkward interactions between Murderbot and the rest of the crew are rather sweet, the rogue SecUnit's inner monologue is often extremely funny. It is snarky, a little grumpy, sarcastic. But under its armor Murderbot is a little softie. A softie with build-in weaponry.\n\n\nGurathin turned to me. \"So you don't have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\"\nI looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”\n\nWhich comes in handy (the guns - not being a softie) when the shit hits the fan.\n\nAll the while this little book also has some interesting things to say about free will, human treatment of androids and about being an introvert.\n\nIt is a quick read that is fun and streamlined, but not shallow.

Cheesy, campy, rollicking fun... and emotionally poignant. There's some surprisingly heavy themes wrapped up in this bit of easily digestible fluff, and I think I have a new favorite character.\n\nThe shortness does have some downsides. The characters don't get much description, and there's a lot of telling instead of showing, but I suspect that's intentional. Somehow, maybe because of the brevity, it manages to work, coming across as Murderbot telling its story to the reader. But that same shortness keeps the story cohesive (if, as previously mentioned, quite campy).\n\nI don't know. Eternal classic of literature? Probably not, but it was exactly what I needed. Giving it 5* anyway, because it's been a while since I enjoyed a book that much.\nform-novella\n \ngenre-action\n \nread-in-2017\n \n...more\n8 likes\n4 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot’s journey to true autonomy is also interesting. The ‘thriller mystery’ part of the plot is really one note and makes little sense (even the characters in the story say so).

This book deserves the top rating; it was both good and fun. And as a novella, it's a useful book-length to use to explore an interesting idea: What is the perspective of an AI (contained in a robot) that is part of a human team in a difficult situation where the AIs training and interests might diverge from the human's?\n\nYou learn in the first paragraph that the AI should have a constraining governor in it that keeps it from having human-level attachments & feelings, but which is non-functional during the episode of the book. The AI was built to be a killing machine, but forcibly constrained (\"covered\") to be in the service of humans. When the governor doesn't work, will such an AI be nice to us?\n\nThis is a question that is \"in the air\" in popular culture now because of the rapid advancement of AI capabilities and HW/SW. This book doesn't have a deep intellectual exploration of the possibilities, the way academic (or popular non-fictional) treatments do. Instead, the author/story takes a position, and lets the story emerge.\n\nThe story itself is interesting, fast-paced, and very well written by a competent author. And, frankly, it's fun. Because the book is so short, I'm seriously tempted to re-read it just because of the joy I had reading it.\n\nOnline scuttlebutt says this will become part of a series, or a further-developed story. I can't wait to read more.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2017-11-04", "text": "John\nAuthor \n4 books\n27 followers\nFollow\nNovember 4, 2017\nWells spins a good yarn. An interesting take on artificial intelligence (AI), with the story told from the AI's point of view. In this case, the AI is a \"murderbot\", and sort of humanoid/machine that is meant to provide security for humans on a planetary expedition. It hacks into its own firmware and bypasses those controls that tie it to servitude to humans. But instead of going off the rails--as robots predictably do in so many sci fi novels--it instead becomes more human.\n\nThe story held my interest all the way through, until the final chapter, which came across as a sort of afterthought, an addendum to the \"real\" story, and something I thought wasn't really necessary. It felt rushed and forced, but it did set the story up for a sequel, or a series. Still, I feel it could have been accomplished earlier in the story. In any event, the book is relatively short (I read it in one sitting) and posits some good old fashioned hard sci fi plot lines. Worth a read.\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

As it turned out though, this little novella was a real treat.\n\nTold from the point of a view of a rogue SecUnit—a part organic, part synthetic android designed to provide humans with protection and security services—this story takes readers on a journey to a distant planet being explored by team of scientists. Accompanying them is our protagonist, a self-proclaimed “Murderbot”, whose presence is required by the Company sponsoring the mission. Thing is though, Murderbot doesn’t exactly feel warm and fuzzy towards humans, and it knows that the scientists aren’t too comfortable with having a SecUnit on the team either, given the cagey way they get whenever it’s around.\n\nStill, that’s just fine for Murderbot. Having hacked its own governor so that it doesn’t have to follow Company directives, all it wants is to be left alone to enjoy the thousands of hours of entertainment vids that it has downloaded from the humans’ satellites. Of course, no one can suspect that Murderbot is secretly autonomous, so it still has to go about its job like everything is normal, and this arrangement was working out just fine until one day, a routine surface test goes seriously wrong. Murderbot ends up saving the day, earning the admiration and curiosity of the team leader, Dr. Mensah. Soon, Murderbot is left with no choice but to take the lead in defending the scientists, when disaster strikes another neighboring expedition on the planet and threatens to come after them next.\n\nHaving read a few of the author’s Raksura novels, I was already familiar with her penchant for throwing readers into the thick of things, leaving them to gradually feel everything out for themselves. Thus I was unsurprised with the way this story opened—by unceremoniously dropping us into Murderbot’s head with hardly any context and minimal background information given. It takes a while to even grasp the kind of protagonist Murderbot is: an artificial entity, albeit a very sentient and self-aware one, complete with personality quirks and a dry sense of humor. While I’ve read plenty of books starring robot protagonists, I can honestly say I’ve never met one quite as unique and interesting as Murderbot. Martha Wells may be tight-fisted when it comes to the details, but she knows exactly how to get your attention. Everything from Murderbot’s anti-social tendencies to its love of cheesy soap operas made me want to keep reading to discover more about the character and why it is telling this story.\n\nAt just a little under 150 pages though, and with so much ground to cover, there’s not much opportunity to stop and take a breath. As much as I loved how this book was so snappy and fast-paced, you do have to find your footing quickly or risk getting left behind. This means learning and familiarizing yourself with the characters as soon as they’re introduced, and most of them, like the humans on the science team, are only going to be lightly sketched. This was probably my only criticism; considering how over time, Murderbot comes to see the team as “its humans” and become very protective of them, it would have been helpful to develop those characters a bit more, especially since our protagonist begins this tale by being very disdainful of them.\n\nStill, there wasn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about this book. It was entertaining, and more importantly, it also felt complete to me, unlike a lot of novellas that leave me wanting more. Plus, this snarky first-person narrative style is quite different from what I’m used to when it comes to Wells, but I think I could grow to like it! Murderbot’s narration was a joy to follow, and I even found myself chuckling at many of the story’s scenes. Overall, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and I definitely would not hesitate recommending All Systems Red to anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix with a fun and captivating premise.

While I’ve read plenty of books starring robot protagonists, I can honestly say I’ve never met one quite as unique and interesting as Murderbot. Martha Wells may be tight-fisted when it comes to the details, but she knows exactly how to get your attention. Everything from Murderbot’s anti-social tendencies to its love of cheesy soap operas made me want to keep reading to discover more about the character and why it is telling this story.\n\nAt just a little under 150 pages though, and with so much ground to cover, there’s not much opportunity to stop and take a breath. As much as I loved how this book was so snappy and fast-paced, you do have to find your footing quickly or risk getting left behind. This means learning and familiarizing yourself with the characters as soon as they’re introduced, and most of them, like the humans on the science team, are only going to be lightly sketched. This was probably my only criticism; considering how over time, Murderbot comes to see the team as “its humans” and become very protective of them, it would have been helpful to develop those characters a bit more, especially since our protagonist begins this tale by being very disdainful of them.\n\nStill, there wasn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about this book. It was entertaining, and more importantly, it also felt complete to me, unlike a lot of novellas that leave me wanting more. Plus, this snarky first-person narrative style is quite different from what I’m used to when it comes to Wells, but I think I could grow to like it! Murderbot’s narration was a joy to follow, and I even found myself chuckling at many of the story’s scenes. Overall, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and I definitely would not hesitate recommending All Systems Red to anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix with a fun and captivating premise. I was excited when I found out this was going to be a series, and I can’t wait to check out the next installment of the Murderbot Diaries.\narcs-and-galleys\n \nnovella\n \nreview-copy\n \n...more\n49 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

Really quite excellent, actually. It would've rated higher, but it was short and left me wanting more whereas a 5-star book leaves me feeling sated.\n\nBased on the title I thought this was going to be a violent SF horror novel, but it's misleading. A cyborg SecUnit who thinks of himself as \"Murderbot\" is rented out as security detail to a team of human scientists doing planetary research. Unlike millions of other SecUnits, this one is complicated, smart and individualistic - things that Units aren't supposed to be. As the situation on the planet becomes dangerous and the SecUnit shows himself to be trustworthy, his clients grow attached to him. And although he's programmed to be impersonal, he grows fond of them in a distant, confused way.\n\nThe best part of this book is seeing how the SecUnit fights against emotions he doesn't understand and doesn't want to understand. Although I enjoyed the skulduggery elements too (I have thus far neglected to mention the major storyline involving sabotage, murder and bribery), it was the brilliantly written SecUnit's struggle with his unnatural feelings of humanity that pushed this book from good to great and nearly perfect. I just wish it had been longer and shared more of SecUnit's background.\n4-stars\n \nfavorite-authors\n \ng-sci-fi\n \n...more\n10 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

I also found an interview with Ms. Wells. Here is one of the questions regarding this book:\n\nQ: Has there been any interest in turning All Systems Red into a movie or TV show?\n\nA: No, there’s been no interest that I know of. I’m not sure what would work best, though a movie or TV show would have to have a lot of voiceover, since so much of the story is internal to the main character.\n\nQ: If this did happen, who would you like to see play the main characters and why them?\n\nA: I’m not sure who would play Murderbot. I was always kind of imagining Viola Davis [Suicide Squad] for Dr. Mensah. In the story, Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon, is meant to be a far future version of How To Get Away With Murder.\n\nEntry # 3\n\nI have read a couple of times now, in two different interviews, that Ms. Wells credits that murderbot was inspired by Tanith Lee's \"Silver Metal Lover\" and Tanith Lee's writing in general. Ms. Wells has grown in stature in my reading opinion.\n\nThis book was certainly well written and an entertaining story and I totally look forward to the next installment of this series.\n2017-09-books-bought\n101 likes\n3 comments\nLike\nComment"}

After gaining consciousness, Murderbot thinks about killing all humans, only to push it off in favor of watching the thousands of hours of media he now has access to. But when his team’s mission starts going awry, Murderbot has to start interacting with the very humans he dislikes, all without giving away that he’s now conscious. Just a funny and well-written character backed by an interesting story.\n\n(Editor’s Note: A lot of reviewers are referring to Murderbot as a female, although Murderbot is more accurately an “it.” I always pictured Murderbot as male because its DGAF attitude re: work reminded me so strongly of Jay Cutler)\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

We could watch Netflix and be buddies.\n\nThis book is super fun, but also really sweet. Murderbot is a security robot who hacked its own governor chip, allowing it to have full autonomy. It's bored and watches lots of TV, and just kind of half-asses its security job. Then things start going wrong and it actually has to interact with its humans to figure out what's going on and keep them safe.\n\n(I keep wanting to call Murderbot \"her\", but... it's a bot. It literally has no gender or sex. But I think of it as feminine, I think because of the robot named Bubbles in Questionable Content.)\n\nBeyond the basic plot, this story is entirely endearing. Murderbot is awkward with humans, but they are all nice so it actually likes these humans, but it doesn't know how to really interact with them, and it's all a mess. It definitely has opinions on its shows, though. By the end, I just wanted to hug Murderbot, though I know it would not be at all comfortable with that so I'd have to maybe resort to finding a camera and giving it an enthusiastic thumbs-up.\nread-in-2017\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The very first chapter let me know that I was really going to enjoy this ride. And I did.\n\n\nI COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\n-p1\n\n\n\nMurderbot is incredibly snarky – which I appreciate. Murderbot is a SecUnit construct – part organic, part bionic – with no sexual parts, making it agendered. It does not have a name other than what it named itself: Murderbot. It does not think of itself with as a gender but I decided it was a she (in my head). Murderbot, like most of us, is contemptuous of humans and irritated by them – she/it just wants to be left alone so it could stream. 35,000 hours of entertainment thus far – with many, many more series to glom.\n\nOh, how I understand you, Murderbot. That irritation you feel each time someone interrupts your streaming with some inane human request or activity? I am there with you. That annoyance you feel when you have to pause a show to deal with “real life” is quite the same way I feel when I have to put down my book(s) and go to work. The desire you feel to murder someone because they can’t understand that YES, You ARE busy consuming things you want to consume? It’s like an itch you can’t scratch...and plus who has time for murder when you can get back to reading as soon as they leave you alone?\n\nMurderbot was created and is owned by “the company.” IDK exactly who/what the company is – there is no real explanation. The company seems to be some large private conglomerate that has a monopoly on [new] planet exploration. The company then sells sections of the planet along with survey specs to different exploration groups looking for new flora and fauna. In order to buy these sections (and the ability to explore and possibly discover new things) the exploration groups must also purchase [only] company supplies, computer equipment, life support & Communications (HubSystem) and SecUnits (android security units). The SecUnits are required and gives the company an additional edge: the SecUnits + the HubSystem records EVERYTHING (no privacy at all). And like all good conglomerates, the company buys everything as cheap as possible AND they farm all recordings for as much data as possible and then sells it to the highest bidder.\n\nMurderbot is a SecUnit who is completely self-aware (IDK if any of the others are but I get the feeling they are). Murderbot hacked it’s “governor module” as soon as it could do so, making it autonomous. This means that Murderbot decides when and if it will download updates as well what it will attend to. Mostly, it wants to attend to the series it’s currently downloaded.\n\nMurderbot develops an unlikely attachment to its human contracts – mostly because they are a small, close-knit group of eight. They don’t treat it like equipment – they seem to like it and think of it as more of someone enslaved instead of a construct – which Murderbot finds both weirdly endearing and weird in an “OMG! Help! The stupid humans want to TALK to me about feelings and stuff and OMG leave me alone!” way. Therefore, Murderbot is much more interested in keeping this group alive than most. Luckily for Murderbot’s contracts cause the shit hits the fan and splatters rather quickly.\n\nI really don’t want to discuss much more of the plot than the above as I don’t want to spoil any of it. Suffice to say that Murderbot is a great character and All Systems Red was a great novella. I certainly plan on reading any new additions to this series.\n\n2017\n \n2017-reading-challenges\n \namazing-amazingness\n \n...more\n7 likes\n7 comments\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot is a shy, awkward, introvert who spends the majority of it's time watching reality TV (haha while pretending to follow orders from the humans). It's a cyborg with free will who lives in a world where cyborgs are mindless machines completely controlled by corporations. What an interesting concept.\n\nWhen I began reading, I was under the impression that this would be dark, but it was really just cynical and mostly lighthearted. It was more comical than I expected, but I am not disappointed at all because I love Murderbot's character so much! I was so happy for the way Murderbot's story ended. The possibilities for the next book are endless. Overall this book was a fun read! I am sure there are plenty of books that explore a similar concept and are very dark and heart wrenching. I appreciate that this one did something different.\n\nThe reason I initially gave this book 3 stars was due to the lack of a complex plot. It really was straightforward and predictable. Now that I have had time to think about it, I believe the main focus was Muderbot and the exploration of the \"other\" and what it means to be prejudice. This is most likely why the plot was simple. I also appreciate the world building much more now then I did initially. It was more complex and intriguing then I gave it credit for. I honestly can not stop thinking about this novella. I can't wait to read the next one!! I might even change my rating to 4 stars. I think I was so wrapped up in what I thought it was supposed to be that I didn't appreciate it for what it was.\nfavorites\n \nfemale-sff-adult\n \nsci-fi\n \n...more\n13 likes\nLike\nComment"}

At just over a 150 paged this book is all killer no filler telling the story of Murderbot, a recently self aware half organic/robotic, who at the start of the story has recently hacked his system so that he is beholden to nobody and can do as he pleases. The book covers a research team on a remote planet who are there for preservation and the Murderbot is supplied by the company who allow such expeditions as protection to this crew.\n\nWhat follows is a thrilling tale of murder, a rival faction seeking to get the resources this planet has and to eliminate anyone else who are there. Murderbot is the first person narrator of this book and his new found freedom leads to some funny and witting internal monologue as he tries to cope and deal with his humans who he no longer is obligated to protect but does so anyway because he likes their leader.\n\nThe book as plenty of action and the resolution is true to the Murderbot’s character especially since you spend the whole book in his head, as he reflects on what he wants based on his newfound feelings and the media feed which he obsessively watches throughout the novel which are also a source of some of the funnier moments. I recently heard this is going to become an ongoing series and if the next book is even half as entertaining as this one it will be another 5 star rating from me!\nLike\nComment"}

The crew members are a bit lacking in depth, but I think that's intentional; Murderbot knows little about them and prefers to avoid interacting with humans, and we see the human characters through its eyes, with the same distance it does.\n\nMore of a 4.5/5 stars.

I really resonated with Murderbot. Fast-paced, the action pretty much starts on page 1. Being a novella, there is no room for a meandering storyline. It gets right to the point.\n\nMy only reservation is that it is hard to tell the humans apart. Although this could be deliberate on the authors part because the story is written from the perspective of Murderbot. Murderbot wouldn’t care about human features and characteristics so there are no descriptions of them. This just means that I will have to reread it to get all the names and people straight.\n\nscifi\n \nshort-stories\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Wells does an amazing job of sketching out Murderbot's core concept in a the few few paragraphs: security droid who is secretly self-aware but would rather watch soap operas than go on a murderous rampage. She also does an amazing job with Murderbot's voice, giving it life an personality as it makes its own (not terribly flattering) observations of the humans its charged with guarding. Wells is really careful to capture and leave out the things that Murderbot would and wouldn't care about, which gives its voice a very distinct flavor since its priorities are obviously different. It's an interesting take on \"machine becomes self-aware\"; Murderbot doesn't think about things in a human way, but also not in a mechanical way. There's so much personality in Murderbot that I actually wonder how self-aware bots are when they don't have cracked governors. It's a rather terrible thought.\n\nBeneath the flippancy of Murderbot's voice, though, there is the subplot of Murderbot trying to figure out what to do now that it is self-aware. Honestly, avoiding the whole question with a 400+ episode soap opera sounds like a pretty good way to go about things. The way Murderbot describes its interactions with the humans its guarding is especially fascinating, due to the contrast with how Murderbot tosses off descriptions versus what the reader's reconstruction of the scene and awareness of how strange things like abruptly walking away to stare at a corner rather than people would be to the humans around it.\n\nMild spoilers for \"All Systems Red\" follow.\n\nWells uses Murderbot's discomfort with attention, assertion, and being treated as a free agent to pull off a narrative trick that I didn't figure out until the very end. The story is written in 1st person past, but at the very end Murderbot's voice switches abruptly to directly addressing the reader. The whole novella is reframed as a personal message to another of the characters. So Murderbot's been talking about the other characters in 3rd person the entire time while they've been reading about themselves being viewed in 3rd person the whole time. It's a surprising jolt but it makes SO MUCH sense that in trying to explain its very personal motivations for leaving Dr. Mensah and the team, Murderbot would start from a very remote place -- and only at the very end change, when it didn't have any choice, close that distance. It's SO good and so cleverly done.\n\nSpoilers end.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the plot is an excellent intrigue adventure and really clips along.

{"username": "", "date": "2017-12-03", "text": "Aqiul\n84 reviews\n12 followers\nFollow\nDecember 3, 2017\nAll Systems Red is about a half-organic, half-machine security bot that likes to call himself (itself? I don't know) Murderbot. He's managed to hack its governor module which allows him to circumvent or ignore the commands given to it by its owners or contractors. He's a sentient security bot that doesn't have to follow commands but still does so he can get on with life and watch TV shows on the net. Really, just remove the sentient AI part and you can explain his behavior with 'Netflix & apathy'.\n\nAs the story goes, Murderbot has been contracted by a team of survey scientists to help them chart an unknown planet. As the security bot, Murderbot has to make sure all his humans are healthy and alive. The book starts off with a member of the survey team being badly injured by the local fauna and Murderbot saves their life. As more weird incidents start occurring, the survey team realizes that something is wrong with their maps and that all their lives are in danger. The members of the survey team are likable enough, especially Mensah who is the leader of the expedition and Gurathin, an augmented human being who seems to suspect that something is off about their security bot. Very little of actual story covers world building for future books and that's fine by me. We get to see some political and corporate structures of society and get to meet some other security bots who still have functioning governor modules.\n\nThe plot moves quick and I really ended up liking Murderbot. He's got this attitude of 'I don't care' and a really unhealthy dose of pessimism that's just too enjoyable. His character of course got the most attention and he really came out as a complex, likable bot. No one else around him knows about his hacked governor module or the other systems he hacks to avoid detection. He likes to keep his face covered so as to avoid difficult questions from the humans who contract him and he generally just wants to be avoided, do his job and go back to his TV shows at the end of the day. It was very easy to cheer for Murderbot throughout the book and keep hoping no one discovers his secret and takes his freedoms away. The ending felt a bit rushed but it wasn't terrible.\n\nOverall, this was a thoroughly enjoyable book that's easy to recommend for anyone, whether they love science fiction or not.\n\nRead the full review here - Book Review - All Systems Red\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

They are charged with keeping an exploratory expedition alive, as part of a required security package. It calls itself \"murderbot\" - I'm not sure what its official designation was. Despite having broken its governor so the corporation doesn't have absolute control over it still does its assigned job - and seems to have a surprising sense of morality towards its field team given that it comes from a culture where it is owned.\n\nI enjoyed the action, and some of the interactions between the field team and murderbot. There are enough hints of an interesting world to explore further that I look forward to reading the rest of these when they come out, and am interested to see whether it develops into a series that's a \"fun romp\" or \"deeper social commentary\".\nLike\nComment"}

But things go wrong and it must work with the humans to survive, even when they discover its secret. Murderbot is incredibly endearing, and I like the human characters. It's fun seeing the world through Murderbot's eyes, and you just want to hug it, even though you know it'll just make it really uncomfortable and shy. The plot is interesting and fun.

When you call yourself Murderbot, it’s not surprising that you find it difficult to connect with humans. Murderbot is a Security Unit; it handles the security and guards the crew during missions. All units should have a governor chip that keeps them in line and forces them to follow orders. Murderbot disabled theirs. When they should be offline, Murderbot streams their favourite tv shows.\n\nThe novel focuses on the investigation as machinery and other security units start breaking down on the planet. Areas of the map are missing and another group of scientists have gone radio silent. The intrigue and the investigation into the mechanical sabotage should have had a greater impact on the story. The plot kept twisting away from involving the Company which I never understood. When the saboteurs are revealed, there was no weight or emotion to it.\n\nEven though the novel is written in first person, there is never a complete sense of Murderbot. It’s explains that it has cloned human tissue and mechanical parts, but you never get a sense of what the unit looks like. Murderbot is uncomfortable with humans and emotions, prefering to keep their armor and helmet on or just facing away from the people they’re talking to. But as we learn more about Murderbot’s history, there’s not enough depth to connect with the emotions of the situations. This would be fine, if the novel didn’t want to have it both ways.\n\nWith the one-off lines about clones, robot slavery, freed robots, and caretakers, it’s clear that there’s a much more interesting world just underneath the surface of the novel. I wish the plot and Murderbot had skimmed deeper. I’m looking forward to reading the next installment of The Murderbot Diaries and seeing if the worlding building expands to greater depths.\n\nreviewed-by-rebecca\n5 likes\nLike\nComment"}

For the self-styled Murderbot of Martha Wells \"All Systems Red\", a SecUnit (security robot) who lacks the full autonomy the privileged class (in this case, humans) enjoy, the coveting of its private self is not just a way to stay sane, but a way to remain alive and employed. Its internal monologue expresses a deep cynicism and flippant attitude toward its human employers – an emotional defense mechanism if ever there was one – even as it admits to itself that it likes most of the humans it is trying to avoid connecting with. From the start we are told that Murderbot has hacked its “governor” – a deeply flawed piece of regulatory software that ensures its adherence to protocol – and could conceivably go on an indiscriminate murder spree whenever it wants. It doesn’t, though, because like most of us it just wants to watch tv serials and not be hunted down and destroyed by angry humans who don’t want to be murdered. So Murderbot performs its duties protecting the scientific survey team it was assigned to, faithful to the programming it doesn’t technically have to adhere to anymore in order to jealously guard its secret self – until protecting the team and keeping its secret become incompatible.\nLest you think this is just a cerebral character study about living with double consciousness, let me assure you that it is mostly made up of robot battles and bullets shredding things and shit blowing up – its thinkiness is an important complimentary component of the whole, but far from the whole itself.

The fast pace and unique world-building make this an entertaining read, but the characters are the ones who steal the show. Told from Murderbot’s POV, the story is filled with action, snarky humor, and one bot’s quest to find himself.\n\nMartha Wells sets up an engrossing and fun beginning to this series.

Murderbot was a bot who was part human and designed to kill. However, it didn't seem particularly murderous, and was self-aware and endearingly self-conscious. Worldbuilding was sparce, but sufficient - the reader gets an idea of a universe with a complicated system of planetary explorations and especially their funding. Murderbot is protecting one such exploration when things go wrong and it actually has to start paying attention to the people it's protecting instead of the endless stream of tv-programmes it likes to watch. Despite the small length, the story was well-rounded and interesting, and the open ending calls for reading the next book.\nLike\nComment"}

But you'll like it. It's both action-packed and thought-provoking. It's a serious story, told with a touch of humor. The main character is intriguing... though I'll admit the ancillary (heh) characters are kind of boring.

What ekes it just beyond a 3.5 (and where I would have marked it as 3 stars) is the narration from the Murderbot. It sounds basically like an introverted and/or socially maladjusted human, haha (and yes, it is funny). The story of its sentience and reluctant but undeniable choice to protect its human \"clients\" is wrapped around a mystery, which keeps things moving but also kinda isn't the point. It's all leading up to that philosophical twist of an end, which serves as a nice stopping place if you choose, or a lead-in to further stories. Which I'm excited to see are coming - I'll definitely read. I look forward to learning more about Murderbot's past and future choices.\nnovella\n \npurchased-discount-or-free\n \nsff\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The humans he has been contracted to protect are in trouble, helping them means they find out he's operating outside normal parameters.

It's about a misanthropic, deeply introverted, asocial, and severely sarcastic Security Bot, an android rented out to survey teams on alien planets by the insurance company covering liability for the expeditions. It has hotwired itself to disable its governor module, leaving it free to do as it pleases. This mostly involves referring to itself as Murderbot in the privacy of its own head, pretending its still a good, properly functioning SecBot, while doing as little work as possible, and especially while avoiding having to interact with the humans of the survey crew, and spending as much time as possible watching soap operas and other entertainments its covertly downloaded in its downtime.\n\nThe surveys are done on dangerous, unexplored planets. Dramatic hijinks ensue.\n\nThe book is funny, while having pretty strong characterization. A fun, funny action-adventure romp.\nLike\nComment"}

I just recently read Wells full-length Murderbot novel (Network Effect) and it was just the thing to help lift my spirits during this time of uncertainty amidst a global crisis. So now I've decided to reread the entire novella series (which BTW - TOR- you should publish all together).\n\nI love that \"Murderbot\" really just wants to be left alone so it can figure itself out and watch serials (soap operas and whatnot). And although it is scornful of humans, or so it says, it secretly cares for them going out of its way to protect them. You see \"Murderbot\" is actually a SecUnit (a security cyborg) accompanying a group of scientists on a distant planet when their mission goes awry. Of course, Murderbot says it rather be alone and says it doesn't care much for the human scientists, but it just can't help itself when it comes to solving a case and protecting its precious cargo: i.e. its precious humans.\n\nJust don't tell Murderbot what to do or ask it what it wants.\naction\n \nalex-awards\n \nalexawardwinner\n \n...more\nLike\nComment"}

They’re not well equipped and they’re not very clever, but they’ll rip themselves apart to protect their clients.\n\nWell, most of the time.\n\nMurderbot is different. Murderbot hacked their governor module and is a free agent pretending to still be enslaved. All Murderbot has to fear is someone noticing - in which case they’ll be junked for parts, at best - so it’s best if Murderbot keeps its head down and gets on with doing the half-assed job everyone expects it to do.\n\nBut these humans are nicer than most, and Murderbot is developing feelings. Which is awkward, because this planet seems pretty keen to kill them all.\n\nThis was a delight until the climax, which felt weirdly under written - I want to think it was Murderbot’s acute anxiety getting in the way of it relating the tale, but honestly it just felt a bit rough and rushed out. Which is a shame, as it means I ended a story that had been a sheer delight feeling a little awkward myself.\n\nBut I’ll be back for the sequel.\n\nSlightly fuller review\n\n...I originally gave this 3.5 stars because the ending didn't quite work for me, but it has stayed with me so it's getting a bump to a full 4 stars.

They have been supplied for their journey by the Company, including a hub, medical and food supplies, emergency beacons, and a security droid- all the standard safety equipment mandated for any spacefaring journey. Their droid unit, however, is anything but standard, having hacked its own governor module early into the trip. It refers to itself as “Murderbot” (though never out loud), disdains human and their tedium, and would really prefer to be left alone to find out who it is and watch tv. Then partway into the research trip, systems begin to slyly malfunction and a nearby scientific mission goes dark. It’s up to the scientist and their Murderbot to figure out what’s going on before it’s too late.\n\nI really, really loved this novella up until the last ten pages. The droid narrator is pessimistic, an endless fount of dry humor, and really a clever study in “human” nature and the ethics of contracting services from partial-organic lifeforms. The humor in this story wasn’t quite laugh-out-loud, but it shocked some chuckles out of me along the way. The story is really interesting as well, a good space mystery mixed with an interesting scientific system that questions the value of mass-produced, cost-effective equipment and security. The ending, however… too fast, and too rushed. It didn’t finish the story very satisfactorily or even in the same vein as the rest of the book. The main plotline is left to the unknown, and the previously passive droid narrator suddenly makes some strong choices that feel somewhat out of character. I would recommend this book to everyone that loves a quirky space novel with an equally quirky narrator- maybe just skip the last ten pages, and be happy imagining your own ending to this otherwise stellar novella.\nbooks-from-2017\nLike\nComment"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. I was also still doing my job, on a new contract, and hoping Dr. Volescu and Dr. Bharadwaj finished their survey soon so we could get back to the habitat and I could watch episode 397 of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon.\n\nHow can you not be intrigued by this entertainment loving security droid who calls itself Murderbot? Comedy, consciousness, autonomy, and privacy play a key role in this vivid outer space drama centering around a human/robot hybrid. Murderbot gets nervous, often doesn't care, and when it does manage to care, it's a pessimist.\n\nWhat's not to love? Other than, like all short stories, it left me wanting more. Absolutely cannot wait to read the rest of the series. There are three more books coming out this year, Artificial Condition (The Murderbot Diaries, #2), Rogue Protocol (The Murderbot Diaries, #3), and Exit Strategy (The Murderbot Diaries, #4).\n\nYes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\n2018\n \nspace-related\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The crew she's tasked with defending is actually a pretty decent one, and the situation into which they are all thrust is creepy and fucked up. Murderbot's commentary always feels on point, and I loved her more than I should have (Murderbots, or okay fine, Sec Units, are genderless, but I can't help but think of the main character as a 'she').\n\nAt any rate, I'd love more from Murderbot.\nshameless-fangirl\nLike\nComment"}

A story about a sensitive, self-aware security robot that has hacked itself and that gets involved in solving a mystery/conspiracy while serving a scientific planetary survey team. The robot calls itself Murderbot and watches TV shows/serials as much as it can in the downtime. It wants to protect its clients but it also has hang-ups and anxieties that you might associated with an introverted person. The book starts off very abruptly with no back story but I think that works in its favor. It is rather short so more like a short story or novella.

This ended up being a pleasantly light novella about a protection robot (who calls himself \"Murderbot\" in his head) who ends up protecting a survey crew, who, unlike his previous clients, treats him like a human. I love that Murderbot is painfully introverted and enjoys bingeing soap opera vids.\nsci-fi\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The story flew well, with some twists and dangers, and the fact Murderbot was a combat bot helped a lot to give life to the action scenes. I really enjoyed its personality and the way it was written, I found it funny at some points and liked to see how it struggled with its feelings. The secondary characters weren't really developed (it's a short book), but their interactions with Murderbot were enough to picture their preoccupations or emotions. It had some of the social/crew side that I love in Becky's Wayfarers, so I was pleased to see this trend in another scifi series. I'll read the next volume for sure.\n0-250p\n \nin-colors\n \nsci-fi\n \n...more\n7 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I also like universes that feel like the sort of things that humans, in all of our short-sightedness, would build. Star Wars was novel in part because it was a sci-fi universe with fancy tech, but it was also grimy and lived-in; similarly, a universe where we invent cloning and advanced neural interfaces but skimp on safety measures to cut costs feels very real.\n\nI also like it when sci-fi doesn't feel like the stakes need to be universe-scale. Don't get me wrong; I do like a lot of works where empires fall and galaxies tremble and the like. But I also like it when a story has enough confidence to say \"all that's at risk here is these few characters, but that's enough because you like them.\"\n\n\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

I wasn’t really enjoying myself because everything from the characters to their actions felt quite honestly grimy and distasteful to me.\n\nWhen I picked up “All Systems Red” based off the glowing reviews I’d read on GR, I realised right off the bat, that this pleasant feeling i was getting, was what would have helped me finish “Autonomous”. I liked Murderbot and how relatable it was, i liked the crew and how their interactions with the bot were written, this and the fast-paced tone, added to the enjoyability factor while reading the novella.\n\nThe ending, though didn’t quite stick as smoothly as I would have liked but considering there are follow-ups to this book, i'll be on the look-out for what’s in-store for Murderbot and co.\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "2018-01-22", "text": "Annye Driscoll\nAuthor \n4 books\n10 followers\nFollow\nJanuary 22, 2018\nI put off reading All Systems Red because I somehow got the idea that it was a humorous hard sc-fi novel. I’m not a huge fan of humor in my novels and hard sci-fi takes a lot of effort for me, so despite a ton of glowing reviews I remained unexcited about it.\n\n\n\n\nWell it turns out I was way wrong about even the basic structure of the book. Yes, it does have some levity in it, but it’s hardly hard sci-fi. It’s a novella, a page-turner, and very easy to read. Best of all, it’s more of a character-study than the murder android parody I was expecting.\n\nAll this to say – All Systems Red was a spectacular surprise.\n\nThe main character, Murderbot themself, is an absolute joy to have as a PoV character. They are funny, yes, but they’re also dealing with some serious mental shit, considering they’re an android – at times it feels like an anxiety disorder, at other times Autism, and a few times just good old fashioned introversion.\n\nAnd there is a wonderful story complementing the character study: an action-packed little mystery that lightens the novella and adds serious dimension to Murderbot.\n\nI am so glad I picked up All Systems Red despite my apparent complete misunderstanding of what it actually is: a gripping sci-fi action blended with a beautiful and highly entertaining character study.\nfavorites\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}
