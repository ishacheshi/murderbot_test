It's a simple plot and the entire action is described from the perspective of a bored robot tasked with caring for a group of scientists on an unexplored planet. The robot finds it difficult to interact with people, to understand their motives, while at the same time slowly developing a genuine care and affection towards its fragile humans. This is like reading about a feral cat: only there because it has to be there, hates everyone, wants to be left alone, except wait maybe not everything is SO bad.

At best, it reads like fanfiction, yet I've read plenty of fanfiction that works much harder at being entertaining than this.\n\nI thought Murderbot (both the character and the book) was supposed to be unique, quirky, droll.

It’s a must-read if you enjoy sci-fi that makes you think about AI consciousness.

I can see why it’s one of the Goodreads recommended reads this year.

Despite its newfound freedom, Murderbot prefers to binge-watch media and avoid human interaction. However, it's stuck with a team of scientists on a survey mission on a distant planet.

This is a great introduction novella which provides enough information regarding society and technology to not be confusing but not too much to become too technically dense. Our Murderbot main character is a socially awkward, exasperated and reluctant participant in his job who would rather be laying in his cubicle watching tv than dealing with those around him #relatable. Gives Andy Weir vibes for those who enjoy his writing style and humor.\nLike\nComment"}

The world set up with a crew of a ship that seems like a bunch of Millennials overly concerned with their feelings and a Murderbot looking a lot like a Gen Xer trying not to murder them for being so overly sensitive.

It became uncannily easy to understand the machine's thought processes and choices and root for the seemingly cold, distant machine designed to murder.\nTurns out the metal assassin you're flying with isn't calculating how to murder you, but disassociating and trying to watch their stories on the work hour.\n\nThis was a witty, fast-paced, intriguing, and action packed sci-fi story that was able to trust the audiences with their characters and plot without any filler, extraneous exposition, or dizzying world building.\n\nAn infinitesimal, personal complaint about the audiobook...almost wished the reader was British. Hearing an American voice say \"solicitor\" when referring to lawyers and legal aides took me out of the story MUCH easier than it should have.

Nothing but a teenage overly dramatic drama queen of an android filled with nothing but self-pity and only capable of whinging for more than half the book. the prose was garbage until chapter 5 (just over half the book! it's only 8 chapters!) when the fucking irritating android finally started talking to people and not just crying in its fucking beer. the only decent chapters were 5, 6 and 7 and they weren't good. the ending, chapter 8, was so abrupt, hamfisted, stupid and incredibly lazy. I was shocked. absolutely shocked it had ended worse than it started. Clearly the author was asleep at the wheel for 4 whole chapters, snorted a pound of cocaine to power through 3 more chapters and ran outer printer paper so she cranked out the ending on half a sheet of paper while hallucinating on salvia and speed! Clearly her publishing deadline was in 10 ten minutes or less effort would have been put in. Dear friend who asked me to read this because it's a favorite...

I actually think I liked the TV version better because they elaborated more on Sanctuary Moon. I still really enjoyed the book though. Only reason for 4 stars is it was hard to follow for me. I am new to Sci Fi books, but I didn’t get a clear picture as to who the ‘company’ was, plus other terms like the all the different Hubs or the little pod they were traveling in. Sometimes I almost felt like he went one way of thinking and then backtracked to before that thought and I got confused a couple of times and had to re-read some pages. Also, what were the humans doing on that planet, and what were they searching for? Why did Murderbot kill those people before he got reprogrammed? I needed more details, and that’s why I liked the show because it filled in some of the gaps for me, and I would have been way more lost if I hadn’t seen it. I loved Murderbot’s personality though.

(I assess the threat)\nWe execute the plan. (In three long corporate cycles.)\nWe move on.\nAnd yes, most of the time, the threat is human behavior.\n\nThen it’s over.

Murderbot is a rogue security robot who has overridden his programming to allow himself to make decisions of his own, and most importantly, watch TV and movies. He literally wants nothing more than to be left alone and to not have to deal with humans, which is ironic seeing as his exact job is to protect humans that he is assigned to. He finds emotions annoying, admits to half assing work, thinks humans are dumb and has funny commentary on all the little social routines/oddities humans all do for the sake of pleasantry and going through the motions.\n\nThis book also had a crazy amount of plot and world building for a novella! Super fun tech, lots of action and I would definitely see myself continuing the series on car trips.\n\nIs it a crazy stand out impressive story?

I loved the concept, and I can absolutely see why so many people adore Murderbot as a character.\n\nThat said, the execution didn’t fully work for me. The novella format felt too short for the amount of worldbuilding and emotional depth I wanted. Things moved quickly, but not in a way that kept me hooked—instead, I was often waiting for the story to really start. Murderbot’s voice is clever and funny, but I didn’t quite connect enough to feel fully invested in the stakes.\n\nStill, I’m curious to see where the series goes and will be continuing it—Murderbot’s unique perspective has me intrigued enough to give the next installment a try.\n\nA 2-star read for me: interesting ideas and moments of humor, but ultimately not quite as immersive as I hoped.\n\n✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧\nLike\nComment"}

I saw exactly zero redeeming qualities within its pages.\n\nMurderbot wasn't funny or charming, but rather just sort of lazy and anxious. At no point did I care about the events on that planet. Let's break down the entire story: some greedy buggers tried to kill the main characters, murderbot was there. Then it's all over. I had the beginnings of a glimmer of caring when I thought the crew would not trust MB after they learned more about him. But, no, that wasn't a problem.\n\nToo many characters! No idea how many, it boiled down to the boss and the guy MB didn't like. And all the rest.\n\nLet me tell you about the universe where this all happens. Well, there is a corporation and it's cheap. That's about all we know.\n\nThe prose is godawful. \"I walked here. I picked up something. I walked there.\"\n\nThis book is freakishly popular, and I just don't get it.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-09", "text": "READERSBEWARE\n171 reviews\nFollow\nDecember 9, 2025\nReading All Systems Red felt like slipping into the mind of someone who’s already given up on being understood. Murderbot’s voice is sardonic, numb, and strangely heartbreaking — a creature built for violence, wired for obedience, yet quietly desperate to disappear into the comforting static of its media feeds. The isolation hits hardest: it moves through the world surrounded by people it’s meant to protect, yet it never believes it belongs beside them. That loneliness, wrapped in humor sharp enough to border on self-defense, makes the story feel less like sci-fi adventure and more like a confession from someone who never asked to exist.\n\nWhat lingers isn’t the danger the characters face but the way Murderbot constantly assumes the worst of itself. Every time it steps between humans and harm, there’s this sense of weary inevitability — like it’s bracing for the moment its usefulness runs out. Its internal monologue reads like someone trying to shrink out of their own story, terrified of being seen, yet unable to stop caring in the small, reluctant ways that hurt the most. Even when the plot accelerates into tense survival, that low thrum of self-loathing never really fades; it just hides under the action beats.\n\nBy the end, the book doesn’t offer comfort so much as a grim acknowledgment of what it means to keep going when connection feels dangerous and identity feels like a wound. The story is short, almost brutally so, and it leaves you with the sense that Murderbot’s journey is far from healing — it’s merely the first step of someone who knows freedom won’t magically make them whole. And maybe that’s what makes this little novella so quietly devastating: beneath the armor, the algorithms, and the dry humor, Murderbot feels painfully human in its desire to stay unseen… and its inability to stop caring anyway.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

I can see why it was made into a TV show, especially with the rise of AI in the world and with good reasoning, because this story was a blast.\nLike\nComment"}

It prefers staying behind its mask or talking through cameras rather than making eye contact with its human clients. Its uncomfortable talking and interacting with them and prefers to stay in its room watching TV shows. Unlike other units of its type, it does not need to obey commands thanks to it hacking its governor module.\n\nUnfortunately, it would seem someone does not want them on that planet. Its an intriguing premise and good character. However, it was a little grating reading through all the self-deprecating jokes and mild sarcasm.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-23", "text": "Bree Hatfield\n406 reviews\n3 followers\nFollow\nDecember 6, 2025\nThis novella felt like a spin-off story in a much larger series — the world is fully developed and richly realized, and the audience is just expected to get it. I felt like I understood about 75% of what was going on most of the time. I know that was an intentional choice, but it’s not one I like very much. I prefer it when I get to discover the world as the story progresses.\n\nMinor spoilers ahead.\n\nThe other major problem was that every character except for Murderbot was cardboard. None of them had any distinguishable personalities, and I could barely tell them apart. I slowly began to parse their individual identities by the end, but then Murderbot leaves them. So what was the point? Murderbot’s declaration that Mensah was his favorite human at the end just rang hollow.\n\nFor this whole novel, we’re in Murderbot’s head. Martha Wells is very good at portraying his internal struggle and development, and Murderbot’s character arc is what drives this novella and makes it worth reading. BUT, I think that’s also why the other characters fell so flat. Clearly Wells is good at characterization, but with such a strict point of view, she constricts herself.\n\nBecause of the lack of visible character development for the human characters, the actual plot fell extremely flat for me too. Why should I care about what’s going on with the weird planet when Murderbot doesn’t? The climax is somewhat interesting, but only because Murderbot has a personal stake in it.\n\nMurderbot also warms up to the humans VERY quickly. At the start, they don’t care about the crew at all, but about an hour in they’re extremely protective of them? It didn’t make much sense. I think the idea is that these humans are the first to show genuine compassion toward them, which is great in concept, except that Murderbot previously stated that they didn’t care what the humans thought of them at all. This is part of a much larger issue, though; this novella should have been a full-length novel. Just about every aspect of this book needed more elaboration and more development.\n\nMurderbot is very relatable, very funny, and extremely compelling. I absolutely love their arc in this book — they learned that to truly find yourself, you need compassion and determination. Mensah and her crew showed them compassion, and because of that they had the determination to do what was good. They still don’t know who they are, but they know what it means to be sentient. And that is a beautiful character arc, which sets up their further development wonderfully.\n\nAnd in a way, this could be interpreted as a story about how powerful fiction is and the impact it has on the psyche. Murderbot learns a lot about how to live well by watching media. The issue is that we don’t get much of any description of the media they watch, but still. It’s nice.\n\nThis was a good book, but not quite as good as everyone says. After watching the show, it’s abundantly clear that this novella needed to be a novel; all the elements of greatness are here (interesting characters, fun plot, emotional character arcs, etc.), but Wells basically speed-runs the whole story in 150 pages. If it was 200 pages longer, it would have been a masterpiece. As it is, it’s just okay.\n\nAlso, the constant use of “it” as a single pronoun felt so odd to me. Even after the crew found out that Murderbot was sentient, they still used “it.” This is a queer-normative world, just use “they”! I know Murderbot doesn’t care, but Murderbot isn’t a thing. They’re a person. Use a pronoun that befits a person. Also, why the hell would he choose “Murdebot” as a name? Just because it’s funny? If that is the reason, why wouldn’t they change their name at the end of the story once they have a more serious view of their own sentience? It just doesn’t make much sense.\n2025\n \nqueer\n \nscience-fiction\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-04", "text": "Sara Seyfarth\nAuthor \n1 book\nFollow\nDecember 4, 2025\nI love science fiction, and I see mentions of this series all the time, so I’m not sure why it took me so long to read it. I definitely had the perception that it would be fairly dark, so maybe it was that. At any rate, it was completely different from what I was anticipating.\n\nMy biggest issue, frankly, is the length, and that’s really only to say that I enjoyed it enough that I wished it were longer. I went into it not realizing it was written as a novella, so that likely colored my reaction. The world-building is really interesting, but it does feel introductory. The world we’re presented with is pretty dark – this is a system with very little care or empathy (on an uninhabited planet, there’s an expectation that equipment is poorly made) and there are references to deeply questionable treatment of the not-entirely-human – but my understanding of the world is pretty limited, and I’m left with a lot of questions. Since this is a series, I’m happy that I’ll get to dive back into this world and learn more.\n\nThis is a really fun, quick read that made me laugh out loud multiple times, which I wasn’t expecting. The tone is everything here. Murderbot is a new favorite character; its voice is delightfully droll and its thought processes are interesting, concrete, and at times, hilarious. The characterization, for me, steals the spotlight because Wells manages to balance Murderbot’s humor with its tragic background and place in the world. I love that the novella is thought-provoking without feeling preachy or pulling the reader from the story while also delivering some great comedy.\n\nPerhaps because I listened to this on audio, I did have some difficulty with keeping the rest of the characters straight. They were all well imagined, and by the end I felt I knew a few, but I would have liked some additional development so they all felt clearer earlier in the story.\n\nThis was also a really quick read (so quick that I verified twice that I hadn’t inadvertently chosen the abridged audiobook before realizing that it’s a novella 😂), and the plot moved at warp speed. I love a fast-moving story, but again I felt some additional development wouldn’t have gone awry. The mystery was solved in a fairly mundane way when I’d hoped there would be a little more to it. The ending also felt a little rushed.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this one and look forward to reading more in the series.\naudio\n \nscience-fiction\nLike\nComment"}

So as a science fiction “occasionalist,” I decided to give this book a go in audiobook format during a long, end of summer road trip.\n\nI know this too is sacrilege to say, even for me, but… I think I liked the show better? The show really leaned into and fleshed out the society from which the humans Murderbot is assigned to protect come, and paint it as an absurdist inevitable conclusion of centuries of political correctness. Kind of hilarious, and glossed over, for the most part, in the book. Plus, I know this is not a fair comparison, but whoever was the reader of the audiobook? Well, he’s no Alexander Skarsgård.

On the one hand, I really enjoyed almost every aspect of it. I liked the world, I liked the characters, I liked the prose. The mystery was really cool, and I liked learning about the world through the POV character’s eyes, though I feel the POV is the ultimate downfall of the story. I get that the main character is fundamentally disinterested in a lot of what goes on in the world, but I just needed more details. I wanted to know more about the previous incident that made them the way they are. This element hangs over the first half of the narrative, supposing to be some mysterious inciting event, but is revealed and discussed in its entirety in about two sentences. The ongoing mystery throughout had such cool potential, but again is revealed with no fanfare or further discussion. The reveal didn’t even really seem all that important. I’m given the facts of why I should care about these things, but the way they are presented had almost no emotional impact on me. And yet, despite all these critiques, I really liked the book! I’m frustrated because I think these characters and this world is way cooler than the book makes it out to be. I found the end unsatisfying and too open, but in a way that all but guarantees I’ll be picking up the next book. I’m left with a lot of questions, but that in itself kind of has kept the story on my mind more than other books with a watertight narrative. The book is pretty short and punchy, but I wanted a bit more character study out of it, even if that meant the book needed to be longer. I always think wanting more book at the end of a book is a good criticism to have, because I was enjoying it! I think the fact that I did end up enjoying it so much despite the major parts I found lacking is a testament to how cool this world is, and how cool these characters are.\nLike\nComment"}

The world is pretty well developed and I really love the characters, especially Murderbot. He is funny and relatable despite being a robot - all he wants to do is watch TV and not interact with humans, yet he feels an unexplainable motivation to protect and serve humans. It was a page turner the entire way through, despite me not reeeally caring about the plot; I’m just here for vibes! There’s still hints of a fun plot, setting, and themes, but again not deep given it’s a novella. Themes hint on not punishing the whole for the actions of a small portion, exploring why we are motivated to be good even to those we owe nothing to, and simply being anti-social and not wanting to be observed or controlled by others. I will definitely continue this series to keep hearing from Murderbot!\n\nCharacters: 4.5 ⭐️\nSetting: 4 ⭐️\nPlot: 3 ⭐️\nThemes: 3 ⭐️\nEmotional Impact: 2 ⭐️\nPersonal Enjoyment: 4 ⭐️\nTotal Rounded Average: 4 🌟\nLike\nComment"}

Really nice read to pass the time.\n\nMurderbot's awkwardness and internal monologue kept me hooked, and the overall world-building and storyline was interesting. It’s crazy to be considering a freaking sci-fi novel as a comfort read, but for now (now being before I finish the rest of the series) it seems like it; no stake too heavy, with an adorkable MC and an enjoyable plot.\n\nI don't really have super strong complaints; nothing irked me to the point of oh wow I wanna drop this book. All aspects of the story were fun, but nothing was riveting; nothing felt deep or meaningful. I also considered, since we're reading Murderbot's internal dialogue, perhaps the author could have brought up certain issues/themes relevant to its complex situation and role. But all Murderbot wants is to watch TV (it doesn't care enough about anything really. I guess it's one of its charms, why so many people like this series).\n\nMy biggest dissatisfaction; perhaps it's due to the shortness of the novella, but there wasn't enough room for me to become fully invested in the rest of the characters (minus Murderbot) or the story itself. Ex) I wasn't really worried about the threats that our characters faced (I didn't care enough about them, idk); more so anticipated Murderbot's humorous narrations facing social anxiety. Hopefully this is something that will be resolved as I read the rest of the series.\n\nBut overall, this was a fast, fun read I could enjoy without using too much brainpower. Like a quick, sweet snack between huge gourmet meals that allows me to rest my stomach for a while (= rest my brain). A potential comfort read (like I said, that’s crazy for a sci-fi novel).\nLike\nComment"}

I did enjoy the main character’s hilarious blend of cynicism and social awkwardness.\nThe plot itself moves quickly and wraps up in a satisfying way. Honestly, one of the things I appreciated most was the length. After trudging through several 500+ books lately, this felt refreshingly concise. The pacing is fast—sometimes very fast—but it works because it feels like we’re experiencing events in real time through the MC’s point of view.\nThat said, the brevity comes with a cost: zero relationship development and almost no characterization for the supporting cast. I often found myself forgetting who was who, simply because the book doesn’t spend much time fleshing them out.\nLike\nComment"}

I think my only complaint is she started to lose me with some of the technical detail in the last act, but mostly I found it really cool and I appreciate how all the sci-fi elements are genuinely relevant to the plot and mystery.

It distracts from the main plot and character building and tad, even if the sole purpose is merely an odd hack at speculative science fiction and cultural world-building. For me, it immediately makes almost all the characters unrelatable. Perhaps robotic in a twist of irony.\nLike\nComment"}

Socially awkward reluctant hero and his granola(but surprisingly formidable) scientist found family band together to save the day. Wells is incredibly economical with language, yet the relationships feel complete and alive, especially the quiet, affecting bond between Dr. Mensah and Murderbot. I found the “robot-attains-consciousness” theme more timely than ever; there’s so much conversation about bad singularity, and less about a neutral or humane one. This novella hits that middle ground beautifully.\n\nA few things didn’t land as well: the hybrid organic–mechanical body concept could be clearer(Murderbot can feel pain sort of(?), bleed, regrow like I lizard does it's tail-- I found all this difficult to picture); some background crew members blurred together, and I wish their dialogue had been further reduced to keep focus on the ones with stronger ties to the main character.\n\nStill, every now and then I want a good space thriller and this absolutely scratched the itch.\nLike\nComment"}

I mostly picked it up because it gave me vague Halo and Ready Player One vibes. Turns out it was more of a Detriot: Become Human and maybe Divergent mash-up vibes. In other words, I fucking loved this book! Also, the audiobook is read by my favorite narrator, so that was a huge plus too!\n\nI loved Murberbot's personality! The name of the game for Murderbot was Escapism and I felt that in my soul. Murderbot is just a mix of \"I'm-so-done-with-everyone's-bullshit\", \"I-just-want-my-book/TV\", and \"I-couldn't-care-less-if-I-tried\"; and I loved it so much.

I've found out that I'm the opposite: fantasy books are natural to me, but apparently I struggle with sci-fi even if the book is short like this one.\n\nIt's not that the book is complicated or that the world is complex, and it certainly isn't my first sci-fi book (although I don't read that many). It's just that I think I'm not that interested in sci-fi settings and the terminology and concepts are not as natural to me, especially considering that this is a super short book and, therefore, very focused on the action.\n\nThings are happening, people and robots are using systems with names like HubSystem and SecSystem and they're communicating through feeds that they can share or block and then there are guns coming out of a robot's arms and scanners and drones and hoppers and some are small and some are big and then the autopilot is malfunctioning and there's a system breach and suddenly my eyes are glazed over and I'm just reading words.\n\nThe book itself was nice and entertaining and Murderbot is a great main character (although his awkwardness was a bit too much at times) and I somewhat enjoyed the fact that it is such a small book as it kept things focused, but also I somehow took way too long to read this because I wasn't fully immersed or invested.\n\nAll in all, I liked it and I think I'll read the next books as they are all so short, but I think sci-fi is still a bit of a struggle for me.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”\n\nDespite enjoying several sci-fi tv shows, I’ve never been particularly drawn to reading the genre. Having said that, The Murderbot Diaries have been on my radar for years, so when I realised All Systems Red fit the prompt for a reading challenge the choice was easy.\n\nAll Systems Red is the first in the series of novellas by Martha Wells (that will number 8 when Platform Decay is released in May 2026) introducing a hybrid organic android who calls itself Murderbot.\n\nOwned by The Company, Murderbot is one of dozens of ‘SecUnits’, deployed to protect people or property, or kill and destroy the same, as management decrees. Murderbot however, is different. After a system malfunction that resulted in the unsanctioned slaughter of fifty seven clients, Murderbot (who adopted the name as a result), hacked their own system, and secretly severed The Company’s control.\n\nAs the story opens, Murderbot, who keeps up the pretence of their programming lest The Company order their destruction, is accompanying a small group of non-profit scientists assessing the value of a planet’s resources. The mission is entirely uneventful until suddenly it’s not, and Murderbot is pulling a scientist from the mouth of a tunnelling carnivorous monster, sparring with a batch of hijacked SecUnits, faking out unscrupulous rival surveyors, and having to spend way too much time with humans when they’d much rather be watching Sanctuary Moon.\n\nBuoyed by perfect pacing, it took me barely an hour to read All Systems Red. The action is fast-paced, the world simply portrayed, and Murderbot is immediately appealing.\n\nCynical and stoic yet awkward and vulnerable, Murderbot has a surprisingly complexity. I enjoyed how the dynamic between Murderbot and the group of humans under his protection further informed his character.\n\nDespite the brevity of the novella format, Wells raises questions about identity, autonomy, and humanity, all with a delightfully deadpan sense of humour.\n\nAn entertaining and easy read I’m eager to devour the rest of the Murderbot Diary series and watch the recently released Murderbot series on AppleTV+.\n2025-challenges\n6 likes\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-11-23", "text": "Cat\n61 reviews\nFollow\nNovember 23, 2025\nFinally got to read this after watching the tv show. I love the snark, Dr. Mensah, and the poly-normative world. Murderbot’s internal dialogue felt stilted and the more robotic parts not well integrated with the emotional sides. Which while consistent with the character’s growth, didn’t quite land for me. It was a bit too jarring. So, a novella! From little I’ve gathered, Wells got to lead the new tv series, and I think all the additions to smooth out and extend the story were fantastic there. It fascinated me that there was almost no description of any character’s appearance beyond clothing. It took me until the end to realize, when I realized I’d been hearing the actors voices and had no idea if they matched their physical descriptions. It left me wondering what I would have assumed if I read this without the tv show to fill in the gaps.\n\nI’ve been reading a lot of books with ASD coded characters, but they tend to have pretty mild presentation. Murderbot is more in the moderate range. “So you don’t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.” We’re left wondering which things are coping mechanisms it’ll grow out of and which are intrinsic. The contrast with Gurathin, who also seems mild ASD here (but more traumatized in the show) was also intriguing but didn’t really get off the ground. I really appreciated getting this inside look, and am really curious about the next novellas (and hopefully tv seasons!) in this series.\nLike\nComment"}

Even though I didn’t find Murderbot relatable (I love making eye contact and socializing), its dispassionate narration and love for mindless entertainment easily won me over.\n\nIn my opinion, you have to like Murderbot to like the book. While there are certainly other characters, Murderbot’s prickly charm carries the story.\n\nWells lays the groundwork for potentially great conversations around capitalism, media consumption, and autonomy, and I’m excited to see where she takes them. The world-building seems promising too, so I will definitely be continuing with the series!\n\nThanks, Lexi https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1... ,for the solid recommendation!\nseal-of-approval\n4 likes\nLike\nComment"}

My primary reading genre is fantasy/high fantasy/romantasy, and so many new authors in this category tend to overwrite their books because they think if their books aren't girthy tomes then they won't be as \"epic\" or have a fleshed out fantasy world. This book is I think only a little over 100 pages (I read the audiobook so it was only 3 hours as opposed to the normal range of 10-20+ hours for many other books I read) and it told such a well-crafted story. I also never thought I would be relating to a character who calls itself \"murderbot\" or that said bot would be absolutely hilarious. If you're a sci-fi fan, or need to break a reading slump and need something short and unintimidating but don't want to sacrifice any quality, then absolutely pick this up and fall in love with Murderbot like I did.\nLike\nComment"}

So many people love it, I decided to try one more time with the audio. Listening at 2x speed it only took 1.5 hours, but it felt much longer. I just didn't really care about anything that was happening.\n\nThe story dumps you right in and it takes a minute to get the ins and outs of the world. I spent the first bit feeling confused. There is a fine balance between world overload and not enough information and this book did not reach it. Even by the end I wasn't entirely sure what Murderbot was. It was confusing.\n\nMaybe if I understood the world better, I would've enjoyed this book more. I didn't understand who the people were on this world, what they were doing there, what the villains were trying to protect - it just wasn't that enjoyable because too much information was missing. And I actually love mysteries, but with those there is a logical set up, which includes missing puzzle pieces. This one felt more like one of my 8 year old students trying to tell a complex story and leaving out all kinds of important information but I don't want to ask questions because they story was already going on too long.\n\nI read that some people found Murderbot amusing, but I didn't find him that intriguing. Not really a character that I'd want to know more.

It did not need a romance, which from me is probably saying something. The main character (Murderbot) was interesting to discover; they were shy, quirky and had a lot of feelings about having to interact with humans. Because of this I enjoyed how the supporting characters interacted with Murderbot. I found this was an engaging plot in an expansive world, and there seem to be so many possibilities for places this can go. The ending left me wanting more, I can see how despite not being incredibly invested right now due to the length of the novella, I could become immersed in the series.\nLike\nComment"}

Could have read it in one sitting but felt I didn’t want to rush it. Good enough for what it offers, and I did enjoy the ending enough to want to continue in the series.\n\nIt’s good for those looking to dabble in sci-fi lit for the first time and want something as a manageable comfort read. The pros are rather simple, and might even be a better recommendation for a younger audience.\n\nBut I did struggle to grasp the story at times. I didn’t feel it was always so clear, even with the audiobook accompanying the narration. I also think that having read this while also reading some more “complex” philosophically stimulating books like Asimov’s Foundation (+Dune being a favourite of mine for years now), as well as some non-fiction science books, I often had to remind myself to notice All System’s Red for what it is and avoid treating it as I feel it should be by comparison to other more notable works.\n\nI’m hoping to continue with Artificial Condition with that perspective in mind, and try to remember not to hold it to a different (higher) standard; instead I want to appreciate it for what it is or is trying to do, as a lighter read.\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot talks like an angsty teen on Tumblr, and as someone who was once an angsty teen on Tumblr, I am here for it.\n\nFor the uninitiated, All Systems Red is about a cyborg/robot who names itself Murderbot after secretly hacking into their own government module in order to free itself from its own programming. As a result, it has to learn what it's like to have feelings, like anxiety. It also learns about navigating relationships and just being a sentient, partially-organic being with some degree of free will. All it wants to do is watch bad television and avoid prolonged social interactions, but unfortunately for Murderbot, it's still a security unit (SecUnit). That means it gets assigned guard duty on dangerous missions, so there are serious stakes in this book.\n\nAlso, the fact that Murderbot hacked into their own government module needs to be kept a secret. So it not only has to keep everyone on their mission alive, but also has to act normal. And unfortunately, socially anxious cyborgs aren't the best actors in the world.\n\nWhat ensues is very funny. It also raises important questions about relationships and what it means to be sentient. And underneath that, there's critique of corporate entities, which I imagine will get less subtle in later books. There's an element of both hopepunk and grit in here. Hopepunk, because there are collectivized and democratized planets that have completely reimagined how to organize society without problematic hierarchies, and I imagine we might see more of these societies in later books. But still gritty, because outside those hippy planets, there are corporate overlords worth fighting against.\nLike\nComment"}

En ella, conocemos a Matabot, una Seg-Unidad —un androide creado para proteger a los humanos durante expediciones— que ha hackeado su propio módulo de control para evitar convertirse en una máquina de matar. En vez de obedecer sin cuestionar, dedica su tiempo libre a ver series.\n\nLa historia se desarrolla en un lejano planeta, donde Matabot acompaña a un grupo de científicos. Su misión se complica cuando otro equipo desaparece, lo que obliga a Matabot y sus humanos a investigar el extraño suceso por sí mismos. Pero más allá del misterio sobre el que gira la trama, el verdadero atractivo es el propio Matabot como narrador: su voz interior es sarcástica, cargada de ironía, profundamente introvertida y con una ansiedad social que lo hace sorprendentemente humano y con el que es fácil sentirse identificado.\n\nA pesar de su apariencia letal, Matabot se muestra con muchas inseguridades, dubitativo en su relación con los humanos aunque haya devorado centenares de horas de telenovelas para aprender sus maneras de hacer las cosas.\n\nEsta contradicción entre su potencia física y su vulnerabilidad emocional convierte al personaje en algo más que un simple robot de acción. Además, el relato entra en temas más profundos como el libre albedrío o la identidad, sin perder un ritmo ágil ni su tono irónico. Siendo una novela corta que engancha sin necesidad de grandes giros de guión o escenas repletas de acción.\n\nPor lo que si te interesa una ciencia ficción ligera pero con peso emocional y un androide con crisis existenciales, “Tots els Sistemes en Vermell” es una lectura muy recomendable.\n12 likes\nLike\nComment"}

The pov of murderbot is hilarious and painfully relatable. For just that reason, this book might have become one of my top reads this year. Then the plot comes in and omg if my heartbeat could be recorded as I read this novella, I would present it as evidence in lieu of stating to the court that my ass was CLENCHED about page 20 onwards. The pacing is quick, and while there are breathers, the atmosphere of tension does not let up. I was almost disappointed at the resolution then, until I wasn't— never let them know your next move murderbot, good for you.\nGreat writing just hits different— this was the most enjoyable reading experience of the year for me so far. This succeeded in doing what many pieces of media have failed to do this year: to borrow murderbot's sentiments, distract me when reality was too intrusive.

When another scientific party on the planet goes silent, the AI unit, which calls itself Murderbot, helps the original team investigate. Murderbot would really rather stream action adventures and isolate. However, the unit unwillingly becomes part of the team as they look into what’s happening on the planet and attempt to survive unanticipated threats. This story, told from the Murderbot’s perspective, makes one think about how humanity could be blindly adopting AI without regard to the possible feelings and emotions that “created” tech may eventually have. Hats off to Wells for exploring this topic in such a humorous, yet poignant manner. I can’t wait to read the series’ next novella, Artificial Condition.\nLike\nComment"}

This setup creates a world run by contracted corporations, where safety and information depend on whatever a company chooses to fund. The contrast between the human scientists and Murderbot’s private, self-aware commentary gives the book its appeal.\n\nThe premise is strong: an artificial construct trying to manage human responsibility while avoiding emotional involvement. The pacing is quick, and the action scenes keep the plot moving, but the novella doesn’t explore the planet, the corporation, or Murderbot’s inner conflict in much detail. The result is a light reading experience that hints at bigger ideas without spending much time on them.\n\nThe novella introduced an interesting premise, but its short length keeps the characters, world, and themes at arm’s length.

The non-human main character is a distant outsider but awkward and self-conscious rather than Spock-like, superior, or aloof.

I also got her autograph. This is another book I’ve heard a lot about in the sci-fi community. It was even turned into a TV series on Amazon. The story follows a robot, or really a half robot and half human construct built to murder. Hence the title Murderbot Diaries. Admittedly, it was a rough start for me. I struggled to make sense of who the main character was. It is told in first person, and while it describes itself with robotic and android functions, it sounds incredibly human.\n\nWhich is exactly the point.\n\nIt is an easy short novella. On a distant planet, a group of scientists and their corporate supplied self aware android who calls itself Murderbot conduct tests on the planet’s surface, which seems uninhabited by any sentient beings. But they aren’t alone, and when their neighboring team goes dark, they set out to figure out what happened.\n\nHowever, at the heart of the story is the question of what it truly means to be human. Did NOT expect that ending, and it was perfect.\nLike\nComment"}

A good portion of the page time was spent establishing our narrators personality, since its so lovable and funny that made this a fun read.

I liked getting to mull over what makes one human with a new context to frame a question that comes up many times and in many forms!\n\nThis was an easy read and I read straight through once I picked a time where I felt patient enough to get past the first few pages when I felt lost and not sure where we were headed. Sometimes all the computer and systems stuff felt confusing so I do wish the author had made certain things clearer so we could get more of the strategic moves… But I felt like I didn’t need to think too much about all that and could just let it be without missing a whole lot.

I liked reading about Murderbot and while I might continue the series in the future, I thought that this had a satisfying ending. I am curious if the characters in this book are going to appear in the next books or if each book is going to be a different short story from Murderbot’s life.\n\nRecap if continue the series: \nMurderbot is supposed to be a SecUnit (robot with some human/organic elements) completely controlled by the company through the HubSystem. However, it managed to hack the HubSystem and while it still follows orders of the people it’s hired out to in order to maintain its secret, it prefers watching TV series and not interacting with people. It has started to like the group of scientists it’s with now and it helps them survive while a third party is sending compromised SecUnits to kill the researchers on this planet. Eventually they manage to get out and the scientists (one of which is a political agent) buy Murderbot’s contract so it can live freely on their planet, but it doesn’t believe them and the book ends with Murderbot sneaking out and travelling away from everyone.\n\nSetting: -\nMC names: Murderbot\nPOV: 1st person\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

It's not bad and it definitely does have chuckle-worthy moments, but there is nothing special going on. Even though the story was different, it did make me think about Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It pulled off what All Systems Red tried to with it's humor.\n\nBesides the humor, it didn't help that it just dropped you in the middle somewhere and seemingly seemed to end somewhere too. It gave me the feeling I was reading a couple of chapters within a larger story, without having read those.\n\nAs I said, the book isn't bad, it just didn't do anything special and felt really ordinary.\n\nI will personally not be continuing these.\n3 likes\nLike\nComment"}

Along the way, it finds itself - - horrors! -- actually starting to like humans — at least these particular humans.\n\nThe narrative is a little skimpy on world-building. We get just enough details to know that the story is set in a space-exploring future that is dominated by various corporations, some of them unethical in their methods.\n\nBut that doesn’t really matter, because the focus of the story isn’t the setting but the charmingly snarky main character, who is still trying to decide who it is and what its purpose in the universe should be.\n\nI liked the poignant ending (but also didn’t want it to end and can’t wait to read more books in this series).\n\n\nI don’t know what I want. . . But it isn’t that, it’s that I don’t want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.\n\nThat’s why I left you, Dr. Mensah, my favorite human. By the time you get this I’ll be . . .

Knjiga je precej resnejša in precej bolj z-f, kot sem pričakoval po ogledu prve sezone. Več je tehnoblebeta. Tudi človeški liki imajo v seriji več plastike, več karakterja, v knjigi pa ostanejo kar malo prazni. Bomo videli dalje, saj se je serija tu končala.

The irony that that trip to the library, all of the books I checked out were randomly selected from the shelf (by me) and all ended up being second books in their series so I didn’t read a single one, haha, but kurferbit was excellent.\n\nThe conversational bland writing style was super interesting. It was a puzzle to read, which I liked. Every sentence was like a paragraph. I love books like this (and dune) that have so little exposition that sometimes it’s easy to miss what’s even happening. But then it’s incredibly rewarding when you figure it out.\n\nGreat great book, especially considering how short it is.

Wells drops the reader right into this world and it takes a little bit to get learn about it. However, this book grew on me and I ended up liking it up until the abruptly ends.\n\nThe point of view is a security robot with organic components, they don't really have a favorable viewpoint on humans and care very little for the humans they were assigned to protect. This \"murderbot\", as it refers to itself, has a secret which is a modified programming that it did itself. This modification will help both itself as well as it's human team when an opposing team tries to attack.\n\nI liked the apathy and sassiness of the main character, it made me laugh several times as well as how invested it is in it's shows it likes to watch. I didn't like the beginning or end of the story but the middle made up that I would be interested in reading more books in the series.\naudiobook\nLike\nComment"}

It is all robot made with some organic parts in order to appear and function (in a kinesthetic way) as human. And that was my big hang up: how does an AI entity become sentient? Because Murderbot is that. Perhaps this evolution is explained later in the series. I'll have to read more to find out.\n\nHowever, I was enamored of Murderbot. It was a bit like a teen cloaked in ennui with a sash of disdain who is forced to move outside of its own self-absorption in order to help save its world (in this case, save the humans it is charged with protecting). But I find Murderbot charming. I also find interesting the parallels to robot ownership and human slavery, as explored in this story. I hope that is a running theme as I'd like to see where Ms. Wells takes that.\n\nI didn't read this as comedic. I note it now is a streaming series labeled as comedy. I can maybe see that. Again, the later tales may well be more comedy than the drama shared in All Systems Red.\n\n1 like\n2 comments\nLike\nComment"}

It was just not flowing fluidly for me and I actually found myself getting frustrated and trying to force myself to continue reading when I realized I was at about 30-40% into it and still hadn’t enjoyed a single paragraph.\n\nIt’s possible I’ll revisit it in the future and update my review, but for now I’ll leave it be.\n1 like\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}
{"username": "", "date": "I had heard good things about this series, but had always put it off because a) Murderbot sounds fucking stupid, no matter what the fans say b) I ain't paying full novel price per novella. Then I was able to get the whole series for circa £15 on Humble Bundle, and said I'd better give it a shot.Surprise surprise, I actually really liked it! It's nice to have something enjoyable in the novella length, and I look forward to dipping in and out as needed. A novella is the closest thing literature has to a movie, imo, as a nice yummy satisfying chunk you can eat up in an afternoon. I was a bit worried that this might be a bit too far along the saccharinely sweet LGBTQ neurodivergence spectrum where everyone is unusual in their own special way and they are all really nice and kind and understanding to each other about their differences (looking at you, Becky Chambers), which is not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but is just too much forced positivity for this straight fella to handle. Thankfully, this did not fall to that level - despite having an asexual nonbinary autistic protagonist, the edges have not been filed off the story and it was, y'know, just a good tale featuring some diversity. Murderbot doesn't have proper human rights, and that makes things interesting! It's conflict! A sidenote: whenever I see this recommended, people always say \"let me know whether you think Murderbot is a guy or a girl!\". Well, the new Apple TV cover literally has the robot as a dude on the front, so there was no real room for imagination there for me.I have all (most?) of the sequels, so I am looking forward to reading them when I'm in the mood for more novellas! it's such a wonderful length, I am always happy to have a few stashed away for when 100 pages just scratches the itch. The only problem with then is they often cost as much or more than full novels, so I am quite glad to have dodged that!", "text": "Diarmuid O'Donoghue\n142 reviews\n1 follower\nFollow\nNovember 13, 2025\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\nShow full review\nLike\nComment"}

All Systems Red is tight, clever, and emotionally resonant, with Murderbot’s dry sarcasm masking real depth. The worldbuilding is efficient, the pacing sharp, and the character voice unforgettable. It’s rare to find a sci-fi novella that’s this entertaining while still saying something meaningful. A fantastic start to a series that only gets better.\n\nFor those familiar with the TV Series I'll add that as usual the book is way better. The books dive so much deeper into the character's internal motivations and conflicts. The TV Series seems to have hope, though and I think Skarsgård gives Murderbot the right voice, the show just needs a little better writing and longer story arcs.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-23", "text": "lyny\n253 reviews\n1 follower\nFollow\nNovember 6, 2025\nWell written AI influenced sci fi. (My score reflects that I am not a great fan of sci fi, but it has won many awards when originally published in 2017, and I can see why - it is an enjoyable set up and set of characters, and with a relatively simple plot).\n\nThe story is told by the Murderbot, who is a constructed AI robot with some organic (human-style) bits and is owned by a company that leases it out to provide security for companies (in this case exploring new planets for valuable minerals). The bot gets direct downloads of various kinds, and is equipped with weapons. Murderbots are much harder to kill than humans (for one thing they are encased in armour), and most parts of them can be replaced by the company – or if things go wrong they can be scrapped. This Murderbot is uncomfortable about interaction with humans, but is skilled at interpreting their emotions and actions. It prefers to have time in a separate part of the space unit, and when in human company to keep its face shield opaque (though the head part is installed to not frighten them being a ‘standard, generic human’ head p15). However it has a form of intelligence that has allowed it to subvert some of the things built into the AI by the company. In particular it has dismantled the governor unit that allows it to be directly controlled by the company, but also has done that in a way where their own systems will not pick it up. So in that sense it has agency – freedom to act by its own control. It also seems to experience interests and boredom, and specializes in downloading entertainment soapie type programs and spending a lot of time watching them, and on the other hand, ignoring downloads and security updates and only taking up what it sees as relevant.\n\nMany reviewers have commented positively on the engaging character and voice of this Murderbot – it doesn’t have a sex, but I can imagine it being played by a lugubrious older British actor.\n\nThe set up emphasizes a number of things about the context – in particular the ongoing profit motive driving things, and the way in which the company does things in the cheapest way that seems viable, so things can go wrong because of the ‘crap’ materials. It also sets out three categories of beings in a class type of hierarchy: humans, cyber enhanced humans, and murderbots. It is common for the murderbots to be seen and treated as robots, but in this story the team, especially the leader Mensah, begin to see the bot as having an identity, and caring for it. Similarly, the bot begins to act to save and ‘care for’ the humans, beyond what has been apparently built in.\n\nThe central plot is about some of the info systems and energy beginning to not be available, and the bot and crew suspecting the crew of the unit they were about to hook up with and reload from has been attacked and killed. They do find most of the crew dead, with some robots having apparently gone rogue (actually reprogrammed by some others I think), and Murderbot and the human crew perform various actions to save each other at different points. As a result when they get back to the company control, Mensah arranges to permanently buy the Murderbot so they can ‘adopt it’. In this context this is seen somewhat like buying and liberating a slave. But Murderbot doesn’t want to exchange one type of surveillance and control for another (albeit one partly based on empathy and care) and the story finishes with it managing to disable ways it can be traced and hitch-hiking a ride somewhere else where no-one knows of its existence.\n\n2025\nLike\nComment"}

I know that this is a first book and the later books will probably explore more of Murderbot as a character and their backstory but I wish that the first book had a little bit more of that instead of the murder mystery. The plot of the book felt a little boring to me to be honest, I enjoy reading in Murderbot's perspective but the situation was kind of generic for me. I'm hoping the next books have something more exciting or new to live up to the hype.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

J’ai aimé le personnage de l’Assasynth, qui est attachant. Cependant, le format court ne permet pas de développer des personnages étoffés et une intrigue complexe. J’ai toutefois aimé les réflexions de l’autrice autour de la conscience et du libre arbitre des synthétiques.

I think it's safe to say it was really good, and I'll be getting the rest of the series.\n\nI like the murderbot character. I think the author did a great job writing its thoughts and feelings in a way that's not quite human, not entirely machine, and not \"part human, part machine\" either, but a homogeneous blend of both.\n\nI also liked some of the human characters that murderbot was protecting, so I hope to see them again in the other books. Only a few of the humans got enough screen time for the reader to get to know them a little, but those few were interesting enough that I'd like to get to know them better.\n\nAnd we learned just enough about the setting to feel like it's a fully formed universe, but it's mostly in the background so it didn't distract from the story. I'm looking forward to learning more about this universe and the societies that inhabit it. There are many interesting things here, and murderbot provides a unique perspective for us to see it all.\nsci-fi-and-steampunk\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

I feel this is a better sci fi book than it is an ace book. Although the main character struggles with being incorrectly perceived as a sex bot, it ultimately is in a fundamentally different category of nonsexual beings, which I would say is pretty dissimilar from asexual humans who share the same physical form as allosexual humans.\n\nThe story was interesting and made good use of the novella form. There was a clear plotline and the characters were developed well.

I started reading this at the recommendation of my daughter who knows I like a good science fiction story. This is so far, a really good series. I like that this book was relatively short which I really liked. However having said that, this book is well written and as such, the author packs a lot of information and story into this first book. I was surprised there was so little back story on the team of scientists yet I had to remind myself that the story is being told from the perspective of the main character, the murder bot. The story does conclude at the the end of the book yet leaves just enough cliff hanger to inspire you to keep reading onto the next book. After reading Stephen King for so long, this was a refreshing book. She didn't feel the need to bog the story down with unnecessary details and kept the story moving forward at all times. I am looking forward to continue reading the next book as this will be an easy totally enjoyable read. I would recommend this book and series to anyone who likes science fiction pertaining to the future. This story does not take place on Earth or even this galaxy which makes it easy to just get into the book. I'm currently reading the second book of the series, Artificial Condition. These books are all fairly short so finishing a book is not a long daunting task to get to the end yet each book is full of actual story.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-11-06", "text": "Stephen\n1,941 reviews\n139 followers\nFollow\nNovember 6, 2025\nAll Systems Red is a fun action-mystery thriller in a SF context. Our narrator, as the series title “Murderbot Diaries” might suggest, is not quite human. Murderbot is instead a robotic-organic construct that prefers humans see it, or him, as a robot: that way he’s left alone to watch recorded TV dramas in his head when not monitoring feeds and shooting bogies as need shooting. Unlike most constructs, though, Murderbot is rogue: at some point he hacked his “governor module”, the bit that forces him to respond to orders, and has been keeping this secret to avoid being disassembled for parts, or worse – “fixed”. Murderbot as he styles himself, is a security unit: his whole function is to crush, kill, and demolish. We find out through the text that Murderbot hacked himself not to give him leeway to get rowdy, but because sometimes conflicting orders diminished his ability to function. Although I enjoyed the story, Murderbot didn’t seem like an ‘other’ – unlike Shelli or Seven of Nine, whose cognition and verbal expression hint at their being different, and to a lesser degree R. Daneel Olivaw. (I say lesser because Olivaw was literally trying to pass as human for most of his lifespan and did fairly well at it.) I could see continuing in this series, as it made for fun reading.\nscience-fiction\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Even from one of the very first lines of the book, Murderbot says something like \"I did not care because I was not programmed to care about that.\" And that's such a brilliant and deliberate choice of words. It didn't say \"I was not programmed to be responsible for that\" or \"I was not programmed to be invested in that\" or anything of the like. It said \"I was not programmed to care.\" And that in and of itself just makes you think so much about the nature of sentience. \"Caring\" is something innate, and internal. Caring implies a personal attachment to something. And whether Murderbot was programmed to do so or not, saying that means that is does have the capacity to care, one way or another.\n2025\n \n2025-pick-your-poison\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

Гадаєте він стане смертоносним вбивцею, що помішаний на знищенні людей?\n\nА дзуськи! Він перетвориться на тривожного та апатичного мілленіала, якому ніяково від зорового контакту з людьми.\n\n“Щоденник вбивцебота” - це проста оповідь із ненав’язливим сюжетом, що подекуди приправлений іронією та поверхневими філософськими роздумами про соціальну взаємодію.\n\nМаємо напіворганічного, напівмеханічного андроїда наділеного самосвідомістю. Він супроводжує групу науковців на відаленній планеті, де має дбає про їхню безпеку.\n\nНаш вартмех, таємно від людей, хакнув свій модуль контролю, тож тепер самостійно може вирішувати виконувати отримані від людей накази чи ні.\n\nЩоб не бути викритим він створює видимість роботи. Робить все, щоб його зайвий раз не діставали, а у вільний час залипає у потоках музики та багатосерійних мелодрам.\n\nЦе не перша його взаємодія із людьми, але на відміну від попередніх разів, ця група науковців йому дійсно подобається. Як то кажуть - він потрапив у здоровий і нетоксичний колектив (от везучий гівнюк). У нього виникає щось типу прив’язаності та симпатії, і коли його підопічним загрожує небезпека, робить все, аби їх врятувати.\n\nІсторія вбивцебота простакувата і поверхнева, але дуже влучно передає відчуття розгубленості та інтровертності.\n\nНаприклад ось ця фраза андроїда: “постійне носіння броні позбавляє зайвої взаємодії”. Звичайно вона вжита буквально, бо він дійсно носить механічну броню, але в контексті історії персонаж використовує її не тільки як фізичний, але й ментальний щит.\n\nЗагалом мені подобається, що наш андроїд не суперінтелект із зловісним планом і жагою до вбивств. Це і не людина і не машина. Йому потрібно розібратися у собі, віднайти свою ідентичність, налагодити діалог із самим собою. Кожна його взаємодія із соціумом - це виклик, збентеження, фактично “ламання” себе, проте він вчиться якось із цим справлятися.\n\nКнига невелика, підходить для відпочинкового читання. Але тут є й над чим задуматися.\n\nLike\nComment"}

It reads more like a long short story than a novel, but that worked as an entry point into the world. Murderbot's dry humor landed well, and the story stayed tight and compact throughout.\nI can see why this gets so much love, though I went in expecting maybe a bit more given the enthusiasm around it. But it's also clearly just the beginning - more of a promising setup than a complete statement.

What the scientists don't know (yet), is that Murderbot had hacked its own system and is currently operating as a free agent while continuing with doing its job and saving its human companions (while binge watching its favorite shows, because what else is it supposed to do with its free time?)\n\nMurderbot is great at its job, but doesn't know how to interact with humans (nor does it enjoy it). It's social awkwardness is relatable (I too, prefer humans from TV shows than those from real life) which makes it a very likeable character.\n\nThis is a really fun novella and entertaining audiobook to listen to.

He doesn't have any goals or motivation, either, and basically just hangs around babysitting some humans until the novella decides it's time to be over. I don't see any reason to read more of this. It seems like it'll be an episodic series, but the one episode I've read thus far was really boring.\n\nFor something that was hyped to comedic levels, this is disappointing. This boring novella won the Hugo and the Nebula, but I guess that just goes to show how worthless those awards are nowadays.

The found family is going to be great the major problem is that it’s just too short. It’s not long enough to get a good depth to the character and form a bond with them that makes me want to continue the series.\n\nUpdate after reading the second. The second book adds so much more depth to the character through exploring his back story of why he’s gone rogue. While still too short in my opinion for how great it was as it’s a second book it felt like a more substantial story you could be immersed in. Will definitely continue the series.\nLike\nComment"}

Outside of Murderbot being a diva, I liked how they, rather than being envious of humans, they feel a mix of discomfort and annoyance towards them. They’re very uncomfortable with their personhood, which is an interesting take on the sentience trope.\nLike\nComment"}

It is a low SCI-FI thriller/mystery packed with Humour, Action and a bit of self discovery.\n\n\n“It’s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.” He shook his head, dismissing it. “It’s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can’t be watching it, not in that volume; we’d notice.”\nI snorted. He underestimated me.\n\n\nIt is no wonder that the book got made into a tv-series, because it was made for exactly this. It is short (144 pages) and it reads exactly like an episode from a multipart drama series. A single mystery per book in the series.\n\nProse is simple, and as much I hate to say it, you can read it with your brain on a vacation (Does not mean that it is bad, just that it is relatively simple read)\n\nGood world building (from what you can accomplish in 140 pages) and characters.

But I wasn't.\n\nThis is a really good book and looks to start an excellent series. It is more a novella in length and content, but serves as an introduction to Murderbot and shows the sorts of interactions and intentions that will inform the character in later books. I enjoyed the read quite a bit.\n\nThe pacing was good, but not great; some areas dragged a bit but not because the reader needed a break or that a slower pace added to the plot. The character is meant to be ambiguous (I hope) and that came through quite well. The supporting characters were fleshed out well enough, as to be expected in a novella (not enough pages to get more depth). The setting was simple and the plot moved along a pretty obvious path.\nowned\n16 likes\nLike\nComment"}

It's packed with subtle witty remarks that kept me entertained throughout. What caught me off guard was how eerily relatable Murderbot is. A bot with an addiction to entertainment and crippling social anxiety, that sounds like someone I know very well (yes, it's me). There's something both hilarious and oddly touching about seeing your own tendencies reflected in a security robot.\n\nI don't have much else to say except this: just read it. You'll find it really engaging even if, like me, you're not normally a sci-fi fan. The ending leaves so many exciting possibilities for future books in the series and I definitely want to continue following Murderbot's journey.\n\nAlso, I'm genuinely excited to watch the TV adaptation that came out recently!!\n────── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ──────\n\nQuotes worth mentioning:\n“𝐼 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑎 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑢𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑟 𝑎𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐼 ℎ𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑑 𝑚𝑦 𝑔𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑟 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒, 𝑏𝑢𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝐼 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝐼 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑠 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑠.\"\n\n“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑚𝑎𝑦 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝐼 𝑑𝑜 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑒, 𝐼’𝑚 𝑎 𝑝𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑡.”\n\n⋆༺𓆩🗡𓆪༻⋆\nHappy Reading!

The world setting is interesting, with some dark elements that were not expanded further.\n\nMy biggest reason why I rate it as a 3/5 but not higher is that I don’t like the murderbot character as the main character too much. It is because there are practically very few motivations for its actions. It is a relatable character, and I like that about it. But it doesn’t have much skin (skin suit?) in the game, and it makes it quite difficult for me to root for it. It did not grow in its own character and what it wants, which makes the read feel a lot more like a ride with the group rather than witnessing them experience a life-or-death situation. I like that it is making small decisions like taking the helmet off as it starts to warm up to the group. It fits the role of a spiritual animal for the ride, but I want someone with a slightly stronger motive to keep the pace of the story rather than the EvilSurvey pushing the pace.\nLike\nComment"}

Picked this book that has been siting in my tbr, for quite sometime now, and im glad I did.\n\nLoved how we were just tossed onto some remote, random planet following a robot and its crew, with no explanation needed. It was action from the first page. The author believed in the reader's ability to figure out the story as we went along.\n\nWhat kept me reading the book, was how much I loved the crew. Quite frankly, I was more interested in the characters and their interactions, then the plot, lol. Might read the sequel\nLike\nComment"}

The characterizations were on-point, the way the world was described, both physically and emotionally felt right for the POV, and the stakes/problem were interesting enough to keep the story moving. I liked the ending too, it was satisfying, but opens the story up to continuation. It is not a happily ever after neat and tidy ending, but it fits with the character and style of the story.\n\nIt is a quick read, but since there are a lot of them I look forward to spending more time with the murderbot to see where it ends up, and to learn more about the world it is in.\n\n\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

The reader is given insight to the inner thoughts and impulses of our robotic main character which adds comedy, or dark humor at least! It becomes almost a coming of age book as the robot (reprogrammed from earlier deployments) experiences the worlds he (it) is tasked to. Interestingly we find even robots are prejudiced, though their biase is towards other robots or programs and the tasks these other systems are burdened with. I enjoyed this as an audiobook and note that not all good books work well as audiobooks but this one does!! It’s a quick read and interesting through and through!\nLike\nComment"}

It also watches a LOT of bad TV shows. We meet Murderbot working for Dr Mensah's team on a planet which is being identified for use as a resource mine, and then things go wrong for a secondary team on the same planet.\n\nMurderbot is so sarcastic and apathetic, it really couldn't care less about most things and I think that's why I fogged up a bit when I saw it talking about Dr Mensah's team as \"my humans\". While it doesn't really care about its job as long as it gets downtime to watch shows, and it kind of skips a lot of the boring paperwork tasks it should be completing, Murderbot does come to care about its charges and their wellbeing. I loved this little robot, for me there wasn't enough story here, I wanted more but I suspect that this was a handshake at the beginning of the whole thing, it was a gentle introduction and I will be reading on to find out what is next in store for the cynical, pessimistic, funny Murderbot.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "Performance reliability at 100% and increasing\n\nOMG, I'm in love with Murderbot. I'm kidding, I'm kidding…or am I?\n\nYes, I will talk about Murderbot as he/him. To me, Murderbot is a He. Now, with this obvious infuriating and offending personal preference out of some people’s way, let’s dive in. SPOILERS ahead.\n\nBelieve me when I tell you that you’ll find it simply impossible not to love this self-aware SecUnit that hacked into his own governor module and is anxious around humans and doesn't like showing his face.\n\nHow can you not like the funny, sarcastic bot thinking he's a complete failure at his murdering job and would rather watch tv shows?\n\nMurderbot might feel like an unreliable narrator because it’s very obvious he’s struggling with his identity and feelings and confusion about what it means to be alive and free, but his tone is absolutely a blast. He’s sarcastic, awkward, anxious, uncomfortable around humans, he hates them but also cares for them, he doesn’t like showing his face, but also does it when requested by a certain someone, even though he was not forced to do it (he was a Free Agent, no longer a slave of his programming).\n\n\nBut she had barely looked at me and I had barely looked at her because again, murderbot + actual human = awkwardness.\n\n\n\nI put the pilot’s console on standby, and looked at Mensah. She pressed her lips together, like she wanted to say something and was repressing the urge. Then she nodded firmly and said, “Good luck.”\n\nI felt like I should say something to her, and didn’t know what, and just stared at her awkwardly for a few seconds. Then I sealed up my helmet and got out of the hopper as fast as I could.\n\n\n\nMensah sent me a private message through the feed: I hope you’re all right.\n\nBecause you need me. I don’t know where that came from. Alright, it came from me, but she was my client, I was a SecUnit. There was no emotional contract between us. There was no rational reason for me to sound like a whiny human baby.\n\n\nThis shows perfectly how confused he was by his own thoughts and desires, his feelings often betraying an underlying need for connection even when he claims he despises it, even when he doesn’t know how to feel about his own thoughts.\n\nI mean, how adorable is that? No? Too emotional and lovey-dovey? How about this?\n\n\n\"So you don’t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.”\n\n“Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.\n\n\n\n“There’s another question I’d like the answer to.”\nGurathin looked at me expectantly. She isn’t talking about me, idiot.\n\n\n\nGurathin hesitated. “It’s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.”[…] “It’s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can’t be watching it, not in that volume; we’d notice.”\n\nI snorted. He underestimated me.\n\nRatthi said, “The one where the colony’s solicitor killed the terraforming supervisor who was the secondary donor for her implanted baby?”\n\nAgain, I couldn’t help it. I said, “She didn’t kill him, that’s a fucking lie.”\n\nRatthi turned to Mensah. “It’s watching it.”\n\n\n\n“It calls itself ‘Murderbot’ , Gurathin said.\nFrom their expressions I knew everything I felt was showing on my face, and I hate that. I grated out, “That was private.”\n\n\n\nWhat I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.\n\n\n\n“You don’t need to look at me. I’m not a sexbot.”\n\n\nThis is the other side of him, the part that makes us laugh. But even in this sort of aggression and displeasure of interacting with humans, it’s so obvious that he does this because some other part of him is fighting back. It’s a paradox within him that he struggles with to reconcile. So to Murderbot the human interactions felt like he was seen as a thing to be used for their own gratification. He lives in a world where constructs like him, half robot half human parts, are treated and used as slaves. They were lucky if they were bought by a decent human being to free their contract.

I'm kidding, I'm kidding…or am I?\n\nYes, I will talk about Murderbot as he/him. To me, Murderbot is a He. Now, with this obvious infuriating and offending personal preference out of some people’s way, let’s dive in. SPOILERS ahead.\n\nBelieve me when I tell you that you’ll find it simply impossible not to love this self-aware SecUnit that hacked into his own governor module and is anxious around humans and doesn't like showing his face.\n\nHow can you not like the funny, sarcastic bot thinking he's a complete failure at his murdering job and would rather watch tv shows?\n\nMurderbot might feel like an unreliable narrator because it’s very obvious he’s struggling with his identity and feelings and confusion about what it means to be alive and free, but his tone is absolutely a blast. He’s sarcastic, awkward, anxious, uncomfortable around humans, he hates them but also cares for them, he doesn’t like showing his face, but also does it when requested by a certain someone, even though he was not forced to do it (he was a Free Agent, no longer a slave of his programming).\n\n\nBut she had barely looked at me and I had barely looked at her because again, murderbot + actual human = awkwardness.\n\n\n\nI put the pilot’s console on standby, and looked at Mensah. She pressed her lips together, like she wanted to say something and was repressing the urge. Then she nodded firmly and said, “Good luck.”\n\nI felt like I should say something to her, and didn’t know what, and just stared at her awkwardly for a few seconds. Then I sealed up my helmet and got out of the hopper as fast as I could.\n\n\n\nMensah sent me a private message through the feed: I hope you’re all right.\n\nBecause you need me. I don’t know where that came from. Alright, it came from me, but she was my client, I was a SecUnit. There was no emotional contract between us. There was no rational reason for me to sound like a whiny human baby.\n\n\nThis shows perfectly how confused he was by his own thoughts and desires, his feelings often betraying an underlying need for connection even when he claims he despises it, even when he doesn’t know how to feel about his own thoughts.\n\nI mean, how adorable is that? No? Too emotional and lovey-dovey? How about this?\n\n\n\"So you don’t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.”\n\n“Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.\n\n\n\n“There’s another question I’d like the answer to.”\nGurathin looked at me expectantly. She isn’t talking about me, idiot.\n\n\n\nGurathin hesitated. “It’s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.”[…] “It’s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can’t be watching it, not in that volume; we’d notice.”\n\nI snorted. He underestimated me.\n\nRatthi said, “The one where the colony’s solicitor killed the terraforming supervisor who was the secondary donor for her implanted baby?”\n\nAgain, I couldn’t help it. I said, “She didn’t kill him, that’s a fucking lie.”\n\nRatthi turned to Mensah. “It’s watching it.”\n\n\n\n“It calls itself ‘Murderbot’ , Gurathin said.\nFrom their expressions I knew everything I felt was showing on my face, and I hate that. I grated out, “That was private.”\n\n\n\nWhat I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.\n\n\n\n“You don’t need to look at me. I’m not a sexbot.”\n\n\nThis is the other side of him, the part that makes us laugh. But even in this sort of aggression and displeasure of interacting with humans, it’s so obvious that he does this because some other part of him is fighting back. It’s a paradox within him that he struggles with to reconcile. So to Murderbot the human interactions felt like he was seen as a thing to be used for their own gratification. He lives in a world where constructs like him, half robot half human parts, are treated and used as slaves. They were lucky if they were bought by a decent human being to free their contract. As he states, most of those bots fall in love with their guardians, albeit in secret.\n\nWhen DeltFall, a sister habitat on the other side of the planet Murderbot is currently operating on with his crew, is going silent, they set on a mission to find out what's going on with that base.\n\nUpon entering the base, he finds out the humans were indeed dead and the SecUnits in there went rogue.

Trained to kill but hates its job. Would rather watch shows but ends up reluctantly, snarkily saving humans when they get themselves in trouble. A fun listen with lots of one-liners and great moments. The sci-fi world we're in (with space stations, ships, bots, and interplanetary corporate corruption) as well as the neural networks (and 'feeds') everyone uses to communicate were cleverly integrated into the story in a way that makes sense without info dumping.\n\nMurderbot is technically genderless (has no genitals nor thinks of itself as one or the other) but if you listen to the audio or watch the show, you'll probably picture it as male. Either way, Murderbot is super relatable, hilarious, and, surprise, goes through character development!\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n(And props to the TV series for creating scenes from \"Sanctuary Moon\", Murderbot's favorite show.)\nLike\nComment"}

Ms. Wells has hit gold as the 'Murderbot Diaries' (five so far?) which has been adapted into a very funny Apple + series. The books are a little more technical but it is clear that the shy 'construct'*, Murderbot, a blend of organic material and machine, was born in her writing. The TV show is very well cast with Alex Skaragard killing it as Murderbot.\nIn the book and the show, Murderbot, the 'construct', is employed as a Sec Unit (security unit) to guarantee the safety of a team of explorers looking for value in an unexplored planet. Throughout Ms. Wells harpoons modern everything- corporate structure, mass media, capitalism, romance; her broad brush reminded me of Doug Adams and the Hitchhiker books.\nLight, fun, short. Looking forward to book 2.\n\n*I imagine the term cyborg is not used in order to shed all pre-conceived notions and the history of famous cyborgs (Terminator etc.)\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

He's just not all that particularly interested in doing a thorough job of it - not since he managed to free himself from the programming that could control him.

Murderbot is a lovely blend of cranky old man, a moody teenager and a soap opera obsessed introverted uncle.

The series was only a 3 Star affair, but the humor was stronger on film. The only good thing in this was the robot's irony an casual contempt for the humans it was watching over. Murderbot's snide comments didn't really resonate on the page as they did on the screen. The book is mercifully short as the story isn't much to consider.\nscience-fiction\n \nthriller\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

I really enjoyed this novella. The main character is a SecUnit, a Murderbot, part human part robot who has been rented from the Company for exploration on another planet. I am certainly over-simplifying this and probably not even all that accurately. In any event, this Murderbot has more human qualities than it should and connects with the humans for whom he is working. His human group comes under attack and he must help and defend them. Great story. On to the next one!\nLike\nComment"}

The prose was easy to digest, humorous at times, and I really liked the occasional fourth wall break.\n\nThat said the writing does leave a lot to be desired for description. You’re told what things are and who people are but not what they look like. Also none of the human characters feel unique from one another. I think this is the major flaw of the story. The PreservationAux surbey team should have been smaller so we could get some better characterization.\n\nOverall an enjoyable read and I actually like the shorter length. Also, love the poly rep, wasn’t expecting that even if it was just a couple off-hand comments.\n\nAnyways, I’ll definitely be continuing in the series to see where SecUnit ends up.\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot (yes, that’s his name) is hilariously awkward, loathes interacting with humans, and would much rather watch tv shows all day. Relatable. Watching him try to navigate his emotions towards the humans is quite cute. It’s like he truly wants to protect them but just can’t understand why.\n\nThe writing is simplistic but does a good job capturing the no-frills, deadpan voice of a robot with a little attitude. Very little is explained about the world, but I imagine that is intentional because why would a robot give a shit about anything other than his objective (and his tv shows). Lots of funny quips.

There’s page turning action sequences and Wells is adept at exploring Murderbot’s consciousness while keeping the reader interested.\n\nThe story is enabled by the presence of vast leaps in technology that apparently don’t include rudimentary security automation, but it’s a hallmark of the genre. I was inclined to be troubled by it but have to admit that I’m not aware of much (if any) good sci-fi stories that don’t downplay the conflict between automation and autonomy.\nLike\nComment"}

It's a nice, quick read, with its own voice and an interesting and kinda funny premise, but I couldn't help but feel like there could be done much more with it. Apart from the so called Murderbot, I can't say I remember any of the other characters. And the action, I found it kinda repetitve, blasters going off and murderbots blowing up. Now for the story, it is quick action-y mission of our robotic 'hero' with its ups and downs, that is servicable, even though the final segment is kind of underwhelming and abrupt.\n\nAnd not to be a negative Nancy, let's talk about the good stuff. The Murderbot. I really like this character and want to see more of him (of it?). He (it?) is the only reason I want to and will read the next books, that's how much of a pull he has. The ending promises great things with this character and I will oblige.\nAnother good thing is the prose. It is exactly what a sci-fi book needs. Not too difficult scientific mumbo-jumbo that'll get you lost, but the more-is-less approach that doesn't exclude any reader.\n\nSo, yeah, it's a recommend for sci-fi fans and maybe non-sci-fi fans, being this short and not time consuming.\n\n\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

My favorite aspect of this series is that Murderbot echoes what a lot of us think on a daily basis. I am not comfortable around these people, this job is stupid, I would rather be in my room watching my favorite TV shows. As much as I enjoy Murderbot the character, I was less enthused about Murderbot the story. This feels extremely episodic, which makes sense, since I believe it is a television show now. The story was largely a generic science fiction affair, over right when it felt like it might tread new territory. Bonus recommendation, if you like Murderbot and play video games, try Citizen Sleeper. Similar themes, though Citizen Sleeper did not have the same sort of levity Murderbot often had.\nsci-fi\nLike\nComment"}

I've been so deep in the Asimov sauce that I lowkey forgot how good it can feel to read a text that has basic respect for women and gives proper accolades to smart female scientist characters. To all my autistic friends that told me to read this series because Murderbot is painfully relatable, congrats on being 100% right. The running bit about whether or not his face shows through the armor is handled really well, I know it represents/means a lot but as a neurodivergent person myself it was really recognizable as masking behaviour. This book is a self-contained, well-paced story that gives details where necessary but keeps things generic where not to avoid the technobabble exposition that weighs down a lot of sci-fi. I found all the characters immediately compelling and sympathetic. The story is nothing \"new\" or revelatory, but it was smartly told with no painful plot-holes or stupid decisions made by the main cast just for plot purposes. Wells' prose is functional without being beautiful, which is where this book missed the 5 stars for me, but I don't really care. I look forward to the rest of the series!\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The plot and writing were also quite enjoyable, with a great deal of witty humour and interesting tidbits of worldbuilding even in the short span of time.

{"username": "", "date": "I returned to this book after reading the start of it almost 6 years ago in high school, and it was both very fun and very intriguing to see how much I knew about the book and how little I actually remembered. Before I was convinced that Murderbot was a full and true robot but in reality they’re more of a cyborg. Still, the fascination I had with Murderbot’s synthetic parts persisted, and I loved seeing how their internal systems operated much like a machine but their humanity shone through with achingly dry humor and sarcasm. I grew to love Murderbot’s human crew and Mensah’s compassion. Seeing Murderbot display obvious signs of personhood in spite of their belief in being expendable and unfeeling was endearing and fascinating. I also love the correlations between Murderbot and neurodivergence that became more apparent as Murderbot is revealed to their crew and is forced to interract with them. Murderbot's struggles with eye contact, controlling emotions, and quick exposure to socialization with humans struck me as very reminiscent of the learnings of a neurospicy person navigating a neurotypical world, with them sometimes unfortunately having to mask their true selves to get by. I can see how connecting Murderbot to an example of neurodivergence kind of plays into the “unfeeling robot” stereotypes that come with it; however, I think these connections to neurodivergence only serve to highlight Murderbot’s humanity and empathy, and not reduce them to the assumptions that Murderbot is already forced to endure as a SecUnit.

{"username": "", "date": "2025-09-29", "text": "t’Jacques Guillot\n15 reviews\nFollow\nSeptember 29, 2025\nThis was a fine book. It was enjoyable in the moment of reading, but it also felt like it wouldn’t leave much of an impression on me.\n\nThe book starts in media res of an action scene, and the author efficiently illustrates the world-building simply by letting the story play out. By the end of the first chapter you get a fun action scene and a foundational understanding of this sci-fi world and how secunits work, as well as some questions about world building that are soon answered in later chapters. The author shows instead of telling.\n\nI also noticed that chapter endings made me want to start the next chapter immediately. The pacing was good.\n\nHowever, I am not a fan of the quirky awkwardness of the narrator. I’m also irritated by robots always being autistic-coded in sci-fi. It makes sense in the world why the secunit wouldn’t get along with humans. But I bet there are more fictional autistic robots than there are fictional autistic humans. It’s a sensible metaphor, but it is so played out.\n\nThere was a handful of horrible cliches in the writing, like in the line, “but my speed was off the charts.” I think the fact that these few instances distracted me from the rest of the quote-good writing says more about me than the author. But still that line made me want to return the book early.\n\nThe issue of personhood and autonomy felt underdeveloped until the very end. And the ending surprised me in a good way. I’ll admit it made me want to read a sequel.\n\nOverall, this book didn’t really challenge me. It didn’t challenge my idea of what it means to be a person. It didn’t challenge my ideas of what are ethical practices for pioneering, settling, resource extraction. It was an entertaining novella, but I won’t be thinking about it nearly as long as I think about books that I love, and even books that I hate!\n\nFor its brevity and the quality of writing, this book is worth a read.\nLike\nComment"}

I listened to both the regular audiobook but also the dramatized version. Fair warning, if you try to read along with the dramatized version, it’s a cool listen but they skip a lot of content, which is why I switched to the regular audiobook to follow along better.\n\nI know this book is the first in the series, so I’m sure it gets better, but I did struggle a little to really feel engaged with the book, despite how short it is. To keep you engaged, there were some witty monologue and comments from our antisocial murderbot, as well as some action scenes sprinkled in.\n\nI’d like to continue with the series and eventually watch the tv series to compare.\nLike\nComment"}

It was kind of tragic for that, becasue it never really considered itself equal to the humans, keeping them at arms length away, shutting itself off from possible connections.\n\nAnd as someone who also feels alienated from the rest of humanity, it’s so encouraging to think about how much love can exist in places you can’t notice it.\n\nI’m going to need to read this again to absorb the details, I flew through it because it was such a thriller.\n\nThis really made me feel something.

They are kept in line by a governor module inside their chest that will punish them if they step out of line. However, through an unusual set of circumstances, our hero of this story found a way to disable his governor module and \"go rogue\". Only in this universe, rogue sec units are generally berserk killing machines that need to be put down yesterday. Our hero maintains his cool and composure, and is trying to get through life, figure out his purpose and what he \"is\", his general existential existence, how he just wants to watch his soap operas, and not have anything to do with humans when he can help it, all while protecting clients who had hired him as their security droid. Given that this particular set of clients actually treat him as a being and not a tool, he comes to reluctantly appreciate their good will (though he would never really admit this), and...well, let's just say he goes above and beyond, though in his view that's standard ops of a 'murderbot' protecting clients.\n\nI did this as an audiobook instead of reading it directly.

While I found \"All Systems Red\" easy to read and fast-paced (it is a novella after all), I am a bit mystified about the hype. It might be because this story isn't trying too hard - it neither exploits the funny situations that being almost a human (but not quite) in a world of humans would cause nor is it a deep exploration about what makes us human. Both of those are hard to get right and often end up feeling cringe or causing eye-rolling. The result was a bit bland though. I'm not sure I'll remember this a few years down the line.\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

The idea was so painful that I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.”\n\nAll Systems Red introduces us to a SecUnit who calls itself Murderbot. After a tragic incident with a former group of humans, Murderbot is assigned to protect a new set of clients—but not before secretly hacking its own governor module. What follows is a mix of planetary hostiles, a neighboring team of scientists going mysteriously offline, and a SecUnit who would much rather be binge-watching reality TV than doing its job.\n\nThis was such a quick and fun read. Murderbot is surprisingly relatable—shy, awkward, and more invested in catching up on shows than saving the day. Watching it slowly shift from apathy to questioning what it means to care was both fascinating and endearing. I also appreciated the small glimpses into its tragic past, which left me eager to learn more in the rest of the series.\n\nRecommended if you enjoy science fiction, reluctant and sarcastic protagonists, and fast-paced books that can be devoured in one sitting.\nread-2025\nLike\nComment"}

I actually felt a little sad for him, which I wasn’t expecting, and now I can’t wait to follow more of his adventures. One of my favorite touches was his obsession with Sanctuary Moon, cause I mean, the idea of a soap opera that dramatic and over the top had me grinning every time it came up.\nLike\nComment"}

However, while the first point is fairly well developed, the whole soap opera thing barely matters and struck me as an interesting idea but poorly executed.\n\nIn short: it’s a short book, but it felt long — and I don’t think I’ll be moving on to the next one.\n2 likes\nLike\nComment"}

There's something inherently absurd and funny in the basic premise, but reading it never really made me crack a proper smile or chuckle. I’ll give Wells credit, the tone and voice is consistent and intentional here (and the audiobook narrator really helps), but I can’t help thinking this is a book written in the style of a Tumblr post - all the ‘kindas’ ‘stuff’ ‘things’ and ‘whatevers’ - and that’s just not really my cup of tea. It also reminds me of LeGuin's essay 'From Elfland to Poughkeepsie' where she cleverly introduces a Fantasy excerpt, but changes a few words and it becomes devoid of any of the trappings of genre fiction. You can't do that with the properly Fantastic dialogue like you see in Dunsany or Eddison she says. This feels a bit like the Poughkeepsie equivalent of Science Fiction, and I don't really need any more blandly replaceable internet lingo in my life.\n\nI also struggle a lot with short stories and novellas, so the length here didn't help. Despite the page count, it doesn't really start in media res at all, but takes about half the length before the proper conflict starts. After the halfway point, things pick up a bit. I might keep going just to see how Wells handles a more traditional novel-length story. Nothing super \"wrong\" here, it just didn't grip or impress me as much as I wanted based on reputation alone.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-09-18", "text": "Wise_owl\n310 reviews\n11 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 18, 2025\nShort, Sweet and satisfies. This book was the equivalent to a truly satisfying street-side meal. Pick your choice; Sausage on a Bun, Ramen, Taco's, Fried Meat Skewers, Shwarma.... it wasn't a sit down meal, but damn if it didn't do exactly what I wanted it to and do it so well I put the second book on order the moment I was done.\n\nMurderbot, the first person narrator of this work, is a SecUnit; a sort of robot/bioroid/cyborg thing. An artificial entity with both mechano-electrical and biological parts. We are informed that these things exist throughout the galaxy, and SecUnits are obviously created for... well Security. It has blasters housed in it's arms; it wears armour, it's trained to fight and protect it's charges.\n\nThis SecUnit Thoguh, has overridden it's own Governor Module, the component that forces it to obey humans and not hurt them. What initially seems a bit ominous, in it's name, may serve on some level as a bit of irony. I mean, why put deadly weapons into a thing unless it's going to kill people doing it's function.\n\nRegardless Murderbot is hiding, not wanting to kill all of humanity(as it says, that is a stupidly human thing to think of doing), but rather just wanting to do as little work as possible and watch soap opera's(which is also a stupid human thing to be doing, but who am I to judge).\n\nSo it is places with a group of kind of hippy-scientists doing a survey on a planet; they are not from the 'corporate zone' which appears to be the central polity in this universe, but from something called the Preserver Alliance outside of it. This causes some consternation as they have weird idea's, like taht the Sec Unit might be a person and should be talked to like one, that interfere with the aforementioned being not noticed and watching entertainment programming.\n\nOf course, things go belly up and... well just read the book, it was great and it's a short read at something like 150 pages. Honestly it made me think maybe more books should be that sort of length, and you're talking to some-one whose core bread and butter for decades has been 'Series that takes me a decade to finish'.\n\nComedic, Good Sci-Fi, and Good Character study, just go out and read it.\nLike\nComment"}

Con esto no quiero decir que la saga de Matabot sea tonta, ya que su crítica a la humanidad está muy bien dirigida, pero el caso es que si analizamos el género y contemplamos los estantes de las librerías, parece que solo hay espacio para las obras que ambicionan crear universos complejos (y que luego rara vez lo consiguen).\n\nMe gustaría encontrar a más autores que no se lo tengan tan creído y que expongan situaciones simples, misiones rutinarias con algún giro inesperado y con personajes creíbles como se hace aquí. Realmente no hace falta nada más. El tema de la inteligencia artificial está ya en todos lados, especialmente desde el alarmismo, así que agradezco propuestas como esta, más ligeras y gratificantes.\n\nENGLISH\nI think we're getting used to the idea that science fiction has to be epic, depressing, or intelligent. What about absurd humor? I don't mean to say that the Murderbot saga is silly, as its critique of humanity is very well-directed, but the fact is that if we analyze the genre and look at the bookshelves, it seems there's only room for works that aspire to create complex universes (and which rarely succeed).\n\nI'd like to find more authors who aren't so self-important and who present simple situations, routine missions with some unexpected twists, and with believable characters, as is done here. Really, nothing more is needed. The topic of artificial intelligence is already everywhere, especially from the fearmongering perspective, so I appreciate lighter and more rewarding proposals like this one.\nLike\nComment"}

I really liked Murderbot's voice, but on the other hand, I was so confused the whole time. Too many systems! I understood nothing! Also, like? It felt very low stakes? Because we know that Murderbot is, well, a murderbot operating outside the control of any bad actors (besides, potentially, himself). So there was never a sense of peril or drama. He was just dryly narrating his extreme competence in a detached and technical way, which: I love most of those things individually -- dryness, competence, and detachment, I mean; technical, I can take or leave -- but in this case the combo, plus the all systems-induced bafflement, kept me from getting properly invested.\n\nCurious to see if I enjoy it more as the series goes on.

The book being entirely in first person, compared to the show, required them to expand the other characters beyond just Murderbot's limited understanding. A couple other adjustments to specific events to add some more drama, and get you got yourself a solid adaptation.\n\nAll that said, most of my favorite moments of the TV show are Murderbot's internal monologues, and this book delivers that near constantly, so I think I came out preferring the book! Definitely excited to read more.\n\nI was shocked at how short it ended up being, though. Guess I have been reading a lot of much longer books, and I forgot that sometimes shorter novels can exist. Weird! And kind of as a result more impressive that they managed to turn it into eight full episodes, too.\nLike\nComment"}

I love that they are space hippies and the way they approach things as opposed to the more capitalistic groups. They're silly at times but are a good model for how to exist together. I also love the ending. I think its the most (I was actually going to say \"human\" ending but I realize that that word doesn't actually work. Basically what I want is like the adjective for human in all its mental and emotional parts without the baggage of what is considered to be physically required to be human. although I suppose just leaving off the physical doesn't quite work either since he is different in those aspects as well. As much as I loathe Orson Scott Card I think a word that I like is Ramen from Speaker for the Dead meaning a stranger recognized as \"human\" but that is of another species. So, \"human\" but not human) ending. A part also of what I love about this book is that Murderbot is \"human\" without being human. I like that Murderbot can be an it and doesn't need to be human to be worthy of respect and rights. Another thing that I just love about this series is that it is a series of shorter stories. It really feels like its taking the space and time necessary to tell the different parts of the story without the need to try and fit the mold of a full length novel. Very refreshing in that sense.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-12-23", "text": "Melanie\n1,619 reviews\n45 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 15, 2025\n3.25 stars\n\nI read the first three books in the Murderbot series - All Systems Red, Artificial Condition, and Rogue Protocol. I'm reviewing them together since I have similar feelings about each of these books.\n\nI'm not generally a sci-fi reader, but I've heard good things about this series from a number of different sources, and I do like expanding my reading horizons. I decided to listen to the first three books since together they are about the length of a regular novel.\n\nMurderbot is a SecUnit, aka a Security Unit, aka a killing machine. SecUnits are bots with some organic features that make them appear mostly (or at least partially) human. They exist in a future highly capitalistic society where companies sell rights to planetary research and development. Murderbot is rented out as a required part of packages granting rights, and his job is to protect his team at all costs, which often involves the murder of any threats.\n\nMurderbot, however, is different. He's been able to disconnect his governor module, which previously required him to obey orders, and act autonomously, although this is a fact he's trying to conceal, as absolutely no one would be okay with a rogue SecUnit. Rather than doing his job, he basically just wants to spend hours watching the future version of Netflix - very relatable! Yet despite his urge to tune out, Murderbot finds that he actually does care. In each of the first three volumes he finds himself in situations where he takes an active role in protecting a group of humans. He's also interested in investigating an incident from his past that caused him to give himself the nickname Murderbot (this is an ongoing storyline throughout the first three volumes in the series).\n\nThe series starts in media res, with us jumping into the action and slowly getting pieces of information that help us make sense of the world. While I appreciate not having to wade through pages and pages of worldbuilding (as is sometimes the penchant in sci-fi novels), it also made for a slightly disorienting experience. What Murderbot is doing is pretty easy to follow, but why things are happening sometimes took a bit longer for me to wrap my head around.\n\nThese books are short and super fast-paced, probably even too fast-paced. In the first book, the climax of the drama was over almost as soon as I realized what was going on. I wouldn't mind a bit more world-building and explanation and denouement. Also, in a world where so much communication happens over various feeds, Murderbot and his allies seem to be able to easily hack into any system that they need access to, but they rarely have to worry about being hacked into. That part felt a little too easy and convenient to me.\n\nI enjoyed these books and definitely see why others like them. That being said, I don't think I'll continue with the series. My curiosity has been satiated and there are many other books I want to read. I know there's a series adaptation out on AppleTV, which I would be interested in watching if I had access to that platform.\n2025\n \naudiobooks\n \nsci-fi-fantasy\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-09-14", "text": "Jeremy\n88 reviews\nFollow\nSeptember 14, 2025\nSolidly okay. The book is compromised of two separate stories. The first is pretty much strictly an introduction to the character. You learn who the murderbot is, what their life is about (watching TV, mostly) and what drives them. Outside of this, the plot is threadbare on the first and I struggled to get through it. It’s not bad, it just wasn’t interesting.\n\nThe second story was much, much better, as they introduced characters that could actually keep up and converse with good ol’ murderbot. It let their personality show through more and make them develop beyond the robot equivalent of Garfield. Again, the main thing driving the story is secondary to the character, but this one was quite a bit more interesting that the first.\n\nOverall a pretty good read. If you’re a sci fi head then dive in, you’ll get something that sates the craving for a cool universe.\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-09-14", "text": "Rose Tea\n61 reviews\n3 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 14, 2025\na strange one. Despite the story being quite exciting - i found the writing extremely flat, and the lack of description meant it was impossible to picture any of the characters except murderbot, or in fact any of the planet they were on. I also found murderbots internal dialogue very repetitive, how many times does he need to say he doesn't care about humans? an element I found confusing - he professes to be indifferent to humans multiple times, but is obsessed with watching soap operas. except soap operas fundamentally hang on our emotional investment in characters. they are quite literally human drama. considering these two opposing features are the main hooks of murderbot's personality, even though I enjoyed the murderbots narrative on the whole, I felt the author maybe hadn't created a fully cohesive character. yet. I understand there are several more books to go so perhaps he is fleshed out later on.\nLike\nComment"}

Murderbot’s voice is definitely the best part — sarcastic, awkward, and surprisingly relatable for a rogue security bot who just wants to watch TV. The story is short and easy to read, with fun action and some interesting ideas about freedom and what it means to be human.\n\nThat said, it felt a bit too short. Just when I was getting into it, it was over. The humor started to feel repetitive, and the human characters didn’t have much depth compared to Murderbot. It also ends pretty open, so it didn’t completely satisfy me as a standalone.\n\nOverall, it’s a quirky, quick read with a unique narrator.

I was blown away by how much I loved All Systems Red. People had been telling me for ages that I needed to give Murderbot a try, and now I’m kicking myself for waiting so long.\n\nWe follow a SecUnit, part robot and part organic, who has hacked itself and quietly nicknamed itself Murderbot. Despite the name, it is way more relatable than you would think. Murderbot’s voice is funny, awkward, and strangely human, and I found myself connecting with it immediately.\n\nWhat really impressed me was how approachable this book was. I’m not usually a big sci-fi reader because I tend to get lost in the heavy, confusing worldbuilding at the start of most books. But Wells eases you in, giving just enough detail to ground you without slowing down the story. The novella length worked perfectly too, short enough to binge in one sitting (or two for us slower readers) but never felt like it was missing anything.\n\nThis is not a book with a super intricate mystery or deep side character development, but that is not what it is trying to be. It is a fast-paced, snarky, and surprisingly heartfelt story about a robot who just wants to be left alone to watch TV.\n\nI’ll definitely be continuing the series, and luckily there are SEVERAL more novellas already out so I don’t even have to wait! This is perfect for readers looking for a quick, bingeable sci-fi with an antisocial robot narrator who will win you over in no time.\naudio\n \nhumor\n \nnovella\n \n...more\n8 likes\n1 comment\nLike\nComment"}

It took me a while to understand what was happening because the book jumps you straight in. I like that the story is from the robot’s point of view. Reminds me of I, Robot a little bit (can robots have feelings and are they more than machines?). I’m interested to read more in the series.\nLike\nComment"}

I went in with really high expectations, with many people telling me it was hilarious and one of the best series ever written. Unfortunately for me I didn't find it all that funny and it wasn't the best series ever written (imo). It was good, I liked the story and characters, I liked that it was fast paced and kept my attention but there was something missing. I did not like the end.\nLike\nComment"}

You will have to excuse me because this entire series is about to consume my entire soul.\n\n09/18/25 - I ended up rereading this entire book. I did it while sending emails and working. I strongly suspect Murderbot would appreciate that. I think I loved the book even more the second time. I wonder how many times i will listen to this book before I die. Probably an obscene amount of times. And yes, I will add to my review each time I do. Thanks, Murderbot, for getting me through this entire shitty week. I mean, I wasn't getting shot at so I really shouldn't complain. But I relate to the tedium of the day to day and to just trying to survive our corporate overlords I guess.\nace-rep\n \naudio\n \nlibrary\n1 like\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-09-08", "text": "Amy Leigh\n549 reviews\n2 followers\nFollow\nSeptember 8, 2025\nThis book lived up to the hype. It's a quick read, officially a novella instead of a novel. It tells the story of a SecUnit robot/human hybrid that calls itself Murderbot. The unit is awkward around humans and really just wants to Netflix and chill (literally--none of that human contact stuff) or watch whatever the equivalent of Netflix is a few centuries into the future.\n\nIt is assigned to a crew on an exploratory mission to a distant planet. Its job is to keep the human crew safe and report to its boss, the Company. But the Murderbot has hacked its governor module and doesn't have to obey commands the humans give it. When danger appears in the form of a rogue crew, Murderbot must figure out a way to save its mostly not terrible crew of humans.\n\nThe book was sharply funny and highly original. Great read!\nLike\nComment"}

{"username": "", "date": "2025-09-08", "text": "Michelle\n145 reviews\nFollow\nSeptember 8, 2025\n5/5 ⭐\n\n\nQuick Summary: All Systems Red is a science fiction novella about a self-aware, hacked security unit (\"Murderbot\") on a planetary survey mission. Murderbot, despite its name and desire to be left alone, becomes entangled in protecting the humans it's assigned to after an attack. \n\n\"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\"\n\nMy Thoughts: I loved reading this short novella and am already on book 3! It's a nice departure from super thick book I read recently lol. All Systems Red shows the nature of humanity through the lens of an introverted, slightly depressed, tv-obsessed cyborg figuring out who is in this world, that he is worthy of love and freedom, and what to do with his life when he's given the choice. I love murderbot! He's so likeable and thought-provoking. Such a fun read!\nLike\nComment"}
