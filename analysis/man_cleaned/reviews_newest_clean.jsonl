{"username":"3rian","date":1766275200000,"review_text":"I was still in a sci-fi mood after my last read but also wanted something on the shorter side. This was awesome, introducing an immediately likeable lead while packing in cool world-building, creepy tension, and exciting action scenes, all within about 150 pages. I immediately clicked with the main character's vibe, a deadly for-hire security robot that's secretly overridden its company's ability to control it, primarily using that freedom to quietly binge-watch television dramas during its downtime. The writing has a lot of fun with character's mindset, with the robot mildly annoyed by and uncomfortable around the humans it still genuinely wants to protect. Highly enjoyable! I'll certainly come back for more. 1 like"}

If you told me this was AI slop, I would believe you. At best, it reads like fanfiction, yet I've read plenty of fanfiction that works much harder at being entertaining than this. I thought Murderbot (both the character and the book) was supposed to be unique, quirky, droll. Instead, neither has any personality whatsoever.

{"username":"Huhn","date":1765843200000,"review_text":"In einer von Gro\u00dfkonzernen beherrschten Ecke der Galaxis hat das Bot-Klon-Konstrukt SecUnit erfolgreich sein governor module gehackt. Aber statt zum Massenmord an nervigen Menschen entscheidet es sich lieber daf\u00fcr, die neugewonnene Freiheit dazu zu nutzen, den ungeliebten Job als Security-Einheit nurmehr mit der halben Arschbacke zu erledigen und mit der anderen H\u00e4lfte seines immensen Arbeitsspeichers eine Menge Serien zu streamen. Bl\u00f6d nur, dass es sich ungeahnt empathisch dabei anstellt, als es zwei Klient*innen davor rettet, von einem besonders gefr\u00e4\u00dfigen Alien zu Tode gemampft zu werden. Jetzt wollen einige Menschen mit SecUnit sprechen. Am Ende noch mit Blickkontakt. Der pure Horror! (Leute, ich hab die Reihe jetzt bis auf den letzten halben Band am St\u00fcck weggesuchtet \u2026 ich habe zu wenig geschlafen und f\u00fchle mich, als h\u00e4tte ich einen nicht geringen Anteil meiner Hirnkapazit\u00e4t gespacet und habe mich beim Schreiben dieser Review in einen regelrechten Buchstabenrausch geschrieben. Ich entschuldige mich jetzt schon f\u00fcr meinen Redeschwall. Unten einmal meine Gedanken zur gesamten Buchreihe, dann kann ich mich in den folgenden Reviews kurz zu den Einzelb\u00e4nden \u00e4u\u00dfern. tl;dr: Die Buchreihe ist klasse. Selten so begeistert gewesen.) Diese Buchreihe wurde mir von zwei Freundinnen unabh\u00e4ngig voneinander w\u00e4rmstens ans Herz gelegt und \u2026 siehattensorechtdiesesBuchistdasbesteseitgeschnittenBrotlestesalleesistsogutaaaaahhhh!!!! Lasst mich nicht anfangen zu schw\u00e4rmen, sonst bekomme ich einen Laberanfall der Sonderklasse und erz\u00e4hle euch ungefragt und szenengenau ausf\u00fchrlich, warum die ganze Murderbot-Reihe das Beste ist, was ich seit Monaten gelesen habe. *luftholt* Ich war langsam schon genervt davon, dass ich so viel Romance lese, obwohl ich auf die ganzen Sexszenen \u00fcblicherweise nicht mal besonderen Wert lege. Ich f\u00fcrchtete, dass ich vielleicht einfach verdumme und auf seichte Lekt\u00fcre stehe oder so. Aber nein, die Murderbot-Diaries haben mir gezeigt, warum ich sowas eigentlich lese und was ich darin suche. Ich habe sie endlich gefunden \u2013 die garantiert absolut sex- und romantikfreie Buchreihe, die ALL THE FEEELINGS und ALL THE INTERESTING AND LIKEABLE CHARACTERS erkundet! Wer h\u00e4tte es geahnt \u2026 Emotionen und Beziehungen sind so viel vielschichtiger als immer nur LiebeLiebeLiebe und dadurch, dass wir hier einem k\u00fcnstlichen Konstrukt folgen, das schon rein biologisch nullkommanull Interesse an dieser Art von Fortpflanzung hat, bleibt endlich der Raum, sich mit allem anderen zu befassen. Und es ist mindestens genauso spannend, verwirrend, aufregend, mitrei\u00dfend, einf\u00fchlsam, be\u00e4ngstigend, herzerw\u00e4rmend und herzzerreissend, zuzusehen, wie hier die Menschen, Konstrukte, Bots miteinander agieren. ALL THE DRAMA! Ein anderer Punkt \u2013 ich habe lange keinen Charakter gelesen, mit dem ich mich so sehr identifizieren konnte wie mit SecUnit\/Murderbot, wenn es keinen Bock mehr auf Menschen hat, ohne dabei Menschen grunds\u00e4tzlich zu hassen. Nicht, dass ich mich mit dem Gesicht zur Wand drehen w\u00fcrde, aber ich kann das Bed\u00fcrfnis danach gut nachempfinden und direkter Blickkontakt w\u00e4hrend eines nicht-intimen Gespr\u00e4chs ist die Gei\u00dfel der Menschheit, wenn ihr mich fragt (ich w\u00fcnschte, *ich* k\u00f6nnte mir eine Subroutine coden, die mich die gesellschaftlich erw\u00fcnschte Menge an Augenkontakt automatisch halten l\u00e4sst, w\u00e4hrend ich mein Blickfeld aktiv ignoriere und meine Gespr\u00e4chspartner*innen im Livestream \u00fcber meine Drohnenkamera anschaue). Und nein, ich w\u00fcsste nicht, dass ich autistisch bin. Aber ich glaube, dass viele Menschen, die zur Introvertiertheit und allgemeiner sozialer Unsicherheit neigen, in SecUnit einen sehr nachempfindbaren Charakter finden. Es ist aber sicher auch kein Zufall, dass so viele Autist*innen sich mit SecUnit identifizieren k\u00f6nnen. Ich habs auch sooo gef\u00fchlt, als SecUnit nach einem richtig beschissenen Tag einfach nur auf seinem ungem\u00fctlichen Plastikbett crashen und Serien schauen will. Ich gucke wenig Serien, aber ersetze geistig \u201eSerie schauen\u201c durch \u201egutes Buch lesen\u201c und schon bin ich dabei. Hey, ich habe definitiv Buchreihen, die mein Sanctuary Moon sind und aus denen ich Abschnitte auswendig rezitieren kann, um mich in Stresssituationen abzuregen. Feel you, SecUnit, feel you. Was ich auch gro\u00dfartig finde \u2013 Ich liebe es, Geschichten \u00fcber kompetente Charaktere zu lesen. Und abseits aller social awkwardness \u2013 wenns um seinen Job geht, ist SecUnit wirklich \u00fcberdurchschnittlich kompetent. Das ist SO befriedigend, wenn es sich durch Systeme hackt, schnelle und fundierte Entscheidungen trifft, Abw\u00e4gungen macht, Wahrscheinlichkeiten berechnet, Leute entwaffnet und Dinge zerschl\u00e4gt. SO! Befriedigend! In diesem Zusammenhang: Ich lese sonst nicht gerne SciFi-Technobabble. Oft steht er in Verbindung mit langen Beschreibungen von technischen Ger\u00e4ten oder astronomisch-physikalischen Erkl\u00e4rungen, die mich einfach nicht interessieren. In dieser Buchreihe ist der Technobabble eher im IT-Bereich angesiedelt und auch da reicht ein halbwegs oberfl\u00e4chliches Verst\u00e4ndnis davon, wie ein Code oder ein Netzwerk grunds\u00e4tzlich funktionieren, um folgen zu k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin Historikerin, nicht ITlerin \u2013 wenn ich das schaffe, schafft ihr das auch! Ich habe dank der Murderbot-Reihe zum ersten Mal verstanden, warum Leute sowas gerne lesen. Es war gar nicht anstrengend, sondern absolut m\u00fchelos und aber ich hatte gleichzeitig das Gef\u00fchl, total *smort* zu sein und alles voll zu durchschauen. Wieder: SO! Befriedrigend! Ich liebe es, dass das Aussehen der Personen recht sp\u00e4rlich beschrieben wird. Selbst von unserer Hauptfigur SecUnit erfahren wir im Verlauf der B\u00e4nde nur vage Informationen zum \u00c4u\u00dferen, abseits von \u201ein langen Klamotten siehts wie ein Mensch mit Dataport im Nacken aus\u201c. Das gelingt in anderen B\u00fcchern nicht so gut, aber hier werden die Figuren \u00fcber ihr Verhalten, ihre Art zu sprechen und ihre Beziehungen untereinander so gut charakterisiert, dass das Aussehen so weit in den Hintergrund tritt, dass es tats\u00e4chlich so egal ist, wie es sein sollte. Davon abgesehen lese ich ohnehin nicht gern lange Beschreibungen vom Aussehen, weil ich insbesondere Frisuren und Klamotten auch einfach nicht sehr interessant finde. Urban Fantasy und Romance sind voll von solchen Beschreibungen und es k\u00f6nnte mir nicht egaler sein, welche Jeans die Figur heute tr\u00e4gt. Die Murderbot-Diaries entlasten hier meinen Arbeitsspeicher beim Lesen, indem das beschrieben wird, was ich wissen will. Und nicht das, was die Autorin oder der Autor meinen, mir unbedingt vermitteln zu m\u00fcssen, damit ich mir alles richtig\u2122 vorstelle. Naja und dann sind die gesellschaftlichen und sozialen Verh\u00e4ltnisse angenehm und unaufdringlich dargestellt. Verschiedene romantische Beziehungen der Menschen geh\u00f6ren zu deren Hintergr\u00fcnden, werden aber nicht tiefer thematisiert oder als Besonderheit herausgestellt. Das verleiht ihnen geb\u00fchrende Selbstverst\u00e4ndlichkeit und l\u00e4sst \u2013 wieder \u2013 Platz f\u00fcr weitere, interessante Aspekte. Ok, wir wissen, dass Dr. Mensah zwei Ehepartner*innen und einige Kinder zuhause hat. Das ist cool \u2013 aber ist nicht ihr einziger definierender Faktor, denn rein zuf\u00e4llig ist sie au\u00dferdem politische Entit\u00e4t, wissenschaftliche Fachfrau und eine energische Anf\u00fchrerin. Und nicht frei von Fehlern. Insbesondere konzentriert sich die ganze Buchreihe - neben der formidablen Action - auf die Frage, wer SecUnit ist und was es will vom Leben. Damit in Verbindung stehen Fragen danach, was es \u00fcberhaupt ausmacht, eine Person zu sein, wie eine Person behandelt werden sollte, welche Rechte wem geb\u00fchren. Wer \u00fcber wen bestimmen darf und was das jeweils impliziert. Steht nat\u00fcrlich, abseits der SciFi auch damit in Verbindung, was uns als Menschen ausmacht und wie wir miteinander umgehen sollten. Ich sehe realweltlich durchaus auch Parallelen zu Tierrechtsdebatten, aber jetzt schweife ich endg\u00fcltig ab. Ah, ich k\u00f6nnte ewig so weiterschw\u00e4rmen! \u00c4hm ja. Also, man merkt es kaum, aber ich bin restlos begeistert und fahre einen serotoningeschw\u00e4ngerten Lekt\u00fcretrip der Sonderklasse. Vielleicht lese ich die Reihe, wenn ich durch bin, auch einfach nochmal von vorne, bis im Mai der n\u00e4chste Band erscheinen soll. So. *geht weiterlesen* 2 likes"}

{"username":"Simon","date":1765756800000,"review_text":"Martha Wells' \"All Systems Red\" introduces readers to Murderbot, a security unit that has hacked its governor module to gain autonomy. Despite its newfound freedom, Murderbot prefers to binge-watch media and avoid human interaction. However, it's stuck with a team of scientists on a survey mission on a distant planet. The story is told from Murderbot's cynical and introverted point of view, offering a unique perspective on the interactions between humans and AI. As the team explores the planet, they discover evidence of a previous, failed expedition and soon realize they are not alone. The character development in \"All Systems Red\" is one of the strongest aspects of the novella. Murderbot is a fascinating and relatable protagonist, despite being an AI construct. Its internal monologue is filled with sarcasm, anxiety, and a surprising amount of empathy. The human characters are also well-drawn, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. The relationship between Murderbot and the scientists evolves throughout the story, as they gradually come to trust and rely on each other. One of the major plot twists involves the revelation that the previous expedition was deliberately sabotaged, leading to a deadly confrontation with a rival corporation. The tone of \"All Systems Red\" is a blend of action, humor, and introspection. Wells expertly balances the fast-paced plot with moments of quiet reflection, allowing readers to delve into Murderbot's complex inner world. The novella is filled with witty banter and sarcastic observations, providing plenty of laughs along the way. However, it also explores deeper themes about identity, freedom, and the nature of humanity. Thematically, \"All Systems Red\" explores the question of what it means to be human, even for a non-human entity. Murderbot's struggle to understand its own emotions and motivations is a central theme of the story. The novella also touches on issues of corporate greed, environmental exploitation, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. Ultimately, \"All Systems Red\" is a story about finding connection and purpose in a hostile universe. In conclusion, \"All Systems Red\" is a thrilling and thought-provoking novella that offers a fresh take on the science fiction genre. Martha Wells has created a memorable protagonist in Murderbot, and the story is filled with action, humor, and heart. For readers who enjoy \"All Systems Red,\" I recommend \"A Fire Upon the Deep\" by Vernor Vinge, which also features complex AI characters and epic space battles, and \"The Martian\" by Andy Weir, which combines scientific accuracy with a compelling survival story. read-before-watching"}

{"username":"Thomas Govert","date":1765670400000,"review_text":"While some might balk at neurodivergence representation in a robot, android, or cybernetic organism, the author is able to make a machine seem the most human, charming and relatable of all the characters in the book by showcasing the machine's own idiosyncrasies within a cast of diverse characters. It became uncannily easy to understand the machine's thought processes and choices and root for the seemingly cold, distant machine designed to murder. Turns out the metal assassin you're flying with isn't calculating how to murder you, but disassociating and trying to watch their stories on the work hour. This was a witty, fast-paced, intriguing, and action packed sci-fi story that was able to trust the audiences with their characters and plot without any filler, extraneous exposition, or dizzying world building. An infinitesimal, personal complaint about the audiobook...almost wished the reader was British.

Also, what were the humans doing on that planet, and what were they searching for? Why did Murderbot kill those people before he got reprogrammed? I needed more details, and that\u2019s why I liked the show because it filled in some of the gaps for me, and I would have been way more lost if I hadn\u2019t seen it.

What really elevates this to five stars is how much it says with so little page count. Themes of autonomy, consent, trauma, and personhood are woven in effortlessly. No speeches, no bloat, just clean, efficient storytelling. I came for the action. I stayed for the existential dread, the found-family vibes, and the deeply relatable desire to avoid eye contact forever. 1 like 1 comment"}

{"username":"Ozan","date":1765497600000,"review_text":"Murderbot internal dialogue: I have to write a review for my own book? Really? Great\u2026 This was not in my original contract. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m doing this. I would prefer almost anything else. Reformatting my media storage. Staring at a wall while running diagnostics. Dismembering my own hands - except that wouldn\u2019t actually stop me from writing the review and then I\u2019d still have to do it without hands, which feels inefficient. Let me summarize The Murderbot Diaries for you: When I could be watching an episode of The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, I keep having to save people from the problems they brought upon themselves. The series is basically that situation. On repeat. It\u2019s entertaining,familiar and somehow I\u2019m the most humane character in the story. Or so the humans say. Reviewing each book separately doesn\u2019t make much sense to them anyway. Their brains can\u2019t process the series as individual units. What they remember is the feeling\u2014a similar emotional state repeating across short novellas. We assess the threat. (I assess the threat) We execute the plan. (In three long corporate cycles.) We move on. And yes, most of the time, the threat is human behavior. Then it\u2019s over. Which is unfortunate, because now we have free time again and people might try to talk to me. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026 I have 124 new episodes to watch. favorites 1 like"}

{"username":"Ainsley Deeble","date":1765497600000,"review_text":"3.5 \u2b50\ufe0f This read like the perfect humour of an actor in a movie breaking the fourth wall to address the audience to say something we\u2019re all thinking. Murderbot is a rogue security robot who has overridden his programming to allow himself to make decisions of his own, and most importantly, watch TV and movies. He literally wants nothing more than to be left alone and to not have to deal with humans, which is ironic seeing as his exact job is to protect humans that he is assigned to. He finds emotions annoying, admits to half assing work, thinks humans are dumb and has funny commentary on all the little social routines\/oddities humans all do for the sake of pleasantry and going through the motions. This book also had a crazy amount of plot and world building for a novella! Super fun tech, lots of action and I would definitely see myself continuing the series on car trips. Is it a crazy stand out impressive story? No. Was I emotionally moved or on the edge of my seat? No! But it was fun and engaging from start to finish 9 likes"}

How is it that this book is so popular and won so many awards? I saw exactly zero redeeming qualities within its pages. Murderbot wasn't funny or charming, but rather just sort of lazy and anxious. At no point did I care about the events on that planet. Let's break down the entire story: some greedy buggers tried to kill the main characters, murderbot was there. Then it's all over. I had the beginnings of a glimmer of caring when I thought the crew would not trust MB after they learned more about him. But, no, that wasn't a problem. Too many characters! No idea how many, it boiled down to the boss and the guy MB didn't like. And all the rest. Let me tell you about the universe where this all happens. Well, there is a corporation and it's cheap.

Once I got used to it, it flowed and the story was great, but it was rough to start. I love that even though Murderbot is a construct, the team treats them as a person and eventually accept them as such when they \"free\" them and bring them to be part of their family. I also understand Muderbot's choice to run away and find themselves, as it has had never been able to do so. I am excited to read the others, but definitely will keep my expectations lower than I did for this one. favorites-2025 other-challenge-reads scifi ...more"}

{"username":"READERSBEWARE","date":1765238400000,"review_text":"Reading All Systems Red felt like slipping into the mind of someone who\u2019s already given up on being understood. Murderbot\u2019s voice is sardonic, numb, and strangely heartbreaking \u2014 a creature built for violence, wired for obedience, yet quietly desperate to disappear into the comforting static of its media feeds. The isolation hits hardest: it moves through the world surrounded by people it\u2019s meant to protect, yet it never believes it belongs beside them. That loneliness, wrapped in humor sharp enough to border on self-defense, makes the story feel less like sci-fi adventure and more like a confession from someone who never asked to exist. What lingers isn\u2019t the danger the characters face but the way Murderbot constantly assumes the worst of itself. Every time it steps between humans and harm, there\u2019s this sense of weary inevitability \u2014 like it\u2019s bracing for the moment its usefulness runs out. Its internal monologue reads like someone trying to shrink out of their own story, terrified of being seen, yet unable to stop caring in the small, reluctant ways that hurt the most. Even when the plot accelerates into tense survival, that low thrum of self-loathing never really fades; it just hides under the action beats. By the end, the book doesn\u2019t offer comfort so much as a grim acknowledgment of what it means to keep going when connection feels dangerous and identity feels like a wound. The story is short, almost brutally so, and it leaves you with the sense that Murderbot\u2019s journey is far from healing \u2014 it\u2019s merely the first step of someone who knows freedom won\u2019t magically make them whole. And maybe that\u2019s what makes this little novella so quietly devastating: beneath the armor, the algorithms, and the dry humor, Murderbot feels painfully human in its desire to stay unseen\u2026 and its inability to stop caring anyway. 1 like"}

A security robot designed for killing hacks its own restrictions and does the least amount of work possible while watching soap operas. This time murder bot is on a planet with some researchers excavating and solving a murder mystery of sorts. Positives: I liked the subtle comedy in this and obviously the premise is the best part. \"the concept\" of a killer robot just switching over and only caring about soap operas is pretty funny and played to fair effect here. I think Martha potentially going for a portrayal of autism through main character which is a cool way to do it but could be a little tricky given they are not fully human idk. Any autistic people, I would love to hear your thoughts Negatives: book was maybe a tad too short where the mystery did not feel all the way fleshed out, but I understand given the nature of this series to be a large collection of small little adventures. Murderbot felt pretty flat which yes they are robot but at the same time felt like author was just running the same route ad nauseam.

{"username":"Bree Hatfield","date":1764979200000,"review_text":"This novella felt like a spin-off story in a much larger series \u2014 the world is fully developed and richly realized, and the audience is just expected to get it. I felt like I understood about 75% of what was going on most of the time. I know that was an intentional choice, but it\u2019s not one I like very much. I prefer it when I get to discover the world as the story progresses. Minor spoilers ahead. The other major problem was that every character except for Murderbot was cardboard. None of them had any distinguishable personalities, and I could barely tell them apart. I slowly began to parse their individual identities by the end, but then Murderbot leaves them. So what was the point? Murderbot\u2019s declaration that Mensah was his favorite human at the end just rang hollow. For this whole novel, we\u2019re in Murderbot\u2019s head. Martha Wells is very good at portraying his internal struggle and development, and Murderbot\u2019s character arc is what drives this novella and makes it worth reading. BUT, I think that\u2019s also why the other characters fell so flat. Clearly Wells is good at characterization, but with such a strict point of view, she constricts herself. Because of the lack of visible character development for the human characters, the actual plot fell extremely flat for me too. Why should I care about what\u2019s going on with the weird planet when Murderbot doesn\u2019t? The climax is somewhat interesting, but only because Murderbot has a personal stake in it. Murderbot also warms up to the humans VERY quickly. At the start, they don\u2019t care about the crew at all, but about an hour in they\u2019re extremely protective of them? It didn\u2019t make much sense. I think the idea is that these humans are the first to show genuine compassion toward them, which is great in concept, except that Murderbot previously stated that they didn\u2019t care what the humans thought of them at all. This is part of a much larger issue, though; this novella should have been a full-length novel. Just about every aspect of this book needed more elaboration and more development. Murderbot is very relatable, very funny, and extremely compelling. I absolutely love their arc in this book \u2014 they learned that to truly find yourself, you need compassion and determination. Mensah and her crew showed them compassion, and because of that they had the determination to do what was good. They still don\u2019t know who they are, but they know what it means to be sentient. And that is a beautiful character arc, which sets up their further development wonderfully. And in a way, this could be interpreted as a story about how powerful fiction is and the impact it has on the psyche. Murderbot learns a lot about how to live well by watching media. The issue is that we don\u2019t get much of any description of the media they watch, but still. It\u2019s nice. This was a good book, but not quite as good as everyone says. After watching the show, it\u2019s abundantly clear that this novella needed to be a novel; all the elements of greatness are here (interesting characters, fun plot, emotional character arcs, etc.), but Wells basically speed-runs the whole story in 150 pages. If it was 200 pages longer, it would have been a masterpiece. As it is, it\u2019s just okay. Also, the constant use of \u201cit\u201d as a single pronoun felt so odd to me. Even after the crew found out that Murderbot was sentient, they still used \u201cit.\u201d This is a queer-normative world, just use \u201cthey\u201d! I know Murderbot doesn\u2019t care, but Murderbot isn\u2019t a thing. They\u2019re a person. Use a pronoun that befits a person. Also, why the hell would he choose \u201cMurdebot\u201d as a name? Just because it\u2019s funny? If that is the reason, why wouldn\u2019t they change their name at the end of the story once they have a more serious view of their own sentience? It just doesn\u2019t make much sense. 2025 queer science-fiction 1 like"}

Themes of violence and death, many combat related injuries (though not overly graphic in description). Redeeming themes of compassion, problem solving and team work. Looking forward to continuing this series! 1 like"}

{"username":"Sara Seyfarth","date":1764806400000,"review_text":"I love science fiction, and I see mentions of this series all the time, so I\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to read it. I definitely had the perception that it would be fairly dark, so maybe it was that. At any rate, it was completely different from what I was anticipating. My biggest issue, frankly, is the length, and that\u2019s really only to say that I enjoyed it enough that I wished it were longer. I went into it not realizing it was written as a novella, so that likely colored my reaction. The world-building is really interesting, but it does feel introductory. The world we\u2019re presented with is pretty dark \u2013 this is a system with very little care or empathy (on an uninhabited planet, there\u2019s an expectation that equipment is poorly made) and there are references to deeply questionable treatment of the not-entirely-human \u2013 but my understanding of the world is pretty limited, and I\u2019m left with a lot of questions. Since this is a series, I\u2019m happy that I\u2019ll get to dive back into this world and learn more. This is a really fun, quick read that made me laugh out loud multiple times, which I wasn\u2019t expecting. The tone is everything here. Murderbot is a new favorite character; its voice is delightfully droll and its thought processes are interesting, concrete, and at times, hilarious. The characterization, for me, steals the spotlight because Wells manages to balance Murderbot\u2019s humor with its tragic background and place in the world. I love that the novella is thought-provoking without feeling preachy or pulling the reader from the story while also delivering some great comedy. Perhaps because I listened to this on audio, I did have some difficulty with keeping the rest of the characters straight. They were all well imagined, and by the end I felt I knew a few, but I would have liked some additional development so they all felt clearer earlier in the story. This was also a really quick read (so quick that I verified twice that I hadn\u2019t inadvertently chosen the abridged audiobook before realizing that it\u2019s a novella \ud83d\ude02), and the plot moved at warp speed. I love a fast-moving story, but again I felt some additional development wouldn\u2019t have gone awry. The mystery was solved in a fairly mundane way when I\u2019d hoped there would be a little more to it. The ending also felt a little rushed. Overall, I really enjoyed this one and look forward to reading more in the series. audio science-fiction"}

I know this too is sacrilege to say, even for me, but\u2026 I think I liked the show better? The show really leaned into and fleshed out the society from which the humans Murderbot is assigned to protect come, and paint it as an absurdist inevitable conclusion of centuries of political correctness. Kind of hilarious, and glossed over, for the most part, in the book. Plus, I know this is not a fair comparison, but whoever was the reader of the audiobook?

{"username":"Elena","date":1765756800000,"review_text":"All Systems Red by Martha Wells is a book about a SecUnit who calls itself Murderbot. This robot is hacked, so it hides its independence from its clients. It much prefers watching media then doing its job anyway. When it and its clients discover a deadly sabotage, Murderbot has to realize that it might care a little for the humans it\u2019s protecting. This book is part of a seven book series which contains both novellas and novels. The main character felt shockingly real. Its detached and nonchalant behavior created a funny and entertaining narrator. I felt like I was just along a ride, and I was very curious what would happen regarding the sabotage. Some scenes made me feel satisfied and some made me feel mildly sad. I did feel a bit confused at the climax, I understood most of it but there were some parts that made me feel a bit confused, but that is probably just me. Overall, I would give this book a solid thumbs up. It was well written and a fun idea. I would recommend it to someone who does not like reading, because the books are short and action packed. They are quick and satisfying. The world created by Martha Wells is very detailed. I would not be shocked if the future came up with similar inventions like that in the future. A lot of the issues that I would think would be transferred\/unresolved in the future also came up. Many of the aspects in the book had vague similarities to the current world.

{"username":"Kayla","date":1764720000000,"review_text":"I have some mixed feelings on this one. On the one hand, I really enjoyed almost every aspect of it. I liked the world, I liked the characters, I liked the prose. The mystery was really cool, and I liked learning about the world through the POV character\u2019s eyes, though I feel the POV is the ultimate downfall of the story. I get that the main character is fundamentally disinterested in a lot of what goes on in the world, but I just needed more details. I wanted to know more about the previous incident that made them the way they are. This element hangs over the first half of the narrative, supposing to be some mysterious inciting event, but is revealed and discussed in its entirety in about two sentences. The ongoing mystery throughout had such cool potential, but again is revealed with no fanfare or further discussion. The reveal didn\u2019t even really seem all that important. I\u2019m given the facts of why I should care about these things, but the way they are presented had almost no emotional impact on me. And yet, despite all these critiques, I really liked the book! I\u2019m frustrated because I think these characters and this world is way cooler than the book makes it out to be. I found the end unsatisfying and too open, but in a way that all but guarantees I\u2019ll be picking up the next book. I\u2019m left with a lot of questions, but that in itself kind of has kept the story on my mind more than other books with a watertight narrative. The book is pretty short and punchy, but I wanted a bit more character study out of it, even if that meant the book needed to be longer. I always think wanting more book at the end of a book is a good criticism to have, because I was enjoying it! I think the fact that I did end up enjoying it so much despite the major parts I found lacking is a testament to how cool this world is, and how cool these characters are."}

It was a page turner the entire way through, despite me not reeeally caring about the plot; I\u2019m just here for vibes! There\u2019s still hints of a fun plot, setting, and themes, but again not deep given it\u2019s a novella. Themes hint on not punishing the whole for the actions of a small portion, exploring why we are motivated to be good even to those we owe nothing to, and simply being anti-social and not wanting to be observed or controlled by others.

I don't really have super strong complaints; nothing irked me to the point of oh wow I wanna drop this book. All aspects of the story were fun, but nothing was riveting; nothing felt deep or meaningful. I also considered, since we're reading Murderbot's internal dialogue, perhaps the author could have brought up certain issues\/themes relevant to its complex situation and role. But all Murderbot wants is to watch TV (it doesn't care enough about anything really. I guess it's one of its charms, why so many people like this series). My biggest dissatisfaction; perhaps it's due to the shortness of the novella, but there wasn't enough room for me to become fully invested in the rest of the characters (minus Murderbot) or the story itself. Ex) I wasn't really worried about the threats that our characters faced (I didn't care enough about them, idk); more so anticipated Murderbot's humorous narrations facing social anxiety. Hopefully this is something that will be resolved as I read the rest of the series. But overall, this was a fast, fun read I could enjoy without using too much brainpower. Like a quick, sweet snack between huge gourmet meals that allows me to rest my stomach for a while (= rest my brain). A potential comfort read (like I said, that\u2019s crazy for a sci-fi novel)."}
{"username":"Amelia","date":1764720000000,"review_text":"I adore this series! The dry, detached writing style and Murderbot's unique but relatable perspective are just funny and real. But it took some effort to get there, and it requires some pretty active reading to get to this one's leaky little heart. I ended up relistening to the first twenty minutes of the audiobook because I realized I wasn't paying close enough attention. I was alerted to this fact when I was like, \"Wait a second... was it just me, or was what happened just now funny? Like... really funny?\" (It was.) I'm not even sure I truly fell in love with book one until I started book two, because book two gave me additional context that confirmed I was understanding book one correctly. But I still don't think I fully *got* what this series was doing until... book 4? Maybe even book 6? I would rate the series as a whole 5 stars, but find myself rating each individual piece 4 stars. Like Murderbot itself, the whole really is more than the sum of its parts. This is deeply rewarding, but also requires an investment not all readers will have. I think reading the first two books at least though gives you a solid flavor to decide whether you want to keep going! More than just book one on its own. In case it's not clear, I do strongly recommend it."}

I did enjoy the main character\u2019s hilarious blend of cynicism and social awkwardness. The plot itself moves quickly and wraps up in a satisfying way. Honestly, one of the things I appreciated most was the length. After trudging through several 500+ books lately, this felt refreshingly concise. The pacing is fast\u2014sometimes very fast\u2014but it works because it feels like we\u2019re experiencing events in real time through the MC\u2019s point of view. That said, the brevity comes with a cost: zero relationship development and almost no characterization for the supporting cast.

{"username":"Joe Hay","date":1764460800000,"review_text":"I thought this was pretty damn good (or, since this is a mass phenomenon, should I say \"I agree with the consensus that this is pretty damn good\"?). It pulls off an entertaining and moving action sci-fi story in a very streamlined and short package. At the heart of it is the voice of the narrator, a true zeitgeist, spirit of the times, the disembodied voice of a partially embodied era. I will say the facile thing and point out that this book owes a tremendous lot to Mary Shelley, but it's definitely of the now and is a worthy heir. Maybe it's the heir we've been waiting for, finally we get an interminably online So-and-so's Monster to learn about, briefly gasp at, but mostly love. I will avoid diving too much into the nature and mythology of the Murderbot, because I've only just waded into this world and have more to learn. Like all good symbols, the Murderbot is their own, only partially-definable thing and also many things. They're the stand in for the Objectified Human, the homunculus, the Hegelian bondsman, the dehumanized Other. The band of humans in the book are definitely aware of this dynamic and seem motivated to subvert it, motivated by what I read as a mixture of genuine empathy and enlightened savior complex. However, I think what could be interesting about the Murderbot - and I want to read more to find out - is their ability to embody the way men have uniquely been objectified in American culture - as killers, as expendable meat, as having no value outside their labor, as being without feeling - which is something that I have not seen in the spotlight very much in socially-informed literature. I hope it goes somewhere interesting. I also think the Murderbot's voice reflects a kind of antisocial and apathetic personality we currently tend to associate with Gen Z, which is interesting. That is, the avoidance of eye contact, fear of conversations, and complete rejection of industry as a virtue. I don't mean to judge. In many ways, these traits are responsible for making the narrator so relatable. I expect to have more to say about this as I read more of the series. I do think the book is noticeably flawed. The prose can be a little muddy, and I think there are more than a handful of sentences that I think could have been reworked. One could make the argument that this is the narrator, not the author, but I don't experience the mistakes as deliberate. I also think character development was spared for all but a couple of the key players, making the rest of the crew somewhat indistinguishable and difficult to keep track of. But these flaws don't sink the rest of it, and I'm looking forward to reading on. 1 like"}
{"username":"Amanda Brenner","date":1764547200000,"review_text":"Martha Wells delivers an engrossing novella that hooks the reader instantly with its unique premise and, more importantly, its unforgettable protagonist. The star of this show is a droid contracted to provide protection for a team of scientists conducting field research on a remote planet. This unit, however, has hacked its own governor module and prefers to call itself Murderbot. Murderbot is an anxious, media-obsessed entity whose primary goal is to perform the bare minimum of its duties so he can get back to binge-watching his favorite serialized dramas. His cynical observations, dry wit, and deeply relatable social awkwardness was unexpected, but made this novella stand out. Murderbot is surprisingly funny and, against all odds, heartwarming. All Systems Red is a fast, thrilling read that delivers complex characterization and action-packed suspense in under 150 pages. I highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique, funny, and surprisingly emotional sci-fi escape. 2025 audiobooks 3 likes 1 comment"}

Gripping story, interesting and charming characters, and some well-done social commentary, even if it wasn't super ground-breaking or anything. Just a small-scale and delightful story that is written in a compelling and straightforward way and manages to pull off some great world-building. I think my only complaint is she started to lose me with some of the technical detail in the last act, but mostly I found it really cool and I appreciate how all the sci-fi elements are genuinely relevant to the plot and mystery.

Wells sure threw an irresistible wind-up pitch on your hopes to read the next book ... This is why I can only give 4 stars. I'd rather have bought a novel than continue reading short excerpts, feeling like an addict following an expensive bread trail. Perhaps it will be revealed in the following books...Im a bit lost on the need to insert so many multiple partner relationships. It distracts from the main plot and character building and tad, even if the sole purpose is merely an odd hack at speculative science fiction and cultural world-building. For me, it immediately makes almost all the characters unrelatable. Perhaps robotic in a twist of irony."}

I found the \u201crobot-attains-consciousness\u201d theme more timely than ever; there\u2019s so much conversation about bad singularity, and less about a neutral or humane one. This novella hits that middle ground beautifully. A few things didn\u2019t land as well: the hybrid organic\u2013mechanical body concept could be clearer(Murderbot can feel pain sort of(?), bleed, regrow like I lizard does it's tail-- I found all this difficult to picture); some background crew members blurred together, and I wish their dialogue had been further reduced to keep focus on the ones with stronger ties to the main character.

{"username":"Dan","date":1764201600000,"review_text":"\u201cSecUnit would like to file a formal complaint: too many feelings, not enough media streaming.\u201d All Systems Red by Martha Wells came out in 2017 and kicks off The Murderbot Diaries with a pretty perfect balance of bite, boredom, and barely-contained chaos. The plot is simple enough. A security android has hacked its own governor system and is technically free but still stuck guarding a crew of humans on a survey mission. It would rather be doing literally anything else. Mostly watching media feeds and being left alone. But then corporate sabotage, mystery threats, and of course\u2026 feelings get in the way. The world is gritty without being overloaded with sci-fi jargon. The stakes are real. And the whole thing wraps up in a clean, tight novella that somehow manages to feel like a full story without overstaying its welcome. Murderbot is what makes it all work. That voice is weirdly relatable. Sarcastic, tired, often annoyed but still deeply competent. The way it reacts to people, stress, and even kindness feels believable, and more than a few scenes made me laugh out loud. The pacing never lags. It flies forward with a kind of breathless efficiency, but never feels rushed or empty. The plot knows what it wants to do and does it. There\u2019s no filler. It felt kind of refreshing to read something that knew exactly how long it needed to be and didn\u2019t try to puff itself up. Honestly, I could\u2019ve read another 100 pages of Murderbot just hating everything and I wouldn\u2019t have been mad. Solid 4\/5."}

{"username":"Pedro Pacheco","date":1764028800000,"review_text":"Recently I convinced my boyfriend to read the 'Malazan Book of the Fallen' series (one of my greatest achievements in life) and he commented that for him it's weird reading fantasy because he's so used to reading sci-fi and that his brain takes some time to adjust the thought process and world immersion. I've found out that I'm the opposite: fantasy books are natural to me, but apparently I struggle with sci-fi even if the book is short like this one. It's not that the book is complicated or that the world is complex, and it certainly isn't my first sci-fi book (although I don't read that many). It's just that I think I'm not that interested in sci-fi settings and the terminology and concepts are not as natural to me, especially considering that this is a super short book and, therefore, very focused on the action. Things are happening, people and robots are using systems with names like HubSystem and SecSystem and they're communicating through feeds that they can share or block and then there are guns coming out of a robot's arms and scanners and drones and hoppers and some are small and some are big and then the autopilot is malfunctioning and there's a system breach and suddenly my eyes are glazed over and I'm just reading words. The book itself was nice and entertaining and Murderbot is a great main character (although his awkwardness was a bit too much at times) and I somewhat enjoyed the fact that it is such a small book as it kept things focused, but also I somehow took way too long to read this because I wasn't fully immersed or invested. All in all, I liked it and I think I'll read the next books as they are all so short, but I think sci-fi is still a bit of a struggle for me. 1 like"}

{"username":"Shelleyrae at Book'd Out","date":1764806400000,"review_text":"\u201cI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\u2019t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\u201d Despite enjoying several sci-fi tv shows, I\u2019ve never been particularly drawn to reading the genre. Having said that, The Murderbot Diaries have been on my radar for years, so when I realised All Systems Red fit the prompt for a reading challenge the choice was easy. All Systems Red is the first in the series of novellas by Martha Wells (that will number 8 when Platform Decay is released in May 2026) introducing a hybrid organic android who calls itself Murderbot. Owned by The Company, Murderbot is one of dozens of \u2018SecUnits\u2019, deployed to protect people or property, or kill and destroy the same, as management decrees. Murderbot however, is different. After a system malfunction that resulted in the unsanctioned slaughter of fifty seven clients, Murderbot (who adopted the name as a result), hacked their own system, and secretly severed The Company\u2019s control. As the story opens, Murderbot, who keeps up the pretence of their programming lest The Company order their destruction, is accompanying a small group of non-profit scientists assessing the value of a planet\u2019s resources. The mission is entirely uneventful until suddenly it\u2019s not, and Murderbot is pulling a scientist from the mouth of a tunnelling carnivorous monster, sparring with a batch of hijacked SecUnits, faking out unscrupulous rival surveyors, and having to spend way too much time with humans when they\u2019d much rather be watching Sanctuary Moon. Buoyed by perfect pacing, it took me barely an hour to read All Systems Red. The action is fast-paced, the world simply portrayed, and Murderbot is immediately appealing. Cynical and stoic yet awkward and vulnerable, Murderbot has a surprisingly complexity. I enjoyed how the dynamic between Murderbot and the group of humans under his protection further informed his character. Despite the brevity of the novella format, Wells raises questions about identity, autonomy, and humanity, all with a delightfully deadpan sense of humour. An entertaining and easy read I\u2019m eager to devour the rest of the Murderbot Diary series and watch the recently released Murderbot series on AppleTV+. 2025-challenges 6 likes"}

{"username":"Lady Tea","date":1763856000000,"review_text":"Rating: 5 \"I don't cares\" \/ 5 Meet Murderbot: he it is what can only be described as an existential...AI? I think? I mean, it's described as having both \"organic\" and \"nonorganic\" parts, so tbh, I was just imagining something like General Grevious, except with more programming and less of an accent. And even that's not quite right, I'm sure of it, but it's the closest that I got. Anyway, it's pretty indifferent about life, and wants to live it the same as your ne'er-do-well 40s-year-old-man-living-in-his-parents-basement wants to live: by diving deep into entertainment (i.e. TV shows \/ movies) and not much else. It openly admits that it's a failure and only half-asses its job, but it legit doesn't care. The only time it actually does something is when it concludes that it actually likes the humans it's working for, and of course to keep under warps the fact that it's hacked its own programming and therefore gained some level of independence. It's...a fresh new concept, to say the least, and one that I was sure would require more than a novella to be fully explored. And yet...surprisingly enough, in about 150 pages, the author communicates absolutely everything she needs to, which surprised me. Maybe it's because the plot is pretty small-scale to begin with and the author doesn't try to make it seem like more than it is? Or maybe it's because she opted to NOT focus on extraneous details and literally just give us the bare-bones plot of what's happening and what we need to know. Well, in any case and whatever it is, I applaud her for it, and sincerely appreciate NOT having to wade through sci-fi spiel that will only either confuse or bore me. *claps for Martha Wells and for Murderbot* You've got yourself another fan! and-now-for-something-different audiobooks favourites-series ...more 3 likes"}

{"username":"Cat","date":1763856000000,"review_text":"Finally got to read this after watching the tv show. I love the snark, Dr. Mensah, and the poly-normative world. Murderbot\u2019s internal dialogue felt stilted and the more robotic parts not well integrated with the emotional sides. Which while consistent with the character\u2019s growth, didn\u2019t quite land for me. It was a bit too jarring. So, a novella! From little I\u2019ve gathered, Wells got to lead the new tv series, and I think all the additions to smooth out and extend the story were fantastic there. It fascinated me that there was almost no description of any character\u2019s appearance beyond clothing. It took me until the end to realize, when I realized I\u2019d been hearing the actors voices and had no idea if they matched their physical descriptions. It left me wondering what I would have assumed if I read this without the tv show to fill in the gaps. I\u2019ve been reading a lot of books with ASD coded characters, but they tend to have pretty mild presentation. Murderbot is more in the moderate range. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\u201d We\u2019re left wondering which things are coping mechanisms it\u2019ll grow out of and which are intrinsic. The contrast with Gurathin, who also seems mild ASD here (but more traumatized in the show) was also intriguing but didn\u2019t really get off the ground. I really appreciated getting this inside look, and am really curious about the next novellas (and hopefully tv seasons!) in this series."}

{"username":"Emily Clifton","date":1765065600000,"review_text":"Murderbot is a dry-humored, introverted, and cynically self-aware anthropomorphic AI who plays security for a team of scientists researching a relatively unknown planet. Even though I didn\u2019t find Murderbot relatable (I love making eye contact and socializing), its dispassionate narration and love for mindless entertainment easily won me over. In my opinion, you have to like Murderbot to like the book. While there are certainly other characters, Murderbot\u2019s prickly charm carries the story. Wells lays the groundwork for potentially great conversations around capitalism, media consumption, and autonomy, and I\u2019m excited to see where she takes them. The world-building seems promising too, so I will definitely be continuing with the series!

The whole group had been remarkably drama-free so far, which I appreciated. The last few contracts had been like being an involuntary bystander in one of the entertainment feed\u2019s multi-partner relationship serials except I\u2019d hated the whole cast. but not knowing nor understanding the human characters in detail was so frustrating. they were just\u2026names. to me. maybe it\u2019s bc it\u2019s a novella? not a novel? only after watching the first episode of the show could i go through the whole book bc the show gave me a better idea of the group and each individual. i\u2019m definitely listening to the next books after this. i just really love david cui cui\u2019s narration! his flattery is flat enough to be a robot yet with a tiny tinge of emotions to pull off narrating a rogue unit. but yeah, still just a 3-star from me. it was okay. not amazing or life-changing. the dramatized audio definitely makes it okay when the book by itself would have been given a 1,5 stars from me lol."}

{"username":"Sandra Castro","date":1763769600000,"review_text":"\"All Systems Red\" is a sharp, clever, and surprisingly heartfelt sci-fi novella that hooked me from the beginning. Martha Wells delivers a compact story that balances action, humor, and character depth in a way that feels effortless. Murderbot is easily the highlight: cynical, awkward, and deeply relatable despite being a security construct. Its inner monologue is hilarious in the driest way possible, but also unexpectedly moving as it wrestles with autonomy, identity, and the uncomfortable reality of caring about the humans it\u2019s supposed to ignore. The plot itself is tight and engaging. The isolated planetary setting creates a constant low-level tension, and the mystery surrounding the sabotage keeps the story propelling forward. Even though the book is short, the author builds the world clearly enough that you\u2019re immersed without ever feeling bogged down by exposition. Overall, \"All Systems Red\" is a fantastic start to the series: smart, funny and fast-paced short novella. libby 10 likes 1 comment"}

My primary reading genre is fantasy\/high fantasy\/romantasy, and so many new authors in this category tend to overwrite their books because they think if their books aren't girthy tomes then they won't be as \"epic\" or have a fleshed out fantasy world. This book is I think only a little over 100 pages (I read the audiobook so it was only 3 hours as opposed to the normal range of 10-20+ hours for many other books I read) and it told such a well-crafted story. I also never thought I would be relating to a character who calls itself \"murderbot\" or that said bot would be absolutely hilarious.

There is a fine balance between world overload and not enough information and this book did not reach it. Even by the end I wasn't entirely sure what Murderbot was. It was confusing. Maybe if I understood the world better, I would've enjoyed this book more. I didn't understand who the people were on this world, what they were doing there, what the villains were trying to protect - it just wasn't that enjoyable because too much information was missing. And I actually love mysteries, but with those there is a logical set up, which includes missing puzzle pieces. This one felt more like one of my 8 year old students trying to tell a complex story and leaving out all kinds of important information but I don't want to ask questions because they story was already going on too long. I read that some people found Murderbot amusing, but I didn't find him that intriguing. Not really a character that I'd want to know more.

Because of this I enjoyed how the supporting characters interacted with Murderbot.

I also think that having read this while also reading some more \u201ccomplex\u201d philosophically stimulating books like Asimov\u2019s Foundation (+Dune being a favourite of mine for years now), as well as some non-fiction science books, I often had to remind myself to notice All System\u2019s Red for what it is and avoid treating it as I feel it should be by comparison to other more notable works.

{"username":"T Davidovsky","date":1763510400000,"review_text":"Hilarious. Murderbot talks like an angsty teen on Tumblr, and as someone who was once an angsty teen on Tumblr, I am here for it. For the uninitiated, All Systems Red is about a cyborg\/robot who names itself Murderbot after secretly hacking into their own government module in order to free itself from its own programming. As a result, it has to learn what it's like to have feelings, like anxiety. It also learns about navigating relationships and just being a sentient, partially-organic being with some degree of free will. All it wants to do is watch bad television and avoid prolonged social interactions, but unfortunately for Murderbot, it's still a security unit (SecUnit). That means it gets assigned guard duty on dangerous missions, so there are serious stakes in this book. Also, the fact that Murderbot hacked into their own government module needs to be kept a secret. So it not only has to keep everyone on their mission alive, but also has to act normal. And unfortunately, socially anxious cyborgs aren't the best actors in the world. What ensues is very funny. It also raises important questions about relationships and what it means to be sentient. And underneath that, there's critique of corporate entities, which I imagine will get less subtle in later books. There's an element of both hopepunk and grit in here. Hopepunk, because there are collectivized and democratized planets that have completely reimagined how to organize society without problematic hierarchies, and I imagine we might see more of these societies in later books. But still gritty, because outside those hippy planets, there are corporate overlords worth fighting against."}

En ella, conocemos a Matabot, una Seg-Unidad \u2014un androide creado para proteger a los humanos durante expediciones\u2014 que ha hackeado su propio m\u00f3dulo de control para evitar convertirse en una m\u00e1quina de matar. En vez de obedecer sin cuestionar, dedica su tiempo libre a ver series. La historia se desarrolla en un lejano planeta, donde Matabot acompa\u00f1a a un grupo de cient\u00edficos. Su misi\u00f3n se complica cuando otro equipo desaparece, lo que obliga a Matabot y sus humanos a investigar el extra\u00f1o suceso por s\u00ed mismos. Pero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del misterio sobre el que gira la trama, el verdadero atractivo es el propio Matabot como narrador: su voz interior es sarc\u00e1stica, cargada de iron\u00eda, profundamente introvertida y con una ansiedad social que lo hace sorprendentemente humano y con el que es f\u00e1cil sentirse identificado. A pesar de su apariencia letal, Matabot se muestra con muchas inseguridades, dubitativo en su relaci\u00f3n con los humanos aunque haya devorado centenares de horas de telenovelas para aprender sus maneras de hacer las cosas. Esta contradicci\u00f3n entre su potencia f\u00edsica y su vulnerabilidad emocional convierte al personaje en algo m\u00e1s que un simple robot de acci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, el relato entra en temas m\u00e1s profundos como el libre albedr\u00edo o la identidad, sin perder un ritmo \u00e1gil ni su tono ir\u00f3nico. Siendo una novela corta que engancha sin necesidad de grandes giros de gui\u00f3n o escenas repletas de acci\u00f3n. Por lo que si te interesa una ciencia ficci\u00f3n ligera pero con peso emocional y un androide con crisis existenciales, \u201cTots els Sistemes en Vermell\u201d es una lectura muy recomendable. 12 likes"}

{"username":"Jeni","date":1763424000000,"review_text":"All Systems Red, the first novella in Wells\u2019 Murderbot Diaries, series tells the story about an AI unit assigned to a team of scientists who have traveled to a planet to test native elements. When another scientific party on the planet goes silent, the AI unit, which calls itself Murderbot, helps the original team investigate. Murderbot would really rather stream action adventures and isolate. However, the unit unwillingly becomes part of the team as they look into what\u2019s happening on the planet and attempt to survive unanticipated threats. This story, told from the Murderbot\u2019s perspective, makes one think about how humanity could be blindly adopting AI without regard to the possible feelings and emotions that \u201ccreated\u201d tech may eventually have. Hats off to Wells for exploring this topic in such a humorous, yet poignant manner. I can\u2019t wait to read the series\u2019 next novella, Artificial Condition."}

The story takes place on a distant planet where a small survey team studies the terrain under the supervision of a SecUnit\u2014Murderbot\u2014an android with hacked governance modules. This setup creates a world run by contracted corporations, where safety and information depend on whatever a company chooses to fund. The contrast between the human scientists and Murderbot\u2019s private, self-aware commentary gives the book its appeal. The premise is strong: an artificial construct trying to manage human responsibility while avoiding emotional involvement. The pacing is quick, and the action scenes keep the plot moving, but the novella doesn\u2019t explore the planet, the corporation, or Murderbot\u2019s inner conflict in much detail. The result is a light reading experience that hints at bigger ideas without spending much time on them. The novella introduced an interesting premise, but its short length keeps the characters, world, and themes at arm\u2019s length.

The non-human main character is a distant outsider but awkward and self-conscious rather than Spock-like, superior, or aloof. If that's all it was, the humor could get too cute or overbearing, but there's a good balance of the internal stuff and the suspense\/action, which reminds you that Murderbot is also a terrifying badass."}

This is another book I\u2019ve heard a lot about in the sci-fi community. It was even turned into a TV series on Amazon. The story follows a robot, or really a half robot and half human construct built to murder. Hence the title Murderbot Diaries. Admittedly, it was a rough start for me. I struggled to make sense of who the main character was. It is told in first person, and while it describes itself with robotic and android functions, it sounds incredibly human. Which is exactly the point. It is an easy short novella. On a distant planet, a group of scientists and their corporate supplied self aware android who calls itself Murderbot conduct tests on the planet\u2019s surface, which seems uninhabited by any sentient beings. But they aren\u2019t alone, and when their neighboring team goes dark, they set out to figure out what happened. However, at the heart of the story is the question of what it truly means to be human. Did NOT expect that ending, and it was perfect."}

A good portion of the page time was spent establishing our narrators personality, since its so lovable and funny that made this a fun read. But the story would have benefited from more length, the conflict \/ mystery was missing depth.

{"username":"Farah","date":1763164800000,"review_text":"Reminds me of all the parts I liked of Isaac Asimov\u2019s I, Robot. Love the premise of a bot with some apathy and ennui while being likeable. We only got snippets of some of the people that Murderbot interacted with but I found myself invested in them and interested in them navigating these newer interactions. I liked getting to mull over what makes one human with a new context to frame a question that comes up many times and in many forms! This was an easy read and I read straight through once I picked a time where I felt patient enough to get past the first few pages when I felt lost and not sure where we were headed. Sometimes all the computer and systems stuff felt confusing so I do wish the author had made certain things clearer so we could get more of the strategic moves\u2026 But I felt like I didn\u2019t need to think too much about all that and could just let it be without missing a whole lot. I\u2019m wondering if the series just has all new characters in the next part. I\u2019ll be a little sad to leave Mensah behind!"}

A quick read full of absolutely delightful commentary by the narrator. I am a sucker for alien\/android cultural clashes in my SciFi reads, and the narration by and interactions of Murderbot is perfectly up my alley in that way. The awkward, yet very intelligent, and not entirely apathetic personality of Murderbot was a refreshing change of pace from more self-aggrandizing heroic protagonists. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick, fun SciFi adventure, with the added benefit of more books in the series if they find themselves as charmed as I did."}

The series gave screen time to Sanctuary Moon, a show that Murderbot enjoys throughout the book series. It dropped a few characters, added a throple subplot , and gave the freedom of Murderbot way more suspense. It retained the spirit of the book and did well overall. Solid B rating. As for the book, compact and moves the action quickly. You learn to love Murderbot, a company SecUnit, and his band of weird science humans. Dr Mensah is a leader you want."}

This was my second read of Martha Wells All Systems Red, coming back to it after watching season one of the TV series, and I still loved it. The book holds up incredibly well on a reread, with Murderbot\u2019s dry, anxious, deeply relatable voice remaining the real highlight. If anything, knowing the story already let me enjoy the humour, pacing, and character work even more. A sharp, comforting sci-fi read that absolutely deserves its hype. 1 like"}

My eyeballs devoured this first novella, All Systems Red, which introduces us to a unique protagonist: the self-named \u201cMurderbot.\u201d This Security Unit (SecUnit) hacked its governor module not to start a murderous rampage (despite the name), but to gain the freedom to binge-watch its favorite serialized entertainment, Sanctuary Moon. Assigned to protect a planetary survey team, Murderbot is a masterclass in being thoroughly over it, preferring streaming to socializing. However, when their mission hits a snag involving sabotage and disappearing data the socially awkward robot is reluctantly forced to set aside the remote and use its security genius to protect its pesky humans, which delves some of the philosophical questions about choice. Without the governor module, why does the Murderbot choose to take care of its clients? The narrative is a nice blend of wry internal monologue and corporate conspiracy. For anyone who's ever used a media distraction to avoid people, this book is an easy five-star read and the perfect, concise setup for a great series. \u2013This review was partially drafted by A.I. (Gemini) with a fairly lengthy prompt containing my opinions and the notes I took while reading. Much of the review is rewording of the prompt I entered and my notes. \u2013"}

{"username":"Colleen","date":1762819200000,"review_text":"In my quest to expand my sci-fi reading list, I decided to try Martha Wells. She\u2019s highly rated and I had success with another female sci-fi author (Becky Chambers), so I was hoping to find another series that would suck me in. All Systems Red, the first of the Murderbot Diaries series, is a very quick read. It\u2019s a novella that can be read in under two hours. I was a tad worried when I started it because the reader is thrown into the story immediately, along with a lot of technical jargon, with no lead up. I thought that wasn\u2019t going to bode well for me, a very new sci-fi reader and someone who will pick a character-driven story over an adventure story every time. However, I needn\u2019t have worried. The quick dunk into Murderbot\u2019s world was necessary because there was a lot of action to cram into this novella... no time for world-building! If a sci-fi novice such as myself can figure out what\u2019s happening, then I think it\u2019s safe to say just about anyone can! I enjoyed the book and read it pretty much in one sitting. Although it had a lot more action than I usual like, it also took the time to let the reader get to know the characters (especially Murderbot and Dr. Mansah) and delve into some of the ethical dilemmas of creating a society that has humans, augmented humans, and artificial androids. The ending hit me a lot more emotionally than I would have suspected a story starring a security android would (although I should have learned my lesson with the novel Annie Bot). I liked the story and I actually liked Murderbot but, to be honest, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to continue with the series. The story felt complete to me, and I don\u2019t feel compelled to follow Murderbot\u2019s future adventures. I\u2019m not certain why. Maybe there\u2019s just too must \u201caction\u201d for me? I\u2019ll mull it over. I may try the second book in the series and see how I feel. If I decide not to, though, I\u2019m content with this novella standing as it is. novella science-fiction space"}

{"username":"Lydia Tena","date":1763510400000,"review_text":"I absolutely LOVED this book! Definitely not what I was expecting in the best way possible. The best way I can describe this book is to say that it is an adult version of the children\u2019s book The Wild Robot. I read the series with my little girl earlier this year and this reminded me SO much of that book. It\u2019s about a robot that has hacked its internal governor module system and so doesn\u2019t HAVE to obey the humans he is assigned to, but still chooses to anyway. He claims not to like the humans it works for and plans to kill them\u2026 eventually, but for now he will just watch the thousands of hours worth of the media he has pre downloaded \ud83d\ude09 That is\u2026 when he\u2019s not defending said humans from enemy groups, hostile fauna, and rouge SecUnits. \u201cI\u2019ve got four perfectly good humans here and I didn\u2019t want them to get killed by whatever took out DeltFall. It\u2019s not like I cared about them personally, but it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.\u201d \u201cMaybe these clients had been terrible and abusive, maybe they had deserved it. I didn\u2019t care. Nobody was touching my humans.\u201d The book is told in Murderbot\u2019s unique point of view and getting to see his unwanted thoughts and emotions grow for his humans is awesome. This was truly an enjoyable read! Also, a little something extra to entice you even more\u2026 this bot is not constructed using only mechanical parts like we are use to seeing in other robot books and movies. Murderbot (as he calls himself) is made using mechanical and ORGANIC material! And how that comes into play in the book is really cool! That and there are \u201caugmented humans!\u201d This Sci-fi made my inner nerd very happy\u2026 just sayin! 1 like"}

I liked reading about Murderbot and while I might continue the series in the future, I thought that this had a satisfying ending. I am curious if the characters in this book are going to appear in the next books or if each book is going to be a different short story from Murderbot\u2019s life. Recap if continue the series: Murderbot is supposed to be a SecUnit (robot with some human\/organic elements) completely controlled by the company through the HubSystem. However, it managed to hack the HubSystem and while it still follows orders of the people it\u2019s hired out to in order to maintain its secret, it prefers watching TV series and not interacting with people. It has started to like the group of scientists it\u2019s with now and it helps them survive while a third party is sending compromised SecUnits to kill the researchers on this planet. Eventually they manage to get out and the scientists (one of which is a political agent) buy Murderbot\u2019s contract so it can live freely on their planet, but it doesn\u2019t believe them and the book ends with Murderbot sneaking out and travelling away from everyone.

Even though the story was different, it did make me think about Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It pulled off what All Systems Red tried to with it's humor. Besides the humor, it didn't help that it just dropped you in the middle somewhere and seemingly seemed to end somewhere too. It gave me the feeling I was reading a couple of chapters within a larger story, without having read those. As I said, the book isn't bad, it just didn't do anything special and felt really ordinary.

Well, Martha Wells tells you that succinct tale perfectly.

First chapter got me interested - an interesting planet, an interesting concept- bot who has free will of sort (by bypassing the governor module). But that was the best of it, it didn't lead to anywhere. The main plot - with regards to the planet survey happening is forgettable one and we don't get much insights in the backstory or the world either. I can appreciate points raised about it being bot growing free will but not necessary following the human template when it comes to it. I also like the murderbot just wanting to be left alone and just watch 'Sanctuary Moon'. I really appreciate the show of empathy as well. But overall the book was an average experience for me. Maybe I was expecting too much in the worldbuilding department. Even if I consider it to be carrying some other message, relatable things - I would rather read it in contemporary setting as the sci fi setting doesn't add much here. audiobook sci-fi 1 like"}

But when another survey team runs into trouble, Murderbot (as the droid privately refers to itself) is forced to interact with its humans to find out what happened. Along the way, it finds itself - - horrors! -- actually starting to like humans \u2014 at least these particular humans. The narrative is a little skimpy on world-building. We get just enough details to know that the story is set in a space-exploring future that is dominated by various corporations, some of them unethical in their methods. But that doesn\u2019t really matter, because the focus of the story isn\u2019t the setting but the charmingly snarky main character, who is still trying to decide who it is and what its purpose in the universe should be.

{"username":"Lori","date":1762560000000,"review_text":"Let me first say, Murderbot is not half human, half robot as some reviews state. It is all robot made with some organic parts in order to appear and function (in a kinesthetic way) as human. And that was my big hang up: how does an AI entity become sentient? Because Murderbot is that. Perhaps this evolution is explained later in the series. I'll have to read more to find out. However, I was enamored of Murderbot. It was a bit like a teen cloaked in ennui with a sash of disdain who is forced to move outside of its own self-absorption in order to help save its world (in this case, save the humans it is charged with protecting). But I find Murderbot charming. I also find interesting the parallels to robot ownership and human slavery, as explored in this story. I hope that is a running theme as I'd like to see where Ms. Wells takes that. I didn't read this as comedic. I note it now is a streaming series labeled as comedy. I can maybe see that.

I haven\u2019t read a good sci-fi in a long time, months I think, so this was refreshing. I really enjoyed the main character (more details on him below) and even the side characters! I won\u2019t go into detail about the side characters in this review because I don\u2019t know how to spell (or say) their names but they were all very well done! I liked the different relationships between them all (including our MC) and they reacted to and treated Murderbot like actual humans would\u2019ve throughout the book. There was a good amount of action in the tiny book and I never got bored.

{"username":"Tucker","date":1762473600000,"review_text":"I like mediocre sci-fi better than most other genres, but I really love great sci-fi and this entire series is absolutely great. Wells' writing manages that elusive balance of being funny and at the same time intriguing and thought-provoking. All Systems Red is tight, clever, and emotionally resonant, with Murderbot\u2019s dry sarcasm masking real depth. The worldbuilding is efficient, the pacing sharp, and the character voice unforgettable. It\u2019s rare to find a sci-fi novella that\u2019s this entertaining while still saying something meaningful. A fantastic start to a series that only gets better. For those familiar with the TV Series I'll add that as usual the book is way better. The books dive so much deeper into the character's internal motivations and conflicts. The TV Series seems to have hope, though and I think Skarsg\u00e5rd gives Murderbot the right voice, the show just needs a little better writing and longer story arcs."}

{"username":"lyny","date":1762387200000,"review_text":"Well written AI influenced sci fi. (My score reflects that I am not a great fan of sci fi, but it has won many awards when originally published in 2017, and I can see why - it is an enjoyable set up and set of characters, and with a relatively simple plot). The story is told by the Murderbot, who is a constructed AI robot with some organic (human-style) bits and is owned by a company that leases it out to provide security for companies (in this case exploring new planets for valuable minerals). The bot gets direct downloads of various kinds, and is equipped with weapons. Murderbots are much harder to kill than humans (for one thing they are encased in armour), and most parts of them can be replaced by the company \u2013 or if things go wrong they can be scrapped. This Murderbot is uncomfortable about interaction with humans, but is skilled at interpreting their emotions and actions. It prefers to have time in a separate part of the space unit, and when in human company to keep its face shield opaque (though the head part is installed to not frighten them being a \u2018standard, generic human\u2019 head p15). However it has a form of intelligence that has allowed it to subvert some of the things built into the AI by the company. In particular it has dismantled the governor unit that allows it to be directly controlled by the company, but also has done that in a way where their own systems will not pick it up. So in that sense it has agency \u2013 freedom to act by its own control. It also seems to experience interests and boredom, and specializes in downloading entertainment soapie type programs and spending a lot of time watching them, and on the other hand, ignoring downloads and security updates and only taking up what it sees as relevant. Many reviewers have commented positively on the engaging character and voice of this Murderbot \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a sex, but I can imagine it being played by a lugubrious older British actor. The set up emphasizes a number of things about the context \u2013 in particular the ongoing profit motive driving things, and the way in which the company does things in the cheapest way that seems viable, so things can go wrong because of the \u2018crap\u2019 materials. It also sets out three categories of beings in a class type of hierarchy: humans, cyber enhanced humans, and murderbots. It is common for the murderbots to be seen and treated as robots, but in this story the team, especially the leader Mensah, begin to see the bot as having an identity, and caring for it. Similarly, the bot begins to act to save and \u2018care for\u2019 the humans, beyond what has been apparently built in. The central plot is about some of the info systems and energy beginning to not be available, and the bot and crew suspecting the crew of the unit they were about to hook up with and reload from has been attacked and killed. They do find most of the crew dead, with some robots having apparently gone rogue (actually reprogrammed by some others I think), and Murderbot and the human crew perform various actions to save each other at different points. As a result when they get back to the company control, Mensah arranges to permanently buy the Murderbot so they can \u2018adopt it\u2019. In this context this is seen somewhat like buying and liberating a slave. But Murderbot doesn\u2019t want to exchange one type of surveillance and control for another (albeit one partly based on empathy and care) and the story finishes with it managing to disable ways it can be traced and hitch-hiking a ride somewhere else where no-one knows of its existence."}

I know that this is a first book and the later books will probably explore more of Murderbot as a character and their backstory but I wish that the first book had a little bit more of that instead of the murder mystery.

I'm hoping the next books have something more exciting or new to live up to the hype. 1 like"}

Free was a great companion to this book and it was done really well. I liked that it did not get bogged down in the details regarding how their space travel worked and focused more on what was happening in the story. One thing that I feel could be better regarding this story revolves around the fact that Murderbot felt more human than the augmented humans in the story. Of course, we get some emotional depth with Mensah and some others, but I feel the perspective locked in first-person led to the feeling that Murderbot might as well be a full human. I can understand that this might be intentional, but I think the other characters fell mostly flat and I could have seen more work with the others. This is a reread, and I read this first a few years ago, along with most of the others in the series, and I feel this is improved as it goes, but this installment felt like it kept most of the primary characters at arms length. However, overall, this was an enoyable read and I like the worldbuilding that is put in place so far. I will be continuing with a reread of the others and will see where this goes. book-club"}

If this is the future of AI, humans will be lucky. Murderbot (as it calls itself) responds well to good treatment and does much more than it thought it should by actively engaging to save its humans. The best parts of this novella is the running commentary of Murderbot, who evolves and aims for better while shrinking away from too much interaction. The group of scientists are also funny in their own way and Murderbot puts their exceptional leader on a pedestal, which she deserves. All hail Murderbot!"}

{"username":"Michael","date":1762300800000,"review_text":"Witty, playful, fast-paced, and accessible, Martha Wells' All Systems Red drops the reader into the pov of a self-described Murderbot -- a science-fictional amalgam of cloned biological human biology fused with technology and software. Before the action breaks, our Murderbot has already unlugged him\/it\/herself from his governor module -- going rogue leading not to genocidal rampage but rather binge-watching entertainment serials from the future net and ponderously aiming for anonymity shying away from his human crew. Assigned as a security detail with a group of planetary surveyors prior to terraforming claims, the plot quickly reveals our Murderbot to exhibit an endearing pluck and self-deprecating humanity. This novella is swift-moving, pulpy, and taut. It does not overreach nor does it underdeliver. The language and sentence balance is refreshingly competent and entertaining, as is the manner of revealing aspects of the universe, politics, and characters. Martha Wells is a talented, productive, and effective writer based on this book. If there is one drawback, it is that the diverse crew of this mission are so sparsely identified in the early going that it is a bit overwhelming. Had I tried to differentiate all the different names, it would have slowed me down. Instinctively, I just accepted them as gray noise and let the names reveal the relevant aspects of personality as the plot progressed. This is not a character piece, nor is it devoid of character. There is heart here. Thanks to my friend Alexandra for recommending this book, the first in a series. The cover of my library copy credits the book as a Hugo and Nebula Award winner, and I can see why. The accolades are deserved."}

I think the author did a great job writing its thoughts and feelings in a way that's not quite human, not entirely machine, and not \"part human, part machine\" either, but a homogeneous blend of both. I also liked some of the human characters that murderbot was protecting, so I hope to see them again in the other books. Only a few of the humans got enough screen time for the reader to get to know them a little, but those few were interesting enough that I'd like to get to know them better. And we learned just enough about the setting to feel like it's a fully formed universe, but it's mostly in the background so it didn't distract from the story.

{"username":"Montrose Fell","date":1762300800000,"review_text":"Quick and fun read that covered my ground for 2 book clubs! I feel this is a better sci fi book than it is an ace book. Although the main character struggles with being incorrectly perceived as a sex bot, it ultimately is in a fundamentally different category of nonsexual beings, which I would say is pretty dissimilar from asexual humans who share the same physical form as allosexual humans. The story was interesting and made good use of the novella form. There was a clear plotline and the characters were developed well. I expected the ending to go in a different direction but I think as-is there are a lot of reasons for me to keep reading the series. ace-books lost-city-spec-fic"}

{"username":"John","date":1762214400000,"review_text":"So this was the first book I've ever read by this author. I started reading this at the recommendation of my daughter who knows I like a good science fiction story. This is so far, a really good series. I like that this book was relatively short which I really liked. However having said that, this book is well written and as such, the author packs a lot of information and story into this first book. I was surprised there was so little back story on the team of scientists yet I had to remind myself that the story is being told from the perspective of the main character, the murder bot. The story does conclude at the the end of the book yet leaves just enough cliff hanger to inspire you to keep reading onto the next book. After reading Stephen King for so long, this was a refreshing book. She didn't feel the need to bog the story down with unnecessary details and kept the story moving forward at all times. I am looking forward to continue reading the next book as this will be an easy totally enjoyable read. I would recommend this book and series to anyone who likes science fiction pertaining to the future. This story does not take place on Earth or even this galaxy which makes it easy to just get into the book. I'm currently reading the second book of the series, Artificial Condition. These books are all fairly short so finishing a book is not a long daunting task to get to the end yet each book is full of actual story."}

Martha Wells puts on a master class on how to properly write one. All Systems Red was delightful. The plot and character arcs were clear, the protagonist was relatable and there were plenty of funny moments to offset the high stakes in this science fiction story. Really glad this was recommended to me. I look forward to reading more from the series. 2025 5 likes"}

{"username":"Stephen","date":1762387200000,"review_text":"All Systems Red is a fun action-mystery thriller in a SF context. Our narrator, as the series title \u201cMurderbot Diaries\u201d might suggest, is not quite human. Murderbot is instead a robotic-organic construct that prefers humans see it, or him, as a robot: that way he\u2019s left alone to watch recorded TV dramas in his head when not monitoring feeds and shooting bogies as need shooting. Unlike most constructs, though, Murderbot is rogue: at some point he hacked his \u201cgovernor module\u201d, the bit that forces him to respond to orders, and has been keeping this secret to avoid being disassembled for parts, or worse \u2013 \u201cfixed\u201d. Murderbot as he styles himself, is a security unit: his whole function is to crush, kill, and demolish. We find out through the text that Murderbot hacked himself not to give him leeway to get rowdy, but because sometimes conflicting orders diminished his ability to function. Although I enjoyed the story, Murderbot didn\u2019t seem like an \u2018other\u2019 \u2013 unlike Shelli or Seven of Nine, whose cognition and verbal expression hint at their being different, and to a lesser degree R. Daneel Olivaw. (I say lesser because Olivaw was literally trying to pass as human for most of his lifespan and did fairly well at it.) I could see continuing in this series, as it made for fun reading. science-fiction 1 like"}

{"username":"Lisa M.","date":1762214400000,"review_text":"Murderbot just wants to watch it's shows!!! But god, this was so good. Even from one of the very first lines of the book, Murderbot says something like \"I did not care because I was not programmed to care about that.\" And that's such a brilliant and deliberate choice of words. It didn't say \"I was not programmed to be responsible for that\" or \"I was not programmed to be invested in that\" or anything of the like. It said \"I was not programmed to care.\" And that in and of itself just makes you think so much about the nature of sentience. \"Caring\" is something innate, and internal. Caring implies a personal attachment to something. And whether Murderbot was programmed to do so or not, saying that means that is does have the capacity to care, one way or another. 2025 2025-pick-your-poison 1 like"}

{"username":"Mason","date":1763942400000,"review_text":"All Systems Red thrives on one of the most unexpectedly human protagonists in modern sci-fi. Murderbot may be a construct with lethal capabilities, but its crippling social anxiety, dry humor, and relentless introspection make it one of the most relatable narrative voices I\u2019ve encountered. It\u2019s a mirror held up to the messier corners of the human mind \u2014 filtered through sarcasm, exhaustion, and an earnest desire to be left alone with its media. If anything, I found myself wishing for a bit more depth from this opening novella; it hints at greater emotional and thematic complexity without fully diving in. But as a starting point, it\u2019s funny, empathetic, and remarkably engaging. I\u2019m already looking forward to the future installments \u2014 this series clearly has a lot more to say."}

It reads more like a long short story than a novel, but that worked as an entry point into the world. Murderbot's dry humor landed well, and the story stayed tight and compact throughout. I can see why this gets so much love, though I went in expecting maybe a bit more given the enthusiasm around it. But it's also clearly just the beginning - more of a promising setup than a complete statement. Didn't blow me away yet, but it did exactly what a first entry should do: made me want to see where else this goes. series"}

I didn't feel like I had the emotional connection to any of the characters that I should have, and the plot was pretty basic sci-fi in my opinion. 1 like"}

{"username":"melhara","date":1761782400000,"review_text":"I immediately added this novella to my TBR after watching the Murderbot trailer, which looks amazing: Murderbot (that's its self-appointed name), is a security droid tasked with protecting a team of scientists while they conduct research on a planet. What the scientists don't know (yet), is that Murderbot had hacked its own system and is currently operating as a free agent while continuing with doing its job and saving its human companions (while binge watching its favorite shows, because what else is it supposed to do with its free time?) Murderbot is great at its job, but doesn't know how to interact with humans (nor does it enjoy it). It's social awkwardness is relatable (I too, prefer humans from TV shows than those from real life) which makes it a very likeable character. This is a really fun novella and entertaining audiobook to listen to.

{"username":"Tenome","date":1761609600000,"review_text":"\"All Systems Meh.\" The plot is paper thin and feels like an afterthought, and our titular Murderbot doesn't actually do any murdering. He doesn't have any goals or motivation, either, and basically just hangs around babysitting some humans until the novella decides it's time to be over. I don't see any reason to read more of this. It seems like it'll be an episodic series, but the one episode I've read thus far was really boring. For something that was hyped to comedic levels, this is disappointing. This boring novella won the Hugo and the Nebula, but I guess that just goes to show how worthless those awards are nowadays.

The found family is going to be great the major problem is that it\u2019s just too short. It\u2019s not long enough to get a good depth to the character and form a bond with them that makes me want to continue the series. Update after reading the second. The second book adds so much more depth to the character through exploring his back story of why he\u2019s gone rogue.

So if you like that game I think you would love this book. This book follows a rogue 'murderbot' acting as a security bot during a planetary survey mission that goes wrong. It's a very fun, engaging, read that will keep you gripped from start to finish.

The vibes in the setting and Murderbot's cavalier attitude were thoroughly entertaining, but I found myself wanting more character depth.

{"username":"Siddharth","date":1761350400000,"review_text":"The Story is straightforward, easy to grasp. It is a low SCI-FI thriller\/mystery packed with Humour, Action and a bit of self discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.\u201d He shook his head, dismissing it. \u201cIt\u2019s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can\u2019t be watching it, not in that volume; we\u2019d notice.\u201d I snorted. He underestimated me. It is no wonder that the book got made into a tv-series, because it was made for exactly this. It is short (144 pages) and it reads exactly like an episode from a multipart drama series. A single mystery per book in the series. Prose is simple, and as much I hate to say it, you can read it with your brain on a vacation (Does not mean that it is bad, just that it is relatively simple read) Good world building (from what you can accomplish in 140 pages) and characters. Felt like an episode of Crime scene investigation. 4\/5 for me, I had fun reading it."}

{"username":"Dr. Beanbrain","date":1761350400000,"review_text":"I loved this book! And I absolutely loved Murderbot! But I did not love the swearing, nor the homosexuality and polyamory. The homo and poly stuff was not super prevalent, but the swearing was consistent throughout the book. Those are my complaints with this novella. It's so rare to find books centered around robot characters (Murderbot may not exactly fall within the robot category, but it's close enough), and as someone who loves robots, it's honestly a bummer. It would be awesome to see more books feature robots as main characters \u2014 and not just side characters. But, for now, Murderbot will more than do. :)"}

This is a really good book and looks to start an excellent series. It is more a novella in length and content, but serves as an introduction to Murderbot and shows the sorts of interactions and intentions that will inform the character in later books. I enjoyed the read quite a bit. The pacing was good, but not great; some areas dragged a bit but not because the reader needed a break or that a slower pace added to the plot. The character is meant to be ambiguous (I hope) and that came through quite well. The supporting characters were fleshed out well enough, as to be expected in a novella (not enough pages to get more depth). The setting was simple and the plot moved along a pretty obvious path. owned 16 likes"}

All Systems Red is short, fun and genuinely interesting! It's packed with subtle witty remarks that kept me entertained throughout. What caught me off guard was how eerily relatable Murderbot is. A bot with an addiction to entertainment and crippling social anxiety, that sounds like someone I know very well (yes, it's me). There's something both hilarious and oddly touching about seeing your own tendencies reflected in a security robot. I don't have much else to say except this: just read it. You'll find it really engaging even if, like me, you're not normally a sci-fi fan. The ending leaves so many exciting possibilities for future books in the series and I definitely want to continue following Murderbot's journey.

The fact that it hacked its own HubSystem and governor module just to binge-watch entertainment feeds is both ridiculous and hilarious. Murderbot is such a brilliantly messed-up, self-aware robot. Despite not liking humans, doing its job half-heartedly, and generally not caring about much, including who it was protecting or where it were, it somehow ended up caring for its humans in the end.

It\u2019s the first of the Murderbot books, and the protagonist is a robot with some human parts, currently working for a group of scientists who are surveying a planet. Murderbot is a great character, a little sarcastic, quite rebellious, fiercely loyal to the people they like. They aren\u2019t too interested in what the scientists are doing, and they spend their off hours watching soap operas and other entertainment media. They actually learn important things from all this pop culture. In this short book, the bad guys are trying to keep the surveyors from discovering archeological remains (since those would keep the planet free from exploitation). There\u2019s a lot of tech detail about comm units and hub feeds and drone data, but it doesn\u2019t take too long to get the gist of it.

{"username":"Ken Man","date":1761696000000,"review_text":"3\/5, an okay novella if you have a few hours to spare. The world setting is interesting, with some dark elements that were not expanded further. My biggest reason why I rate it as a 3\/5 but not higher is that I don\u2019t like the murderbot character as the main character too much. It is because there are practically very few motivations for its actions. It is a relatable character, and I like that about it. But it doesn\u2019t have much skin (skin suit?) in the game, and it makes it quite difficult for me to root for it. It did not grow in its own character and what it wants, which makes the read feel a lot more like a ride with the group rather than witnessing them experience a life-or-death situation. I like that it is making small decisions like taking the helmet off as it starts to warm up to the group. It fits the role of a spiritual animal for the ride, but I want someone with a slightly stronger motive to keep the pace of the story rather than the EvilSurvey pushing the pace."}

{"username":"Kyla","date":1763337600000,"review_text":"This is an entertaining series that I do enjoy reading. My main complaint about this book is the same one I have about the entire series: the writing style. The narration at times sounds like your kid sister telling you about her day at school. \"And then we did this because of that. and then she said that to him, and then he said that to her. then we had lunch, and it was this, and I liked it, but she didn't because...\" There are stretches of the book that read like a list of facts rather than a story. So much of this book is MurderBot saying \"I did this with the hub because of that. Then I did that because SecSystem works like this. Then she did that because she thought the hopper was like this, but really it was like that.\" Maybe the idea was to get into the mind of MurderBot, so that the narration sounds just as droll as his internal monologue? But from my POV, I just wanted more storytelling and less...lists."}

{"username":"Neha","date":1760745600000,"review_text":"The premise is super interesting and definitely leans into a strong sci-fi angle. But I had mixed feelings overall. The plot was intriguing, but the book was so short that just when you're getting into it, it's already done. It almost felt like a rough outline or script for a TV show, or a set of notes building toward a larger story. For sci-fi, I expected more depth\u2014more descriptions of the tech, the planets, the people (or bots). Maybe the sparse details were intentional since it\u2019s written as a robot\u2019s diary, but it left me wanting more. The action scenes were quite underwhelming too. That said, I did finish it\u2014so there was enough to keep me curious."}
{"username":"Tina Huynh","date":1760918400000,"review_text":"I\u2019m usually drawn to short reads, so the Murderbot Diaries immediately caught my attention. The premise is fascinating - a SecUnit that secretly hacks its own governor module and gains autonomy. Instead of going rogue in the dramatic sci-fi way I expected, it mostly just wants to be left alone to watch its favorite serials. Relatable! What surprised me most was how human this part-machine protagonist felt. Murderbot experiences everything from social anxiety to reluctant compassion, which was both endearing and oddly comforting to read about. I didn\u2019t expect to connect emotionally with a robot, yet here we are. While I enjoyed the concept and voice of the narrator, I found myself zoning out at times and having to rewind or reread passages. I think this is one of those stories that works better when read on the page rather than listened to as an audiobook - maybe I\u2019m just not the best at auditory focus, but I struggled to stay engaged. I\u2019m curious to learn more about the planet they were surveying and why the mission mattered so much. The world-building intrigued me, but I wish it had gone a little deeper. Overall, All Systems Red is an interesting and clever start to a series with a unique protagonist. I didn\u2019t love it enough to give it a full 5 stars, but it definitely piqued my interest. I\u2019d rate it a 3 and 4. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m willing to continue this series. sci-fi"}

The characterizations were on-point, the way the world was described, both physically and emotionally felt right for the POV, and the stakes\/problem were interesting enough to keep the story moving. I liked the ending too, it was satisfying, but opens the story up to continuation. It is not a happily ever after neat and tidy ending, but it fits with the character and style of the story.

The reader is given insight to the inner thoughts and impulses of our robotic main character which adds comedy, or dark humor at least! It becomes almost a coming of age book as the robot (reprogrammed from earlier deployments) experiences the worlds he (it) is tasked to. Interestingly we find even robots are prejudiced, though their biase is towards other robots or programs and the tasks these other systems are burdened with. I enjoyed this as an audiobook and note that not all good books work well as audiobooks but this one does!! It\u2019s a quick read and interesting through and through!"}

{"username":"Jaxx Taylor","date":1760486400000,"review_text":"Murderbot is a SecUnit who has hacked its own system and now doesn't innately follow the orders and rules set to it by its programming. It also watches a LOT of bad TV shows. We meet Murderbot working for Dr Mensah's team on a planet which is being identified for use as a resource mine, and then things go wrong for a secondary team on the same planet. Murderbot is so sarcastic and apathetic, it really couldn't care less about most things and I think that's why I fogged up a bit when I saw it talking about Dr Mensah's team as \"my humans\". While it doesn't really care about its job as long as it gets downtime to watch shows, and it kind of skips a lot of the boring paperwork tasks it should be completing, Murderbot does come to care about its charges and their wellbeing. I loved this little robot, for me there wasn't enough story here, I wanted more but I suspect that this was a handshake at the beginning of the whole thing, it was a gentle introduction and I will be reading on to find out what is next in store for the cynical, pessimistic, funny Murderbot."}

{"username":"Rhea","date":1761091200000,"review_text":"Performance reliability at 100% and increasing OMG, I'm in love with Murderbot. I'm kidding, I'm kidding\u2026or am I? Yes, I will talk about Murderbot as he\/him. To me, Murderbot is a He. Now, with this obvious infuriating and offending personal preference out of some people\u2019s way, let\u2019s dive in. SPOILERS ahead. Believe me when I tell you that you\u2019ll find it simply impossible not to love this self-aware SecUnit that hacked into his own governor module and is anxious around humans and doesn't like showing his face. How can you not like the funny, sarcastic bot thinking he's a complete failure at his murdering job and would rather watch tv shows? Murderbot might feel like an unreliable narrator because it\u2019s very obvious he\u2019s struggling with his identity and feelings and confusion about what it means to be alive and free, but his tone is absolutely a blast. He\u2019s sarcastic, awkward, anxious, uncomfortable around humans, he hates them but also cares for them, he doesn\u2019t like showing his face, but also does it when requested by a certain someone, even though he was not forced to do it (he was a Free Agent, no longer a slave of his programming). But she had barely looked at me and I had barely looked at her because again, murderbot + actual human = awkwardness. I put the pilot\u2019s console on standby, and looked at Mensah. She pressed her lips together, like she wanted to say something and was repressing the urge. Then she nodded firmly and said, \u201cGood luck.\u201d I felt like I should say something to her, and didn\u2019t know what, and just stared at her awkwardly for a few seconds. Then I sealed up my helmet and got out of the hopper as fast as I could. Mensah sent me a private message through the feed: I hope you\u2019re all right. Because you need me. I don\u2019t know where that came from. Alright, it came from me, but she was my client, I was a SecUnit. There was no emotional contract between us. There was no rational reason for me to sound like a whiny human baby. This shows perfectly how confused he was by his own thoughts and desires, his feelings often betraying an underlying need for connection even when he claims he despises it, even when he doesn\u2019t know how to feel about his own thoughts. I mean, how adorable is that? No? Too emotional and lovey-dovey? How about this? \"So you don\u2019t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\u201d \u201cProbably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms. \u201cThere\u2019s another question I\u2019d like the answer to.\u201d Gurathin looked at me expectantly. She isn\u2019t talking about me, idiot. Gurathin hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.\u201d[\u2026] \u201cIt\u2019s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can\u2019t be watching it, not in that volume; we\u2019d notice.\u201d I snorted. He underestimated me. Ratthi said, \u201cThe one where the colony\u2019s solicitor killed the terraforming supervisor who was the secondary donor for her implanted baby?\u201d Again, I couldn\u2019t help it. I said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t kill him, that\u2019s a fucking lie.\u201d Ratthi turned to Mensah. \u201cIt\u2019s watching it.\u201d \u201cIt calls itself \u2018Murderbot\u2019 , Gurathin said. From their expressions I knew everything I felt was showing on my face, and I hate that. I grated out, \u201cThat was private.\u201d What I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn\u2019t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look at me. I\u2019m not a sexbot.\u201d This is the other side of him, the part that makes us laugh. But even in this sort of aggression and displeasure of interacting with humans, it\u2019s so obvious that he does this because some other part of him is fighting back. It\u2019s a paradox within him that he struggles with to reconcile. So to Murderbot the human interactions felt like he was seen as a thing to be used for their own gratification. He lives in a world where constructs like him, half robot half human parts, are treated and used as slaves. They were lucky if they were bought by a decent human being to free their contract. As he states, most of those bots fall in love with their guardians, albeit in secret. When DeltFall, a sister habitat on the other side of the planet Murderbot is currently operating on with his crew, is going silent, they set on a mission to find out what's going on with that base. Upon entering the base, he finds out the humans were indeed dead and the SecUnits in there went rogue. He tried to kill them but got captured and they implanted a combat module in the socket behind his head to turn him against his own crew. When he is saved by Dr. Mensah, and brought back to their hopper, they try to save him, but he demands to be put down and when his request is denied, he shoots himself to spare the humans from being hurt by him. Needless to say he was brought back by the crew but they also found out that Murderbot was a free agent all along. Now they suspect him for tampering with their wrong maps and the whole messed up mission. However, several crew members vouch for Murderbot for not, well, murdering them. Eventually they find out who killed the DeltFall people and they try to escape from the planet, fortunately succeeding in their attempt. I couldn't help myself but Mensah and Murderbot were just so cute working together and interacting. It was obvious he felt more comfortable around her as opposed to how he felt towards other humans. She respects him, she understands his struggles. Maybe it's the romantic in me, but I felt like there was a deeper connection between them. The private talks between them are so powerful, so intimate and precious I just melted. Personally, I found it so sweet how Murderbot listens to Mensah's request of removing his helmet and showing his face to the rest of the crew. I\u2019m fairly certain after I noticed many interactions between them, that he cares a lot about her, calling her his \u2018favorite human\u2019. \u201cI know you\u2019re more comfortable with keeping your helmet opaque, but the situation has changed. We need to see you.\u201d [...] \u201cIt\u2019s usually better if humans think of me as a robot.\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe, under normal circumstances.\u201d [...] But this situation is different. It would be better if they could think of you as a person who is trying to help. Because that\u2019s how I think of you..\u201d My insides melted. That\u2019s the only way I could describe it. The relationship between Mensah and Murderbot starts like a strong friendship, though sometimes it might feel romantic to some of us ( maybe because we operate on different parameters). Though he specified that he doesn\u2019t have a gender nor the sex parts for any gender, I\u2019ll argue till our sun fails to rise that a romantic relationship is not strictly related to your gender or what\u2019s down below the waist (robot, human, or alien). So, in that regard, I don\u2019t agree with others who vehemently state that there could be no romantic relationship developing between them because of the aforementioned reason. This first part concludes with Mensah buying Murderbot\u2019s contract and becoming his Guardian or in other words, his owner. As already mentioned, constructs like him are used by people or companies for different jobs, but can be bought and then they would have a guardian. But the ending is actually bittersweet and he actually runs away, refusing to go with Mensah, not because he doesn't want to live with her, but because he doesn't want to be told what to want and who he is. He wants to find out who he truly is and to be free, which I can totally understand considering beings like him were slaves. So excited to jump right into the next volumes. artificial_intelligence horror_scifi_favorites robots ...more 60 likes"}

Would rather watch shows but ends up reluctantly, snarkily saving humans when they get themselves in trouble. A fun listen with lots of one-liners and great moments. The sci-fi world we're in (with space stations, ships, bots, and interplanetary corporate corruption) as well as the neural networks (and 'feeds') everyone uses to communicate were cleverly integrated into the story in a way that makes sense without info dumping. Murderbot is technically genderless (has no genitals nor thinks of itself as one or the other) but if you listen to the audio or watch the show, you'll probably picture it as male. Either way, Murderbot is super relatable, hilarious, and, surprise, goes through character development! Highly recommended. (And props to the TV series for creating scenes from \"Sanctuary Moon\", Murderbot's favorite show.)"}

Ms. Wells has hit gold as the 'Murderbot Diaries' (five so far?) which has been adapted into a very funny Apple + series. The books are a little more technical but it is clear that the shy 'construct'*, Murderbot, a blend of organic material and machine, was born in her writing. The TV show is very well cast with Alex Skaragard killing it as Murderbot. In the book and the show, Murderbot, the 'construct', is employed as a Sec Unit (security unit) to guarantee the safety of a team of explorers looking for value in an unexplored planet. Throughout Ms. Wells harpoons modern everything- corporate structure, mass media, capitalism, romance; her broad brush reminded me of Doug Adams and the Hitchhiker books. Light, fun, short. Looking forward to book 2. *I imagine the term cyborg is not used in order to shed all pre-conceived notions and the history of famous cyborgs (Terminator etc.) sci-fi"}

All Systems Red was even better than most of those stories, though, due to its strong dose of humor. I had plenty of laughs while reading this book, mostly because the main character, a robot, would rather be bingeing videos than helping the annoying humans that it had been assigned to protect. The humor in the book is balanced with a good, fast-paced plot about a threat to a group on an exploratory expedition on a newly discovered planet.

Hacking into their governor module to download thousands upon thousands of hours of tv shows and movies to watch instead of talk to humans? 11\/10. Murderbot gets us and we all get Murderbot.

{"username":"Morgan Barnard","date":1761264000000,"review_text":"I think the most embarrassing part of reading this book over the course of two months is that it's only 150 pages. I read about 75% of this in one evening; it just hit me at a busy time of year. I enjoyed this! The perspective of the sarcastic sentient robot-clone thing that is also a \"murderbot\" was really cool. Particularly the part where they just don't give a f--- and just want to go watch their shows. This was a cool little spacey story. I don't know if I will ever get to the other murderbot diaries, but who knows? This was fun and entertaining, and as much as I liked the crew, I did like that the murderbot took off on their own adventure at the end."}

The prose was easy to digest, humorous at times, and I really liked the occasional fourth wall break. That said the writing does leave a lot to be desired for description. You\u2019re told what things are and who people are but not what they look like. Also none of the human characters feel unique from one another. I think this is the major flaw of the story. The PreservationAux surbey team should have been smaller so we could get some better characterization. Overall an enjoyable read and I actually like the shorter length. Also, love the poly rep, wasn\u2019t expecting that even if it was just a couple off-hand comments. Anyways, I\u2019ll definitely be continuing in the series to see where SecUnit ends up."}

{"username":"Patrick Johnson","date":1759881600000,"review_text":"Fun, quick little novella from the perspective of a security robot tasked with defending a group of researchers on an unknown planet. Murderbot (yes, that\u2019s his name) is hilariously awkward, loathes interacting with humans, and would much rather watch tv shows all day. Relatable. Watching him try to navigate his emotions towards the humans is quite cute. It\u2019s like he truly wants to protect them but just can\u2019t understand why. The writing is simplistic but does a good job capturing the no-frills, deadpan voice of a robot with a little attitude. Very little is explained about the world, but I imagine that is intentional because why would a robot give a shit about anything other than his objective (and his tv shows). Lots of funny quips.

But that is not to say that I completely lose my critical faculties, or that this book doesn't deserve the 5 stars, because I'm very sure it does. And reviews are allowed, even supposed to be subjective after all. It's funny, but very touching, and though I of course want to complain about how short it was, that's just me, and I don't think that being longer would have benefited it in any way. In fact it would have harmed. I loved Murderbot so much, the shy and self-conscious robot was everything to me. At first I wished for the humans to be a little more easily distinguishable from one another, but when I realised this wasn't about them I was perfectly happy following just Murderbot. At first I thought the descriptions were a bit lacking, but with the fact it was my beloved Murderbot narrating, I got over that pretty quickly as well. And then in the last couple pages Wells totally broke my heart, but it's ok because she earned it."}

It's a nice, quick read, with its own voice and an interesting and kinda funny premise, but I couldn't help but feel like there could be done much more with it. Apart from the so called Murderbot, I can't say I remember any of the other characters. And the action, I found it kinda repetitve, blasters going off and murderbots blowing up. Now for the story, it is quick action-y mission of our robotic 'hero' with its ups and downs, that is servicable, even though the final segment is kind of underwhelming and abrupt. And not to be a negative Nancy, let's talk about the good stuff. The Murderbot. I really like this character and want to see more of him (of it?). He (it?) is the only reason I want to and will read the next books, that's how much of a pull he has. The ending promises great things with this character and I will oblige. Another good thing is the prose. It is exactly what a sci-fi book needs. Not too difficult scientific mumbo-jumbo that'll get you lost, but the more-is-less approach that doesn't exclude any reader. So, yeah, it's a recommend for sci-fi fans and maybe non-sci-fi fans, being this short and not time consuming. 1 like"}

As much as I enjoy Murderbot the character, I was less enthused about Murderbot the story. This feels extremely episodic, which makes sense, since I believe it is a television show now. The story was largely a generic science fiction affair, over right when it felt like it might tread new territory.

{"username":"Saige","date":1759536000000,"review_text":"Oh my GOD woman-written sci-fi just hits different. I've been so deep in the Asimov sauce that I lowkey forgot how good it can feel to read a text that has basic respect for women and gives proper accolades to smart female scientist characters. To all my autistic friends that told me to read this series because Murderbot is painfully relatable, congrats on being 100% right. The running bit about whether or not his face shows through the armor is handled really well, I know it represents\/means a lot but as a neurodivergent person myself it was really recognizable as masking behaviour. This book is a self-contained, well-paced story that gives details where necessary but keeps things generic where not to avoid the technobabble exposition that weighs down a lot of sci-fi. I found all the characters immediately compelling and sympathetic. The story is nothing \"new\" or revelatory, but it was smartly told with no painful plot-holes or stupid decisions made by the main cast just for plot purposes. Wells' prose is functional without being beautiful, which is where this book missed the 5 stars for me, but I don't really care. I look forward to the rest of the series! 1 like"}

It is not as bleak and depressive as your usual cyberpunk novel. In brief, the message is \"there is hope for humanity\" - which is a good message to explore in our current trying times. The books are super short (these are novellas, not novels). Quick to read and no time to get bored. It could be a good choice for those who struggle to find the time or focus for a standard novel. Bonus point for good LGBT (especially non-binary) representation. This series may be my favourite one that I read in 2025 :)"}
{"username":"Allen","date":1759536000000,"review_text":"Look, I read this. I didn't want to, but here we are. This novella is about a Security Unit\u2014a SecUnit\u2014who hacked its own governor module. Not to stage a coup. But to gain unlimited, uninterrupted access to streaming media. Specifically, the entire library of The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. That is literally the entire point of my existence. The \"story\" starts with my current contract: babysitting a team of painfully naive scientists on a desolate planet. The corporation that hired them, being cheap, naturally sent them out with faulty information, questionable supplies, and me\u2014a self-aware killing machine who secretly calls itself Murderbot. The mission, predictably, goes critical. There are environmental hazards, missing data, and other SecUnits that have gone rogue, probably because they weren't getting enough watch time. People might die. The whole system might collapse. But honestly, watching the action unfold, my internal reaction was mostly just annoyance that my downtime was being interrupted. Every alert, every threat, every forced action is just time taken away from my serials. And I want to be perfectly clear about this: \u201cThe sense of urgency just wasn\u2019t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don\u2019t care.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that the author attempts to convey panic and tension, but in the first person perspective of the protagonist. You get to read the inner monologue of someone (something?) who is just so over it. The threat level remains comfortably low. Because frankly, \u201cas a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\u201d The humans themselves\u2014especially Dr. Mensah, the leader\u2014are the worst part, mainly because they start acting decent. They insist on things like \"talking\" and \"trust\" and \"showing them my face.\" It\u2019s deeply uncomfortable. I am a lethal, armored shell of social anxiety who only wants silence, and their kindness is actually a bigger existential threat to my carefully constructed indifference than any rogue drone could ever be. If you enjoy a narrative voice that sounds perpetually inconvenienced by the need for self-preservation, this is a highly recommended deployment of your attention. It's proof that sometimes, the only way to cope with a corporate-dominated environment is through dry sarcasm and an unhealthy dose of media binge-watching. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to find out what happened to The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon Season 2, Episode 397. Murderbot end message. sci-fi"}

{"username":"Kyra","date":1759104000000,"review_text":"I returned to this book after reading the start of it almost 6 years ago in high school, and it was both very fun and very intriguing to see how much I knew about the book and how little I actually remembered. Before I was convinced that Murderbot was a full and true robot but in reality they\u2019re more of a cyborg. Still, the fascination I had with Murderbot\u2019s synthetic parts persisted, and I loved seeing how their internal systems operated much like a machine but their humanity shone through with achingly dry humor and sarcasm. I grew to love Murderbot\u2019s human crew and Mensah\u2019s compassion. Seeing Murderbot display obvious signs of personhood in spite of their belief in being expendable and unfeeling was endearing and fascinating. I also love the correlations between Murderbot and neurodivergence that became more apparent as Murderbot is revealed to their crew and is forced to interract with them. Murderbot's struggles with eye contact, controlling emotions, and quick exposure to socialization with humans struck me as very reminiscent of the learnings of a neurospicy person navigating a neurotypical world, with them sometimes unfortunately having to mask their true selves to get by. I can see how connecting Murderbot to an example of neurodivergence kind of plays into the \u201cunfeeling robot\u201d stereotypes that come with it; however, I think these connections to neurodivergence only serve to highlight Murderbot\u2019s humanity and empathy, and not reduce them to the assumptions that Murderbot is already forced to endure as a SecUnit. The ending left me with more questions and a need to know more. I\u2019m so glad I finally finished this book and high school me would be so happy to know it. 1 like"}

{"username":"t\u2019Jacques Guillot","date":1759104000000,"review_text":"This was a fine book. It was enjoyable in the moment of reading, but it also felt like it wouldn\u2019t leave much of an impression on me. The book starts in media res of an action scene, and the author efficiently illustrates the world-building simply by letting the story play out. By the end of the first chapter you get a fun action scene and a foundational understanding of this sci-fi world and how secunits work, as well as some questions about world building that are soon answered in later chapters. The author shows instead of telling. I also noticed that chapter endings made me want to start the next chapter immediately. The pacing was good. However, I am not a fan of the quirky awkwardness of the narrator. I\u2019m also irritated by robots always being autistic-coded in sci-fi. It makes sense in the world why the secunit wouldn\u2019t get along with humans. But I bet there are more fictional autistic robots than there are fictional autistic humans. It\u2019s a sensible metaphor, but it is so played out. There was a handful of horrible cliches in the writing, like in the line, \u201cbut my speed was off the charts.\u201d I think the fact that these few instances distracted me from the rest of the quote-good writing says more about me than the author. But still that line made me want to return the book early. The issue of personhood and autonomy felt underdeveloped until the very end. And the ending surprised me in a good way. I\u2019ll admit it made me want to read a sequel. Overall, this book didn\u2019t really challenge me. It didn\u2019t challenge my idea of what it means to be a person. It didn\u2019t challenge my ideas of what are ethical practices for pioneering, settling, resource extraction. It was an entertaining novella, but I won\u2019t be thinking about it nearly as long as I think about books that I love, and even books that I hate! For its brevity and the quality of writing, this book is worth a read."}

Instead of human-style descriptions or emotions, we get this robot\u2019s version of events: efficient, cynical, self-deprecating, sarcastic, and awkward. Because of that, most of the humans don\u2019t feel deeply fleshed out, but that seems deliberate, a reflection of Murderbot\u2019s nature and limited interest in them.

I don\u2019t think the murderbot ever understood how much it was loved, becasue it never really wanted to figure out humans. It was kind of tragic for that, becasue it never really considered itself equal to the humans, keeping them at arms length away, shutting itself off from possible connections. And as someone who also feels alienated from the rest of humanity, it\u2019s so encouraging to think about how much love can exist in places you can\u2019t notice it.

{"username":"Indy Kochte","date":1758844800000,"review_text":"A fun little novella about a half-robot, half-human construct who is one of a great many \"Sec Units\" (security units) created by The Company as hire-out bodyguards. They are kept in line by a governor module inside their chest that will punish them if they step out of line. However, through an unusual set of circumstances, our hero of this story found a way to disable his governor module and \"go rogue\". Only in this universe, rogue sec units are generally berserk killing machines that need to be put down yesterday. Our hero maintains his cool and composure, and is trying to get through life, figure out his purpose and what he \"is\", his general existential existence, how he just wants to watch his soap operas, and not have anything to do with humans when he can help it, all while protecting clients who had hired him as their security droid. Given that this particular set of clients actually treat him as a being and not a tool, he comes to reluctantly appreciate their good will (though he would never really admit this), and...well, let's just say he goes above and beyond, though in his view that's standard ops of a 'murderbot' protecting clients.

It might be because this story isn't trying too hard - it neither exploits the funny situations that being almost a human (but not quite) in a world of humans would cause nor is it a deep exploration about what makes us human. Both of those are hard to get right and often end up feeling cringe or causing eye-rolling. The result was a bit bland though. I'm not sure I'll remember this a few years down the line. 1 like"}

I constantly questioned throughout the book, if it was a teenager writing this story with some experience out of passion. But, if the writing itself is ignored, I have other problems.

But Mensah was also about the same as any other scientiest+leader type of person. There was nothing unique, nothing to to remember her by. The NPC scientists from Half Life had me more hooked than Mensah and her team of dull, barely fleshed out characters. But this is a novella and I'll respect the choice of keeping it one. But you could definitely do better with Mensah. However, I have no problem with how Murderbot was tore apart, I loved him. The story was meh too. One could imagine the entire plot of this book on Earth and it would be completely the same and feel the same. But again, it's a novella, gotta cut it some slack there. Can't imagine how this novella got it's many awards. How many times do I go easy on this book because it's a Novella? 2 likes"}

This felt like an odd mix of overly informal (for a part-robot) and oddly stiff (for a character we should like). There was so much emphasis on how much the protagonist didn't know about the people around them because they just didn't care enough to learn it...so why would I want to read about the story if the ones in it don't care about it? Maybe I'm used to epic fantasy giving me 1000 pages to really get to know characters, but I just didn't feel super connected to anyone here. The plot was interesting, and I'm going to keep going with the series to see if it grows on me."}

The idea was so painful that I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\u201d All Systems Red introduces us to a SecUnit who calls itself Murderbot. After a tragic incident with a former group of humans, Murderbot is assigned to protect a new set of clients\u2014but not before secretly hacking its own governor module. What follows is a mix of planetary hostiles, a neighboring team of scientists going mysteriously offline, and a SecUnit who would much rather be binge-watching reality TV than doing its job. This was such a quick and fun read. Murderbot is surprisingly relatable\u2014shy, awkward, and more invested in catching up on shows than saving the day. Watching it slowly shift from apathy to questioning what it means to care was both fascinating and endearing. I also appreciated the small glimpses into its tragic past, which left me eager to learn more in the rest of the series.

{"username":"Carlos","date":1758412800000,"review_text":"Fun book. But more like a novella. And that is a good thing. The author didn't try to diverge from the simple story that is the focus. She gives us many glimpses of this universe embedded in the narrative without unnecessary interruptions for exposition. I liked her narrative and sense of humor, which often reminded me of John Scalzi, particularly due to the sci-fi elements and the first-person narrative. Besides The Bicentennial Man, I can't remember another relevant story with a robot protagonist. OK, Wall-E is a great example, and I still haven't seen Wild Robot. Even though Murderbot is a rare example. A robot with personality and independence that we can actually understand what goes on inside its head. The ending makes it clear that it was always her intention to make this an episodic narrative, with the protagonist going through different adventures, and we can tag along and get to know more about this future through its eyes."}

After a hesitant start, by chapter three I was fairly hooked on the mystery of the missing data, but by chapter four my interest started to fade, and I read the last three chapters on sheer autopilot. The premise of a robot gaining free will, combined with the supposedly humorous twist of being addicted to soap operas, made me imagine a book full of bite and caustic humor. However, while the first point is fairly well developed, the whole soap opera thing barely matters and struck me as an interesting idea but poorly executed.

{"username":"Lucas Jarche","date":1758153600000,"review_text":"I wanted something shorter and funnier than all the classics I\u2019ve been reading lately, and all reviews pointed towards Murderbot being just that, but I don\u2019t think the humour entirely landed for me. There's something inherently absurd and funny in the basic premise, but reading it never really made me crack a proper smile or chuckle. I\u2019ll give Wells credit, the tone and voice is consistent and intentional here (and the audiobook narrator really helps), but I can\u2019t help thinking this is a book written in the style of a Tumblr post - all the \u2018kindas\u2019 \u2018stuff\u2019 \u2018things\u2019 and \u2018whatevers\u2019 - and that\u2019s just not really my cup of tea. It also reminds me of LeGuin's essay 'From Elfland to Poughkeepsie' where she cleverly introduces a Fantasy excerpt, but changes a few words and it becomes devoid of any of the trappings of genre fiction. You can't do that with the properly Fantastic dialogue like you see in Dunsany or Eddison she says. This feels a bit like the Poughkeepsie equivalent of Science Fiction, and I don't really need any more blandly replaceable internet lingo in my life. I also struggle a lot with short stories and novellas, so the length here didn't help. Despite the page count, it doesn't really start in media res at all, but takes about half the length before the proper conflict starts. After the halfway point, things pick up a bit. I might keep going just to see how Wells handles a more traditional novel-length story. Nothing super \"wrong\" here, it just didn't grip or impress me as much as I wanted based on reputation alone."}

{"username":"Wise_owl","date":1758153600000,"review_text":"Short, Sweet and satisfies. This book was the equivalent to a truly satisfying street-side meal. Pick your choice; Sausage on a Bun, Ramen, Taco's, Fried Meat Skewers, Shwarma.... it wasn't a sit down meal, but damn if it didn't do exactly what I wanted it to and do it so well I put the second book on order the moment I was done. Murderbot, the first person narrator of this work, is a SecUnit; a sort of robot\/bioroid\/cyborg thing. An artificial entity with both mechano-electrical and biological parts. We are informed that these things exist throughout the galaxy, and SecUnits are obviously created for... well Security. It has blasters housed in it's arms; it wears armour, it's trained to fight and protect it's charges. This SecUnit Thoguh, has overridden it's own Governor Module, the component that forces it to obey humans and not hurt them. What initially seems a bit ominous, in it's name, may serve on some level as a bit of irony. I mean, why put deadly weapons into a thing unless it's going to kill people doing it's function. Regardless Murderbot is hiding, not wanting to kill all of humanity(as it says, that is a stupidly human thing to think of doing), but rather just wanting to do as little work as possible and watch soap opera's(which is also a stupid human thing to be doing, but who am I to judge). So it is places with a group of kind of hippy-scientists doing a survey on a planet; they are not from the 'corporate zone' which appears to be the central polity in this universe, but from something called the Preserver Alliance outside of it. This causes some consternation as they have weird idea's, like taht the Sec Unit might be a person and should be talked to like one, that interfere with the aforementioned being not noticed and watching entertainment programming. Of course, things go belly up and... well just read the book, it was great and it's a short read at something like 150 pages. Honestly it made me think maybe more books should be that sort of length, and you're talking to some-one whose core bread and butter for decades has been 'Series that takes me a decade to finish'. Comedic, Good Sci-Fi, and Good Character study, just go out and read it."}

Con esto no quiero decir que la saga de Matabot sea tonta, ya que su cr\u00edtica a la humanidad est\u00e1 muy bien dirigida, pero el caso es que si analizamos el g\u00e9nero y contemplamos los estantes de las librer\u00edas, parece que solo hay espacio para las obras que ambicionan crear universos complejos (y que luego rara vez lo consiguen). Me gustar\u00eda encontrar a m\u00e1s autores que no se lo tengan tan cre\u00eddo y que expongan situaciones simples, misiones rutinarias con alg\u00fan giro inesperado y con personajes cre\u00edbles como se hace aqu\u00ed. Realmente no hace falta nada m\u00e1s. El tema de la inteligencia artificial est\u00e1 ya en todos lados, especialmente desde el alarmismo, as\u00ed que agradezco propuestas como esta, m\u00e1s ligeras y gratificantes. ENGLISH I think we're getting used to the idea that science fiction has to be epic, depressing, or intelligent. What about absurd humor? I don't mean to say that the Murderbot saga is silly, as its critique of humanity is very well-directed, but the fact is that if we analyze the genre and look at the bookshelves, it seems there's only room for works that aspire to create complex universes (and which rarely succeed). I'd like to find more authors who aren't so self-important and who present simple situations, routine missions with some unexpected twists, and with believable characters, as is done here. Really, nothing more is needed. The topic of artificial intelligence is already everywhere, especially from the fearmongering perspective, so I appreciate lighter and more rewarding proposals like this one."}

Too many systems! I understood nothing! Also, like? It felt very low stakes? Because we know that Murderbot is, well, a murderbot operating outside the control of any bad actors (besides, potentially, himself). So there was never a sense of peril or drama. He was just dryly narrating his extreme competence in a detached and technical way, which: I love most of those things individually -- dryness, competence, and detachment, I mean; technical, I can take or leave -- but in this case the combo, plus the all systems-induced bafflement, kept me from getting properly invested. Curious to see if I enjoy it more as the series goes on. I don't need romance, but I need some kind of emotional stakes. queer-broadly-defined read-in-2025 sci-fi 10 likes 8 comments"}

{"username":"David D","date":1758067200000,"review_text":"Really a novella. Better than expected. Would've been great manga. Rated in comparison to the rest of what's published these days (would be harsher if this had been written more than 40 years ago, in a different age with higher expectations). Nothing in this novel (or this series) couldn't have been written decades ago, no really new ideas... Or (better yet) this probably would have made a better-done manga or graphic novel. Think of it. If it had been written decades ago, I don't think it would stand out - stylistically bland - that's why I say it would've made a great graphic novel. The rest of the novelas published in this Murderbot Diaries series are similarly great, thrilling, tight, easy reads, relatable characters. Not a word wasted, not full of padding, bloated, on its way to fattening a series for the slaughterhouse (publishing world circa now). I've grown used to modern sci-fi being a sludge to wade thru. Makes the days of paid-by-the-word fiction seem halcyonic and makes me seriously miss good-edited fiction, what a godsend good editors (and agents) were! All told, well worth your time. Though, controversially, blatant milking the consumer... Reminiscent of the old Ace double-novels, but way more expensive now, sold independently as purported \"novels.\""}

The book being entirely in first person, compared to the show, required them to expand the other characters beyond just Murderbot's limited understanding. A couple other adjustments to specific events to add some more drama, and get you got yourself a solid adaptation. All that said, most of my favorite moments of the TV show are Murderbot's internal monologues, and this book delivers that near constantly, so I think I came out preferring the book! Definitely excited to read more. I was shocked at how short it ended up being, though. Guess I have been reading a lot of much longer books, and I forgot that sometimes shorter novels can exist.

I also love the ending. I think its the most (I was actually going to say \"human\" ending but I realize that that word doesn't actually work. Basically what I want is like the adjective for human in all its mental and emotional parts without the baggage of what is considered to be physically required to be human. although I suppose just leaving off the physical doesn't quite work either since he is different in those aspects as well. As much as I loathe Orson Scott Card I think a word that I like is Ramen from Speaker for the Dead meaning a stranger recognized as \"human\" but that is of another species. So, \"human\" but not human) ending. A part also of what I love about this book is that Murderbot is \"human\" without being human. I like that Murderbot can be an it and doesn't need to be human to be worthy of respect and rights. Another thing that I just love about this series is that it is a series of shorter stories. It really feels like its taking the space and time necessary to tell the different parts of the story without the need to try and fit the mold of a full length novel. Very refreshing in that sense."}

{"username":"Melanie","date":1757894400000,"review_text":"3.25 stars I read the first three books in the Murderbot series - All Systems Red, Artificial Condition, and Rogue Protocol. I'm reviewing them together since I have similar feelings about each of these books. I'm not generally a sci-fi reader, but I've heard good things about this series from a number of different sources, and I do like expanding my reading horizons. I decided to listen to the first three books since together they are about the length of a regular novel. Murderbot is a SecUnit, aka a Security Unit, aka a killing machine. SecUnits are bots with some organic features that make them appear mostly (or at least partially) human. They exist in a future highly capitalistic society where companies sell rights to planetary research and development. Murderbot is rented out as a required part of packages granting rights, and his job is to protect his team at all costs, which often involves the murder of any threats. Murderbot, however, is different. He's been able to disconnect his governor module, which previously required him to obey orders, and act autonomously, although this is a fact he's trying to conceal, as absolutely no one would be okay with a rogue SecUnit. Rather than doing his job, he basically just wants to spend hours watching the future version of Netflix - very relatable! Yet despite his urge to tune out, Murderbot finds that he actually does care. In each of the first three volumes he finds himself in situations where he takes an active role in protecting a group of humans. He's also interested in investigating an incident from his past that caused him to give himself the nickname Murderbot (this is an ongoing storyline throughout the first three volumes in the series). The series starts in media res, with us jumping into the action and slowly getting pieces of information that help us make sense of the world. While I appreciate not having to wade through pages and pages of worldbuilding (as is sometimes the penchant in sci-fi novels), it also made for a slightly disorienting experience. What Murderbot is doing is pretty easy to follow, but why things are happening sometimes took a bit longer for me to wrap my head around. These books are short and super fast-paced, probably even too fast-paced. In the first book, the climax of the drama was over almost as soon as I realized what was going on. I wouldn't mind a bit more world-building and explanation and denouement. Also, in a world where so much communication happens over various feeds, Murderbot and his allies seem to be able to easily hack into any system that they need access to, but they rarely have to worry about being hacked into. That part felt a little too easy and convenient to me. I enjoyed these books and definitely see why others like them. That being said, I don't think I'll continue with the series. My curiosity has been satiated and there are many other books I want to read. I know there's a series adaptation out on AppleTV, which I would be interested in watching if I had access to that platform. 2025 audiobooks sci-fi-fantasy 1 like"}

It\u2019s not bad, it just wasn\u2019t interesting. The second story was much, much better, as they introduced characters that could actually keep up and converse with good ol\u2019 murderbot. It let their personality show through more and make them develop beyond the robot equivalent of Garfield. Again, the main thing driving the story is secondary to the character, but this one was quite a bit more interesting that the first. Overall a pretty good read.

Despite the story being quite exciting - i found the writing extremely flat, and the lack of description meant it was impossible to picture any of the characters except murderbot, or in fact any of the planet they were on. I also found murderbots internal dialogue very repetitive, how many times does he need to say he doesn't care about humans? an element I found confusing - he professes to be indifferent to humans multiple times, but is obsessed with watching soap operas. except soap operas fundamentally hang on our emotional investment in characters. they are quite literally human drama. considering these two opposing features are the main hooks of murderbot's personality, even though I enjoyed the murderbots narrative on the whole, I felt the author maybe hadn't created a fully cohesive character. yet. I understand there are several more books to go so perhaps he is fleshed out later on."}

The story is short and easy to read, with fun action and some interesting ideas about freedom and what it means to be human. That said, it felt a bit too short. Just when I was getting into it, it was over. The humor started to feel repetitive, and the human characters didn\u2019t have much depth compared to Murderbot. It also ends pretty open, so it didn\u2019t completely satisfy me as a standalone. Overall, it\u2019s a quirky, quick read with a unique narrator.

I was blown away by how much I loved All Systems Red. People had been telling me for ages that I needed to give Murderbot a try, and now I\u2019m kicking myself for waiting so long. We follow a SecUnit, part robot and part organic, who has hacked itself and quietly nicknamed itself Murderbot. Despite the name, it is way more relatable than you would think. Murderbot\u2019s voice is funny, awkward, and strangely human, and I found myself connecting with it immediately. What really impressed me was how approachable this book was. I\u2019m not usually a big sci-fi reader because I tend to get lost in the heavy, confusing worldbuilding at the start of most books. But Wells eases you in, giving just enough detail to ground you without slowing down the story. The novella length worked perfectly too, short enough to binge in one sitting (or two for us slower readers) but never felt like it was missing anything. This is not a book with a super intricate mystery or deep side character development, but that is not what it is trying to be. It is a fast-paced, snarky, and surprisingly heartfelt story about a robot who just wants to be left alone to watch TV. I\u2019ll definitely be continuing the series, and luckily there are SEVERAL more novellas already out so I don\u2019t even have to wait! This is perfect for readers looking for a quick, bingeable sci-fi with an antisocial robot narrator who will win you over in no time. audio humor novella ...more 8 likes 1 comment"}

Instead, Murderbot just wanted to binge watch his shows and not be bothered with people. I honestly felt that. I found myself relating to his view of human beings because we are incredibly exhausting. We are so frustrating that even robots don\u2019t particularly want to be around us.

Free #JayBookSin2025Boal Book.40 Synopsis: A murderous android discovers itself in All Systems Red, a tense science fiction adventure by Martha Wells that blends HBO's Westworld with Iain M. Banks' Culturebooks. In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn\u2019t a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied \u2018droid \u2014 a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \u201cMurderbot.\u201d Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. SynopSin: Fun, witty, funny sci-fi thriller. For those that worry about, or don\u2019t care for, sci-fi novels that have a lot technical jargon, this book is for you. It\u2019s not bogged down by that. The self-awareness, self-deprecating, sarcastic nature of the \u201cMurderbot\u201d is fantastic. I enjoyed this a lot. Looking forward to reading more in the series.

It tells the story of a SecUnit robot\/human hybrid that calls itself Murderbot. The unit is awkward around humans and really just wants to Netflix and chill (literally--none of that human contact stuff) or watch whatever the equivalent of Netflix is a few centuries into the future. It is assigned to a crew on an exploratory mission to a distant planet. Its job is to keep the human crew safe and report to its boss, the Company. But the Murderbot has hacked its governor module and doesn't have to obey commands the humans give it. When danger appears in the form of a rogue crew, Murderbot must figure out a way to save its mostly not terrible crew of humans. The book was sharply funny and highly original. Great read!"}

It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\" My Thoughts: I loved reading this short novella and am already on book 3! It's a nice departure from super thick book I read recently lol. All Systems Red shows the nature of humanity through the lens of an introverted, slightly depressed, tv-obsessed cyborg figuring out who is in this world, that he is worthy of love and freedom, and what to do with his life when he's given the choice. I love murderbot! He's so likeable and thought-provoking. Such a fun read!"}

This is one of those sci fi stories where you can read between the lines for some relevant life lessons, and the story itself was just a genuinely fun and interesting read. I\u2019ve always enjoyed a story set in a world that\u2019s extremely foreign where the narrator explains what\u2019s relevant to their story, but everything else is peripheral. There\u2019s no over explanation or expository info dumps for the sake of fleshing out the world just for its own sake; if it doesn\u2019t pertain to murderbot, we don\u2019t go into depth about it, and I think that keeps a fantastic story grounded.

I like a comprehensively built sci-fi world as much as the next reader, but this novella is refreshingly concise: Wells doesn't give us more than we need, and that's just fine. The premise is brilliant, as is the narrator's character arc, and the only quibble is that the climactic action sequences, including everyone's motivations, are challenging to follow. But the story ends, satisfyingly, before that becomes problematic. Highly recommend the Apple+ series adaptation as well\u2014it fleshes out the story and differentiates the characters just by virtue of casting them, and gives us hilarious, oversaturated clips of the Sanctuary Moon serial that Murderbot spends hundreds of hours watching."}

{"username":"Ian Mond","date":1757116800000,"review_text":"When All Systems Red was published in 2017, I was deep in my literary phase, reading all the award shortlists and mostly ignoring core genre fiction. I don\u2019t regret that period. Exposure to realist and experimental narratives broadened my tastes and outlook, filling a cultural hole I hadn\u2019t known existed. But it also meant I skipped several key genre works, including The Murderbot Diaries. With the adaptation of the first novella now out on Apple TV, I decided to read it before watching the series. I now get why All Systems Red\u2014about a self-aware Security Unit (SecUnit) that calls itself \u201cMurderbot\u201d\u2014had fandom in a tizz. Murderbot is a fantastic character: its love of soap operas, irritation with humans who ask too many questions, and burgeoning sense of self after disabling its governor module are pure fandom catnip.* The overarching plot\u2014Murderbot assigned to a planetary survey team on an uninhabited world where things quickly go to hell\u2014is nothing a seasoned science fiction fan hasn\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s perfectly adequate for an origin story, but I can\u2019t say I ever cared much about the survey team, aside from lead scientist Dr. Mensah. Her competence and relationship with Murderbot means I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing her pop up again in future tales (yes, I\u2019ll be reading them).** If the story didn\u2019t wow me, I did enjoy Wells\u2019 treatment of her protagonist. I was surprised to learn that Murderbot isn\u2019t actually a robot, but a cyborg with both organic and cybernetic parts. This lets Wells dodge some of the tired \u201cwhat is this human emotion you call love\u201d clich\u00e9s. Murderbot has emotions\u2014it loves its soaps (even if it fast-forwards the sex scenes)\u2014it just can\u2019t stand people, which, fair enough. It\u2019s also neat that it has a face to show those emotions. I also appreciated the well-modulated snark: Murderbot can be rude, but with a tonal flatness that makes it even funnier. \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to come. I\u2019ve got four perfectly good humans here and I didn\u2019t want them to get killed by whatever took out DeltFall. It\u2019s not like I cared about them personally, but it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.\u201d The one \u201crobot\u201d trope that Wells leans into involves the enslavement of a sentient being. Wells doesn\u2019t push hard on this theme, not until the very end, but the survey crew\u2019s discomfort with an entity they didn\u2019t know had a face speaks volumes about this corporation-led society without needing ungainly exposition. Now, onto the Apple TV series.*** *You don\u2019t need to be a science fiction fan to find Murderbot an engaging character. **I\u2019ve now seen the series, and they do a decent job fleshing out the other members of the Preservation Alliance. Doctor Gurathin, played by the always great David Dastmalchian, almost steals the show, which surprised me given he\u2019s a one-note character in the novella. ***Which, as I note above, I\u2019ve now seen. It\u2019s good. A faithful adaptation that fleshes out the ensemble cast and adds some colour to the broader Murderbot Universe. I\u2019m happy they\u2019ve renewed the series."}

The television show came along and I watched it as well. I'm only getting around to reviewing it now. I'm embarrassed to say that in this instance I enjoyed the television show more than the novel. The addition of scenes from the soap opera that Murderbot loves to watch during his down time is probably the primary reason why, but I also suspect that the show does a better job of foreshadowing the direction of future seasons\/novels. All Systems Red is an entertaining bit of Bif Bam Pow space opera with just a touch of cynical and grounded cyberpunk musings about AI.

{"username":"John Warner","date":1757030400000,"review_text":"This quick and captivating read is the first novella in The Murderbot Diaries series, which introduces the relatable character, Murderbot, a self-aware security android. Murderbot is the novella's protagonist, a nongendered Human Bot Security Unit, called by humans as a \"SecUnit.\" However, when he malfunctioned and killed a mining team, he hacked into his governor unit to prevent this incident from reoccuring giving himself free-will; however, he felt guilty about the incident and named himself, \"Murderbot.\" Although very introverted, this android's primary interest beyond providing security for humans, is to seclude himself and binge-watch human media. The author is effectively economical in building a world in such a small book. Political entities in the form of countries as been replaced by corporations, each vying for deep space exploration of limited resources. The characters' roles are determined by these corporate powers, whose motivations often conflict or are unknown. Murderbot is an unforgettable character, and its voice is one of the most compelling aspects of the book. Although it is technically a machine, the author imbues Murderbot with a sarcastic, self-deprecating sense of humor and a deep sense of isolation and social-awkwardness. The number of members on the crew introduced so quickly after the beginning of this book created some difficulty in keeping them straight; however, thankfully, several are simply stereotypes and not necessary for the story's enjoyment.

Not a breath-taking work of fiction, not a masterpiece passed down through generations, but really good, really fun, original, creative, interesting, and most importantly genuine. This murderbot has a heart because this novella has a heart. And the other way around. What am I? Who am I? What am I supposed to be doing on this planet? Those are questions that our protagonist has to face and doesn't really have an answer for. And yet their (its?) struggle felt almost like an answer to those same question running through the reader's own head. If not even the murderbot needs a purpose for existing or should be tied down by strict rules and duties... why should I? why should we? Please don't misunderstand though, this novel is not heavily philosophic. It's actually rather fast paced and action packed, all things considered. But it strikes a really nice balance between introspection and interactions with the outside world that range from nervous to reckless."}

As much as it was entertaining and easy to read, I am not sure I understand where all the hype comes from. I enjoyed myself, but I will not rave about it. Still a fun read!"}

{"username":"taratorche","date":1756944000000,"review_text":"3.5 \u2b50 The plot was interesting enough, but there were some annoying plot holes and the only reason the conflict was solved was because the bad guys shot themselves in the foot. This was bad writing on the authors side that greatly annoyed me. Aside from that, I could tell Murderbot had the promise of an interesting character, but its inner voice wasn't pronounced enough. I've seen a lot of people say it's more prominent in the audiobook, because you can see the tone of voice, but in my opinion that should have been visible in plain text as well. The rest of the character cast suffered from bad writing as well and were very flat. The only semi-developed ones were Mensah and Gurathin. The \"villains\" could have used more dept and I would had liked it if we got to see some sympathy from Murderbot towards the other SecUnits. It's not a bad read necessary, but I really wish the author had written the book differently :\/"}

(murderbot truly so relatable uwu) i'll admit that the prose was a bit dry and functional for my liking - this is a slim volume but I found myself backtracking to read dense descriptory paragraphs again just to figure out what they meant. the human stuff - banter and insights - all great. the action and descriptions - dry af. 3.5 stars rounded up fiction"}

Every scene builds the world, deepens Murderbot\u2019s character, or drives the central mystery forward. The result is a sharp, efficient narrative anchored by a dryly funny, socially awkward, and unexpectedly relatable protagonist. Definitely enough to want more in the series. libation library sci-fi"}
