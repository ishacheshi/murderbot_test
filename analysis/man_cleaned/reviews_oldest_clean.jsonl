The tone and character voice make this series so easy to love, and it's the same as we see in her other work. As the series title suggests, this is about a Murderbot - what the manufacturers call a SecUnit - who has managed to reconfigure its own\u00a0governor module though all it really does with the freedom is enjoy trashy television. Incredibly lethal, SecUnits quite rightly cause concern in those around them... and I mean, we've all been raised on fiction where robots decide it sounds like an excellent idea to 'kill all humans', so having one around for security who is armed to the teeth and perfectly calibrated for murder? Great! Imagine how the humans would react if they found out that their security unit isn't under the control of its governance module, eh? What adds an interesting level of complexity is how human Murderbot looks, which is why it usually leaves the helmut opaque. What's also interesting is that it can feel pain and have emotions, and is mostly incredibly anxious around humans. It also carries quite a bit of distain for humans and yet also develops (or already has) quite high morals, and comes to react protectively of its humans without much time spent on the matter. At only 144 pages\u00a0so much happens in this novella. Pretty quickly the team Murderbot is hired to protect find themselves in far more danger than they bargained for. There are quite a few members in the team but Murderbot is\u00a0so much more interesting than all of them, expect perhaps the leader of the expedition, Dr. Mensah, who becomes somewhat important for our protagonist. With so much packed in its hard to review without giving much away about the plot. I will say that the reason it hacked its governor module is what drives part of this novella, and all of the next. Murderbot is going to be a series of novellas, with another three expected to come out in 2018. favourites read-2017 read-2020 ...more"}
{"username":"Jason","date":1494115200000,"review_text":"5 Stars All Systems Red by Martha Wells is A science-fiction novella made for my tastes. The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person. Murderbot really does not like interacting with people and would rather be on her own. She really doesn't take her job seriously and is quite sarcastic. Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a short adventure, mystery on an unnamed planet. As with all Wells novels this is a fast-paced well written story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The survey team comes under attack, people are killed, an unknown adversary. The story works as we get to learn more about our nonhuman protagonist. I really like this book and wish it was a full length novel.

{"username":"Sarah","date":1645488000000,"review_text":"All Systems Red was truly a delight. A snarky robot with a TV addiction? Who can resist that! All planetary missions must be supplied by the Company and they must rent a Company supplied SecUnit, an android security guard. The narrator of All Systems Red is one such SecUnit, but it has hacked into the governor module and is now secretly autonomous. It refers to itself as Murderbot, and it really doesn\u2019t care about it\u2019s job \u2014 guarding a team of scientists on a remote planet where there shouldn\u2019t be problems anyway. Murderbot much prefers to hack into a satellite and gain access to 35,000 hours of entertainment media. This works out perfectly fine for Murderbot until a neighboring mission goes dark and their own humans may be in danger. The plot is not what\u2019s important about All Systems Red. Instead, this science fiction novella focuses on the inner life of it\u2019s protagonist and narrator, Murderbot. I know what you\u2019re thinking: this is probably one of those robot stories where there\u2019s a lot of angst and questioning about the nature of humanity. All Systems Red isn\u2019t like that. There\u2019s absolutely zero angst, and Murderbot finds humans awkward and slightly annoying. It says it likes fictional humans better than real humans, which is entirely relatable. Murderbot\u2019s voice was far and away the best thing about All Systems Red. It\u2019s hilarious! I was seriously laughing out loud while reading this. Robots with feelings are the best sort of robots, even if in this case our robot narrator is anti-social and largely apathetic. Although, Murderbot may be a bit less apathetic than it seems. While it professes to be horrified by the humans clumsy attempts to befriend it, it does seem to care about them beneath it all. As well as being astonishingly funny, it\u2019s also quite heart warming. I loved All Systems Red so much. It will undoubtedly end up being one of the best science fiction stories I read all year.

But this is not a cliched story of an AI gone insane who turns against its creators, but a deeply-felt tale about a being who is struggling with the idea of autonomy and the inherent uncertainty of freedom. Wells also adds to Murderbot's inner turmoil and his humanity by having him engage with fellow crew members that he doesn't particularly like or tolerate, resulting in frustration and annoyance which only makes it seem MORE human. It is a delightful read."}

The human group contracted for the rights to explore a certain sector, but it seems vital information is missing from their data packets. Sabotage or just 'low-bidder' incompetence?

{"username":"Cissa","date":1494374400000,"review_text":"This is one of the best books I've read recently. I love Wells's writing, and this is a solid sf tale with one of the best protagonists ever. It's novella length, so in that sense it's a short read- but it is so dense with details that it makes most full-length novels feel trifling. The protagonist is a security 'bot- a mix of human organic material and mechanical systems. It is aware, though, and able to tweak its own and other systems to its benefit, and to help others... when it wants to. I thought its thought processes and decision-making felt very authentic. Some reviewers have said it felt mle to them; to me it felt female, so that's an interesting thought experiment in itself! While it cares about doing a good job, it is not exactly dedicated to this; it has a solid grasp of its own self-interest (including having off-time in which to watch galactic soap operas), and keeps that in mind even when being mostly altruistic. This may be the most INTJ protagonist ever! I loved the book, and hope Wells writes more in this world! 3 likes 2 comments"}

Martha Wells is an author that's never left me down, a rare feat, and if this novella doesn't have the space to create quite as rich a world as she usually does, the strength of the murderbot's (anti-social, self-deprecating) character more than makes up for it.

I found it all very entertaining, but there was a more serious aspect, too: the Murderbot\u2019s misanthropic attitude and even anxiety about interacting with humans, especially without its suit and opaque helmet on as a buffer. Thus the interactions with the team were a little sad as well as funny \u2014 if not sad, perhaps the right term would be invested with pathos, especially as they interact more and more with their employers (contractors? not sure quite what the term should be).

Murderbot is a security \"robot\" who is trying to be her own person, even though she is technically an \"it\", kind of... Definitely raises some thoughts and questions. Anyway, looking forward to where she ends up next. 6 likes"}

It's starts slow as it introduces you to the players and the game, even the tech is revealed relatively slowly and in small quantities, with no big info dumps. Murderbot is interesting. Is it a cyborg? These SecUnits are part machine, part organic parts derived from cloning, but obviously with personalities and thoughts of their own. This is proved by the fact that they don't just run on programming, but that their own impulses and actions have to be controlled or curbed by the governor module. It's like a more versatile, upgraded, slightly less squicky version of Halva from The Ship Who Sang. Though being grown in a test tube probably isn't wonderful, I think it's a little better than being a stunted human body encased in a metal column implanted in a spaceship. Where does one's humanity stop or start? Human, cyborg, self aware synthetic being? This was fun, Murderbot had their own thoughts and plans and wants, and entertainment obsessions and anxieties and I'd enjoy reading more. Case in point, naming itself Murderbot. PS I also love that Murderbot is never prescribed a gender, seeing as they have no genitalia, and are free of gender constraints. dystopia science-fiction 1 like"}

When things start going wrong for the small survey crew it is security for, Murderbot is forced to taking action to save them and in doing so bringing its own peculiarities to the humans attention.

{"username":"Nadine","date":1589846400000,"review_text":"I finally got around to rereading this so I can continue with the rest of the novellas. I'm really glad I did because I didn't remember anything. _____ All Systems Red is a story about a team surveying a new planet told from the perspective of a security robot. Murderbot's perspective is a lot of fun. The robot is a hacked version of what it's supposed to be, so instead of being focused on the contract\/clients, it's more focused on watching television shows. It's sassy and has as carefree an attitude as a robot can have. The other characters served their purpose in the story. They filled the reader in on world building information and gave Murderbot a contract\/purpose. Other than that, they were just sort of there. This is usually a negative, however for the purpose of this story it works and allows the focus to be placed on Murderbot. The exploration of a new planet is one of my all time favourite science fiction plot lines. The exploration in this story was decent. The \"mystery\" is satisfactory, however I would have liked to discover more information, but that wasn't the purpose of the story. The focus of the story is on Murderbot as a \"person\" rather than what's going on around it. Overall, All Systems Red was a unique novella that sets up future stories that I will be definitely checking out. If you're looking for a quick read that's fun and unique, look no further! 9 likes"}
{"username":"Liz (Quirky Cat)","date":1693440000000,"review_text":"All Systems Red\u00a0is about an android (partially synthetic, partially organic) that is charged with protecting a scientific team on a new and relatively unknown planet. Having no name of its own, it names itself Murderbot, which makes sense in a weird sort of way. It took me less than two hours to read, so it doesn't require much time investment (Though I would have loved for it to be longer). Murderbot is different from all the other SecUnits. It figured out how to hack its way to freedom. Now, he doesn't have to follow orders or install updates automatically. Instead, it can watch all the crummy TV he wants. It pretends to do everything it was programmed to do so nobody catches on, but it isn't required. Human interaction is awkward for Murderbot. It knows it's not one of them, and they know that, making it difficult for MurderBot to move past it. Despite this, MurderBot grows truly attached to certain crew members it's protecting. Everything about the interactions it has is oddly...human. It's endearing. My description here has barely scratched the surface of all that makes MurderBot so amazing; please trust me on this! I have read (and listened) to this whole series at least a dozen times at this point...realistically that count is a whole lot higher. It is safe to say that MurderBot has stolen my heart. The characters and the series live rent-free in my mind. In fact, it recently occurred to me that MurderBot is to me what Sanctuary Moon is to MurderBot. That gave me a good chuckle. Enjoy! Highlights: Cyberpunk meets Solarpunk Rogue Android\/SecUnit Sarcastic Characters Space Adventures Graphic Audio Review: In case you haven't heard the news, Graphic Audio recently released their production of All Systems Red, the first novella in the MurderBot Diaries series (one of my favorite series of all time). Naturally, I pre-ordered the shit out of that. Since its release, I've listened to it three times. Yes, I know. At first, listening to the Graphic Audio version of All Systems Red was strange. I'm used to hearing Kevin R. Free's voice, especially for MurderBot. This made me think I didn't like it, or at least I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. Then I listened to it again. It works; it really does! David Cui Cui portrays MurderBot in a slightly different manner than Kevin R. Free. The sarcasm is less of a constant presence. However! His voice helps to highlight other elements of MurderBot's character (such as their more atypical nature). Speaking of casting and characters, I think the voice for Ratthi (Zeke Alton) is my favorite. Mensah's voice (Khaya Fraites) sounded a little younger than I expected, but otherwise, I don't have any complaints. If you're on the fence about trying All Systems Red by Graphic Audio, I would highly suggest trying it. It's a fun listen!

The idea was so painful I dropped to 97% efficiency. I'd rather climb back into Hostile One's Mouth. \"All Systems Red\" is a sci fi novella about a snarky robot which has developed independent thinking, in the same ilk as HK-47 or K2SO. In a lot of ways, this is a cliched story. Ever since robots were conceptualized, we have seen stories where robots aspire to be human or develop human feelings. 'The Bicentennial Man' and The Robot series, both by Asimov, are a great example of this. This book, while not at the same level as the seminal stories listed above, is still a good read. It stands out due its humour and well written characters. The first person perspective goes a long way towards letting the reader empathize with the protagonist, Murderbot. This book would have been better had it been longer and given us more time with murderbot. I am looking forward to seeing how murderbot evolves in future stories. 5 likes"}

Unfortunately, as the only security unit assigned to a group of researchers on an unexplored planet, Murderbot's job is already cutting into its media time, and then, of course, everything starts to go wrong. I loved this novella. The voice is great\u2014dryly funny, yet secretly compassionate. The humans had personality even though\u2014outside of the two most important to the plot\u2014they all seemed basically the same. Look, Murderbot doesn't care, okay? Except for how it does. My only complaint is that the ending is a bit rushed. I bought it, but the author should have taken a little more time to get there. Recommended\u2014especially if you like space toasters with social anxiety and jokes about murder. I'm excited for the next book in the series. May 2020: Rereading this and it's just as good the second time. Murderbot's social anxiety is still extreme. The Humans are still indistinguishable except for Mensah and Gurathin. Descriptions of network usage and action sequences are both still very effective and never use more words than necessary. And this time around I paid more attention to the fact that Murderbot would probably identify as agender and asexual.

Yes, it's a construct, and it's agender and ace because that's how it (they?) was constructed, but it's definitely a person, and the gender thing and the aceness aren't there to suggest that it's something that makes it\/them less human, or to mark the Otherness. Of course, all that isn't particularly relevant to the plot, apart from when Murderbot fast forwards through sex scenes in TV shows episodes because they're boring. Most of the time Murderbot is engulfed in a) exasperation, b) social anxiety caused by the inherent awkwardness of interacting with members of the expedition, or c) the profound need to be left in peace to watch TV shows. VERY RELATABLE. Also, solving the mystery and keeping everyone alive.

{"username":"Abiola","date":1495670400000,"review_text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how good this story was even though I had looked forward to something totally different. When I first requested my library purchase the book I expected something closer to 2001: Space Odyssey but this is much more enjoyable and palatable. It's a simple story, which is great when the genre has so many books that make things more complicated than they need to be...its also very short. That's probably my only disappointment since I'd enjoy reading more. In terms of story, there is an interesting, sarcastic android narrator, similar to Marvin of HG2G or K-2SO of RO in tone but much more amiable to its human clients in practice (which makes it a more attractive character to me). The plot is of the fight-to-survive-after-sabotage variety; while engaging, I found the narrators opinions on human interactions to be the books unique highlight, which I think is intentional. I definitely recommend especially to those who enjoy stories that explore well known scifi tropes, in this case the trope of the emotionally detached android teammate. It's a new release but I hope to see more books in the series. 1 like"}

Murderbot was a well developed character with traits which quickly made me interested in finding out how it was going to handle the situation it was in. Very engaging to watch it become more aware of its humans on their space exploration mission. I got a good chuckle to find that Murderbot withdrew from the noisy, emotional, overwhelming world of the humans by watching feeds of entertainment programs. The ending for this segment was a very good setup for more stories to come. I was a little apprehensive about the length of the story because I have been disappointed by short stories and novellas in the past because they never fully engaged my emotions. I didn't need to worry about that with this story by Martha Wells and I am definitely looking forward to reading the continuing adventures of this Imitative Human Bot Unit. novella science-fiction 4 likes 2 comments"}

And then dangerous, mysterious stuff happens! Wells writes a great protagonist and a unique one at that. A shy, introverted, apathetic android, who wants nothing more than to do its job (in the most half-assed way possible) and watch his favourite serials. Honestly, role model goals right there. Sadly, it's hard to say the same about the other characters, as the majority of them are named, given a one-two-sentence description and then left to run around in the background. This makes sense story-wise as Murderbot doesn't care much about the people around him and just wants to be left alone. But it evokes a very limited emotional range in the reader as there is no reason to care about these characters when they are in danger. The plot is actually somewhat cryptic with several points left unexplained, which worked surprisingly well for the kind of narrative the book presents. If Wells decides to develop the world of this story further in the next entry, it could turn into this cool, expansive universe with familiar technology portrayed in a new, exciting way. For now, this was a quick, witty read, lacking in substance but certainly rich in style. Eager to see the sequel! 2 likes"}

I enjoyed that this was written strictly from the point of view of Murderbot and that it lacked a lot of boring emotions, or at least those that Murderbot found boring, it made it all the more interesting. This was a very quick read and well worth the few short hours it takes to finish and I suggest it if you are a fan of HK-57 from the Star Wars Old Republic games, thou be advised Murderbot is not all that witty yet but I expect it will become so."}
{"username":"April","date":1496448000000,"review_text":"This is a lovely gem of a novella. I read it and then reread it again immediately, just so I could continue to be with the very compelling main character, who has a wonderfully intriguing viewpoint. Our SecUnit (a kind of cyborg clone) is in the middle of a boring planetary survey with its clients, about whom it knows nothing. Why should it? To them, it is just equipment the survey company requires them to bring along to increase its profit and cut costs. In just 150 short easy pages, I grew to care a lot about this bot. It loves watching entertainment videos, saying, \"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\" (p.9) Starting with its override of a automatic command not to save one of the humans from being eaten by a local monster, the bot gradually gets drawn in to protecting \"my humans.\" The mystery is why the humans are being targeted, and one of the things I love about this book is that the answer doesn't fit your standard planetary expedition adventure. Another reason to love this book is that Wells is a master at expressing the feelings of an outsider who is so lonely they don't even want to try to join humanity. That sounds depressing, but this bot is great! Favorite quotes: \"So, I'm awkward with actual humans....I know I'm a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous.\" (p.20) \" \"I got my helmet on and opaqued it. The relief was intense....'I love you armour, and I'm never leaving you again.'\" (p.95) From start to the finish, which was again non-standard (thank you, Wells!), I loved this adventure and the characters.

Wells does a good job of exploring this as Murderbot is confronted, along with its team, with some life or death issues. Apparently someone has hacked the information databases about the new planet they're surveying and left out some pretty vital info. Who did this? Why? And how do they not die while trying to answer those questions? That's the main through plot and it's well done. What makes this really good, though, is that Murderbot comes across as a convincing character with depth.

{"username":"Scotoma","date":1752019200000,"review_text":"This is one of the best science fiction pieces I read last year (I read it when it came out and re-read just recently) and while I haven\u2019t read much science fiction recently overall, I still would think it would have been among the strongest pieces overall. It\u2019s a novella, a couple of pages shy of a 100 pages, and yet it feels packed with content. Everything is told from the viewpoint of Murderbot, a robot, or android would be the better description, that has been hired out by her company to work as a bodyguard to keep a group of scientists safe on a mission to a new world, and then things go south very fast. What helps our intrepid murderbot is that it has hacked its own control module and is fully in control of itself, which is not how things should be. On a past mission, as far as it knows, it went rogue, killed lots of people it was supposed to keep safe, then its memory was purged and the murderbot repurposed. After all, it\u2019s not a being, but a piece of equipment to most people in this corporate future (only a few enclaves treat SecBots like their own being, and even they require guardians, which in the words of Murderbot, is a nicer word for owner). I say it since Murderbot doesn\u2019t have any gender or sex, although to me Murderbot feels more like a her than a he (which might be due to being written by a woman and I automatically assigned her gender to that of Murderbot, even If I shouldn\u2019t have). That said, the way Murderbot is written, it has aspects that intentionally make it hard to pinpoint as either gender, which I think is a really neat trick, as it makes sure you\u2019re always aware just how much it is different from humans. And yet, Wells managed to infuse Murderbot with so much humanity in the few pages we have, that its hard not to empathize with her. It just wants to do its job, not getting into the confusing social aspects of a tightly-knit group of human explorers or it\u2019s own feelings over its own humanity. Murderbot knows exactly what and what it isn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t want to think too much about these things and instead prefers to binge-watch hours upon hours of TV serials like the most ardent Netflix-addict. This obviously doesn\u2019t work out when an \u2018evil\u2019, hidden surveyor group tries to kill Murderbot\u2019s charges and it has to bring all it has to bear to survive and keep it\u2019s people alive. And this makes it clear to it at the end, that hiding from its own humanity is something it can\u2019t do anymore because humans are all around, but that it doesn\u2019t want to be controlled by anybody, not even those it considers friends. What makes this work so well is the combined mix of an action-packed survival story, the mystery of the evil surveyor group and how fast the threat gets ramped-up from random glitches to murderous intent and the seamlessly integrated exploration of a believable android trying to grapple with its own existence. After nearly a 100 years of stories on androids and robots, I would have thought this topic would have been mined until nothing is left to do, but to be honest, this novella just showed me there\u2019s so much more and we have hardly begun to explore thinking about this deep enough. But this will suffice for now. prose"}

{"username":"Stephen","date":1497312000000,"review_text":"Novellas can be a tricky thing. They\u2019re not full length books, but they can sometimes still demand the same price. All Systems Red comes in at just 150 pages, so it\u2019s a quick read, but despite the length of the book, the true importance is the impact of the story. That\u2019s where this one shines. All Systems Red stands out. The style and narrative of the story, the voice of the main character, it grips you right from the start and compels you to keep going. There\u2019s humor, there\u2019s action and there\u2019s mystery as this sci-fi tale pokes it\u2019s head into the waters of a very interesting universe. It\u2019s one where hi-tech gadgets are curbed by businesses cutting corners to save costs. A place where planetary explorers get in over the heads with vicious lifeforms and deadly technology. But most of all, it\u2019s a story about a murderbot who just wants to watch tv. \u201cI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\u2019t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\u201d And so the book begins with the main character. A robot. A murderbot. Murderbot doesn\u2019t have a name. It\u2019s official designation is simply SecUnit, short for security unit, and it\u2019s tasked with the security of a scientific team on a far off planet. Murderbot is just one cog in the wheel of futuristic commerce. Corporations sell out shares of prospect worlds to parties interested, who in turn rent or buy all the equipment needed to explore that world, which includes security units like Murderbot. Part machine and part cloned human, Murderbot has no gender and, theoretically, no freedom. However, thanks to a hacked governor module, Muderbot has quite a lot of freedom. In most stories, that freedom would lead to a robot killing its masters to seek its freedom. In this story, Murderbot ends up travelling a very different path, which is what makes it fun. Now I don\u2019t want to spoil the story, so suffice to say Murderbot goes on an adventure on this alien world with a team of scientists and it leads to plenty of action and mystery. Yet the key that glues it all together is the humor. Murderbot\u2019s peculiar personality leads to some very fun quirks that makes the story so enjoyable. Murderbot knows it\u2019s a piece of junk made by a corporation using the cheapest parts to maximize profits. This in turns leads to some self-deprecating humor. On the other hand, you have this extremely advanced machine in comparison to what we actually have in reality. Murderbot has a true artificial intelligence and is capable of making its own decisions and having its own wants and desires. So what does an AI do? It watches tv. That right there is hilarious. While novellas can be a hard sell, All Systems Red is a must read story. Seriously, this is a sci-fi story you should check out. It\u2019s fun, unique, quirky, and a pure joy to read. This story in itself is rather self-contained, however there is another book on the way. Hopefully we\u2019ll see even more as I absolutely loved this one. I give All Systems Red a five out of five."}
{"username":"Rachel Neumeier","date":1497484800000,"review_text":"Okay, first, \"Murderbot\" is definitely a misleading sobriquet. The protagonist may apply that nickname to itself, but ironically. I mention this because the title was kind of a turn-off for me, but this whole \"murderous android\" thing is very much overblown. The protagonist is a construct with both organic parts and tech parts. Definitely a person, it is legally equipment. Generally it's rented to clients it doesn't think highly of, by a company it thinks even less of, which as you might imagine has cased it to develop a certain bitter cynicism. Despite this, it can't help noticing that its current clients are actually pretty nice people. When someone starts trying to kill them all, it gets personally involved ... and so the story unrolls, with a fast pace that keeps you involved straight through to the satisfying conclusion. I already know I will enjoy re-reading the first novella before reading the second. If you like: I've been thinking of Breq from Leckie's Ancillary series recently, and I must say that Murderbot reminds me of Breq in some important ways. Definitely not human, definitely a person -- and actually similar as well in how out of touch it is with its own feelings. This is another take on a nonhuman protagonist who is a good person without ever thinking of itself that way. I think people who appreciated the Ancillary series ought to like this novella quite a bit. 11 likes"}

The book had me from the very beginning, curious character, good writing style that is to the point but manages to build a world around our characters. I recommend it if you're in the mood for a quick SciFi read. Here is the beginning: \"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It has been well over 35000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\" read-2017 1 like"}

Good thing: The Murderbot character was great - shy around humans, just wants to sit and watch his entertainment shows. Bad thing: I wasn't a huge fan of the ending. This is a fun, fast novella-length read. I want to see what Martha Wells does next with the character so I'll likely read the sequel.

I began the first page with reservations and by page three I was charmed into complete immersion. I\u2019m not kidding when I say I read this book in almost one sitting. I was so comfortable in this book, so reluctant to surface from my reading bubble, at one point I tried to get my cat to flip the light switch for me \u2013 the sun had gone down and I couldn\u2019t keep reading without the light, but I didn\u2019t want to stop even for a minute. That said, this is absolutely an easy \u201cone sitting\u201d read. The characters are full and entertaining, the central concept as clearly brought to life as is the world Wells has created. Honestly, I cannot believe how much emotion and life Martha Wells effortlessly fit into 150 pages. I\u2019ve referred before to authors whose \u201cmagic\u201d lies in this accomplishment or that skill, and to me this is Wells\u2019 skill: she puts not only a fully realized narrative and cast of characters in a tiny package, but creates what feels like a living, breathing world and narrative arcs readers will invest in into a travel sized snack of a book! One of the things I watch out for as I\u2019m reading is how quickly I can get \u201cinto\u201d a new book. This is partly down to author\u2019s style and voice, and partly down to how quickly the author introduces me to the characters, the story, and the universe. I fell into All Systems Red effortlessly. I was not only hooked, but fully invested in the characters and completely oriented and acclimatized in the universe before I had time to realize what was happening to me. All in all, Martha Wells put together a romp of a tale in All Systems Red, and I cannot wait to read more.

{"username":"Silvana","date":1550275200000,"review_text":"What a fun SF novella. I bought this totally on a whim a few days ago when it's on sale since the synopsis and the reviews look promising. Different with other books languishing in my TBR shelf, I decided to read it right away (a record!) since the Kindle sample grabbed my attention. It was so funny, if you like dry humour. The snarky, TV-series-bingewatcher 'SecUnit construct' with a penchant of saving its 'humans' because it actually cared. Well, just a bit. Not too much, since it did not even care who they were, or barely read his clients' personnel files (because it needed the storage space for its series collection LOL). Of course, the Murderbot - as it preferred to call itself - had some other motives for its actions. Still very rational and it knew what it wanted. It is not a lovey dovey relationship with the humans, it even tried really hard not to communicate too much. As an introvert myself, I definitely symphatize with the bot. I too need time to recharge and be alone whenever I have had too many human interaction. And I too, obviously, am crazy about TV series. So, there you go. I have not read too many SF with a POV from a robot so this one is definitely memorable. All in all, the novella is sharp, action-packed, has straightforward plot (because why not), no useless space for unnecessary world building, and of course, the characterization of the slightly depressed bot is marvelous - if you like Marvin from the Hitchhiker's novels, you'll like Murderbot. Kate Elliot mentioned in her blurb that All Systems Red is \"clever, inventive, brutal when it needs to be, and compassionate without ever being sentimental.\" I could not agree more. female-nonbinary-authors found-family mine-mine-mine ...more 26 likes 5 comments"}
{"username":"Fiona Knight","date":1748736000000,"review_text":"You may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I\u2019m a pessimist. All Systems Red is a spectacular beginning to the Murderbot Diaries series, from Martha Wells. Self-named, Murderbot is in the pay of The Company, guarding a group of humans as they catalogue various ecological systems on an uninhabited planet. But all it really wants to do is spend all day immersed in the thousands of hours of media it downloaded after hacking it's governer module to allow autonomy. That - along with Murderbot's reluctant warming to it's human charges - makes Murderbot one incredibly likeable and sympathetic protagonist. It's one of Tor's novella series, so it's definitely a shorter work. But with at least four planned in the series, there'll be plenty of Murderbot to keep you going. (Sidenote on third re-read - this series loses nothing on reread. Absolutely brilliant.) (Fourth re-read - pretty sure this isn't just losing nothing, but is gaining on each successive read. SO GOOD) (Fifth reread - late one this year! The Annual Murderbot reread is back again, and this series is still so so good :D) (Sixth reread - I could probably quote this by heart by now, but an upcoming new Murderbot novel means having an excellent excuse to read this series just one more time) absolute-favourites off-world scifi 62 likes 11 comments"}

But mostly, I liked the main character--\"Murderbot.\" Unlike many recent AI books and movies, this sentient machine\/cyborg isn't seeking selfhood and independence for some grand ambitions, but rather out of a surly anti-authoritarianism and boredom. Mostly, Murderbot wants to be left alone to watch its store of entertainment media, and when it has to interact with humans, it's with the greatest sarcasm: \"Confession time: I don't actually know where we are... I hadn't looked at the maps yet and I'd barely looked at the survey package... The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\" (p. 35) I definitely want to spend more time with Murderbot, which is good, as I just read that several more books are forthcoming in this series. 2023 audiobook sci-fi 1 like"}

{"username":"Tsana Dolichva","date":1705276800000,"review_text":"All Systems Red by Martha Wells is a novella I have heard a lot of people saying a lot of good things about. The only other book I've read by Martha Wells was kind of meh, so I'm glad the critical mass of people praising this book was well and truely exceeded for me to pick it up. It was an excellent read. All Systems Red had me from the opening paragraph which, as I immediately tweeted, was a delight. It's told in first person from the point of view of a cyborg. A bored cyborg who has gained free will and really just wants to watch TV between half-arsing its contractual duties enough to hide its illegal free will. Unfortunately, the survey mission that should have been straightforward and relatively dull \u2014 from Murderbot's point of view, if not the scientists it's protecting \u2014 turns out to be anything but. This novella was brief but excellent. It had mystery, danger, adventure, a compelling voice and made me laugh many times. It was also an interesting look at humanity and where the lines are drawn. Murderbot counts as machinery rather than as human because of how it was constructed. But it still feels emotions and has independent thoughts and we get the impression that even if it hadn't given itself free will it would still be having these thoughts and feelings, it just wouldn't be able to act on them. On the one hand considered non-human, on the other sentient and enslaved. And we see augmented humans who have some similarities with Murderbots in terms of data processing and telemetry (for lack of a better word) but are definitely human. I assume these are themes that will be explored further in the sequel novellas. All Systems Red was an excellent read and I recommend it to all fans of speculative fiction. It's a quick read and you don't even have to like robots or military SF to enjoy it. I cannot wait until the next novella comes out. I was sad when All Systems Red ended, not because it was a bad ending but because there was no more Murderbot to read and now I have to wait until next January for more. 5 \/ 5 stars You can read more of my reviews on my blog. 3 likes"}

In length: I had heard a lot about Murderbot before I read this. Remarkably, it actually lived up to the hype. Written almost like a diary, it allows the reader into the mind of a robot who has been tasked to look after some explorers - who don't realise that their robotic servant has no control chip, and is therefore choosing to look after them rather than simply and blindly following instructions. It's a reflection on autonomy, and choice; on how we treat those in subservient positions, the uncanny valley,and identity. It is also a mighty fine story that kept me engrossed and makes me leap for joy when I know there's at least another three in the series to come. female-author-2017 female-nb-gq-2020 female-nb-gq-2021 ...more 3 likes"}
{"username":"Elliot","date":1498694400000,"review_text":"This book was highly recommended by a couple people I trust, so I was expecting to enjoy it. I was not, however, expecting it to be one of my favorite reads so far this year. This novella was so much more than I hoped for. This is hard sci-fi with a gooey heart filled center (much like the Murderbot itself). The titular Murderbot was designed as a security unit, but has gained self awareness and individuality. When it hacked its security protocols to gain autonomy it didn't go on a murder rampage - instead it educated itself and became a media junkie. Murderbot is supposed to protect its clients, and it will, but it would really rather be left alone to watch serials. Interacting with humans is awkward and stressful, and when it comes down to it Murderbot just wants to be left alone. (I might relate to Murderbot a little too much sometimes.) If you look at the cover and title you would not expect this book to be funny, but I found myself laughing out loud numerous times. Murderbot's voice makes this book for me. Told from Murderbot's POV this sci-fi mystery is also a story about self discovery and the bonds we form (or do not form) with those around us. The world building was subtile yet rich enough I could imagine how this culture functioned as well as the technology being used. I loved the sci-fi and action, and I also loved the dialogue and character. While the secondary characters tend to run together a bit, especially in the beginning, that felt like an authorial choice due to Murderbot's POV rather than a misstep. I was invested in the outcome for all involved, which kept me turning pages. All in all I loved this novella, and I'm so happy there will be another one. If you've been hunting for a fast sci-fi read with a protagonist that's one of a kind, full of snark and world weariness that's actually earned, you need to read this book. archives novella queer-lit ...more 4 likes"}

{"username":"Ric","date":1522886400000,"review_text":"SF novella about explorers investigating a new world and their friendly murderous security bot. It calls itself Murderbot (for reasons embedded in the backstory) and it doesn't like socializing with the humans it is charged to protect. It has an affinity for watching long running docudramas, from which it derives its anthropomorphic responses to life threatening situations, of which there are many, in this gem of a first entry in the Murderbot series. Other than the charm of the lead non-character, the rest of the story is straight-forward: research group is attacked while on assignment in a newly-discovered planet, and have only their wits, and Murderbot, to depend on to survive and escape. The resolution is classic Niven or Heinlein or Pohl or even Hammett, using clues given in the body of the story. The best term I can think of for this book is \"cute.\" And it is, in an extreme sort of way, if one can view violent dismemberment and organic punctures as the willingness to be lovable. But there it is, Murderbot qualifies as both cute and lovable. Comparing this with another non-human bot in Ancillary Justice, I prefer cute to stolid.

Once again Martha Wells has created a completely believable non-human protagonist and I loved it (shout out also to the terrific samurai-esque cover art created by Jaime Jones - cover illustrators don't always get the kudos they deserve from readers.) Red really delivers in the main character of Murderbot (the book is first person from Murderbot's POV.) Murderbot is physically an organic-techological synthesis and the narration subtly reflects that synthesis; the character growth is beautifully done. And yes, I like typing 'Murderbot.' I also think 'Murderbot' would be a hellagood name for a cat. This is the second book I've read fairly recently that follows an AI character, the other being Becky Chambers' A Closed and Common Orbit. There's more meat to Chambers' (longer) book but I enjoyed Wells' Murderbot more as a completely other-than-human intelligence (Chambers' AI character is more about an AI becoming human). In All Systems Red Murderbot is growing its experience as its unique self and adding to that personality rather than learning how to be human, a fascinating perspective. Murderbot feels like a realistic non-human entity. Although I got my copy from the library, my love for Wells' writing is compelling me to pop for the hard copy and I'm already slavering for Murderbot Diaries #2. damn-that-was-good novellas sci-fi 11 likes 4 comments"}

In All Systems Red the reader is introduced to everyone's favourite SecUnit - Murderbot! In distant, spare faring future, where corporate super entities rule most of space, Murderbot is a security unit, or SecUnit for short, for one of the corporate-politico entities that equip smaller entities with all the equipment they'd need for an exploratory mission - for a price, of course. On one such mission, Murderbot is attempting to catch up on Sanctuary Moon, their favourite serial, when a neighbouring mission goes dark - and they could be next! Full of danger, fights, world building and Murderbot's snarky tone.

It could basically pass for a human with technical modifications. Murderbot is rogue in that it's hacked the module that sends it orders, so that it doesn't have to follow those orders if it doesn't want to. This means it can spend most of its missions ignoring all the boring stuff and catching up on soaps. Sadly, the current mission looks to be turning into a complicated one. Will Murderbot find enough peace and quite to catch up on its stories? Stay tuned to find out! As a main character, Murderbot has pros and cons. I like how detached it was, while at the same time got a little bored myself with some moments because Murderbot wasn't too invested in them. I hardly remember which of the human characters was which (with one exception) because Murderbot wasn't too interested in them as people (with one exception). That said, the mystery drove the plot forward and there weren't any \"unnecessary\" scenes. Really liked Murderbot as a character! Now that it has been established as a personality, I think its next adventure will be even more interesting than its first. Also, that the whole book was written as a transmission that Murderbot is sending out thankfully paid off at the end.

{"username":"Jerry","date":1499558400000,"review_text":"All Systems Red is a great, albeit short, book. I loved the premise of a robot that has become sentient. The story was solid, but it is the development of the protagonist that is the most compelling. Wells creates a believable world in which the characters can play. Other than being unable to resolve the main dilemma behind the book's premise (how does a non-sentient being realize that there is an elevation of his consciousness that is available to him), the suspension of disbelief is easy to achieve. Highly recommended, and hopefully there is more to come. Side observation: I've come to the conclusion that there must be a course in science fiction writing school that requires all authors to modify the \"quaint\" concept of marriage into something silly. All Systems Red is no exception. But, it only gets passing attention, so I only rolled my eyes two or three times during the story. --------------- I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between both sites. 5 - Fantastic. Life-altering.

I wanted to explore some anomalies I\u2019d noticed through the feed.\u201d He gestured to me. \u201cThis unit was already a rogue. It has a hacked governor module.\u201d On the entertainment feed, this is what they call an \u201coh shit\u201d moment. Through the security cams, I watched them be confused, but not alarmed, not yet. Pin-Lee, who had apparently just been digging around in my local system, folded her arms. Her expression was sharp and skeptical. \u201cI find that difficult to believe.\u201d She didn\u2019t add \u201cyou asshole\u201d but it was in her voice. She didn\u2019t like anybody questioning her expertise. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to follow our commands; there is no control over its behavior,\u201d Gurathin said, getting impatient. He didn\u2019t like anybody questioning his expertise either, but he didn\u2019t show it like Pin-Lee did. \u201cI showed Volescu my evaluations and he agrees with me.\u201d I had a moment to feel betrayed, which was stupid. Volescu was my client, and I\u2019d saved his life because that was my job, not because I liked him. But then Volescu said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with you.\u201d \u201cThe governor module is working, then?\u201d Mensah asked, frowning at all of them. \u201cNo, it\u2019s definitely hacked,\u201d Volescu explained. When he wasn\u2019t being attacked by giant fauna, he was a pretty calm guy. \u201cThe governor\u2019s connection to the rest of the SecUnit\u2019s system is partially severed. It can transmit commands, but can\u2019t enforce them or control behavior or apply punishment. But I think the fact that the Unit has been acting to preserve our lives, to take care of us, while it was a free agent, gives us even more reason to trust it.\u201d Okay, so I did like him. Gurathin insisted, \u201cWe\u2019ve been sabotaged since we got here. The missing hazard report, the missing map sections. The SecUnit must be part of that. It\u2019s acting for the company, they don\u2019t want this planet surveyed for whatever reason. This is what must have happened to DeltFall.\u201d Ratthi had been waiting for a moment to lunge in and interrupt. \u201cSomething odd is definitely going on. There were only three SecUnits for DeltFall in their specs, but there were five units in their habitat. Someone is sabotaging us, but I don\u2019t think our SecUnit is part of it.\u201d With finality, Bharadwaj said, \u201cVolescu and Ratthi are right. If the company did order the SecUnit to kill us, we would all be dead.\u201d Overse sounded mad. \u201cIt told us about the combat module, it told us to kill it. Why the hell would it do that if it wanted to hurt us?\u201d I liked her, too. And even though being part of this conversation was the last thing I wanted to do, it was time to speak for myself. I kept my eyes closed, watching them through the security camera, because that was easier. I made myself say, \u201cThe company isn\u2019t trying to kill you.\u201d That startled them. Gurathin started to speak, and Pin-Lee shushed him. Mensah stepped forward, watching me with a worried expression. She was standing near me, with Gurathin and the others gathered in a loose circle around her. Bharadwaj was farthest back, sitting in a chair. Mensah said, \u201cSecUnit, how do you know that?\u201d Even through the camera, this was hard. I tried to pretend I was back in my cubicle. \u201cBecause if the company wanted to sabotage you, they would have poisoned your supplies using the recycling systems. The company is more likely to kill you by accident.\u201d There was a moment while they all thought about how easy it would have been for the company to sabotage its own environmental settings. Ratthi began, \u201cBut surely that would\u2014\u201d Gurathin\u2019s expression was stiffer than usual. \u201cThis Unit has killed people before, people it was charged with protecting. It killed fifty-seven members of a mining operation.\u201d What I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn\u2019t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true.

This Vantablack comedy crosses the ethos of 'Star Trek' with contemporary corporate culture which results in some hilarious deadpan comedy. If 'Not giving a shit' was an Olympic event then 'Murderbot', the central character, would be guaranteed a podium finish if not the Gold Medal. The author uses this to great effect, many details about the setting are kept from the reader simply because Murderbot could never be bothered reading the relevant files. Despite this the story hangs together and avoids descending into silliness - the characters act in a sensible manner throughout the story. At a mere 144 pages this is a rather slim volume but it means there is no padding. If you like your stories tight and humour dark this book is definitely for you. 1 like"}

{"username":"Tanya","date":1500076800000,"review_text":"All Systems Red is the first-person narrative of Murderbot, a self-hacked security cyborg -- 'SecBot' -- who, due to having disabled their governor module, is no longer forced to obey the commands of the Company . (Note the pronouns: Murderbot may not have what they primly refers to as 'sex parts' but they are very much a person, possibly more so than some of their human clients.) Murderbot's current job is as security for a small group of scientists who are exploring newly-discovered planet. The expedition is facilitated by the Company, who monitor the team's conversations and communications, broker life insurance, and provide the equipment. Most of that equipment -- Murderbot included -- is supplied by the lowest bidder, so when a team member is attacked by an undocumented hostile lifeform, everyone assumes it's just a glitch in the info pack. It's not just a glitch in the info pack. Without Murderbot's sardonic commentary, cynicism and gallows humour, this would be a fairly routine piece of pulp fiction, albeit with a more diverse cast than is usual. But Murderbot is a delight: they would really much rather watch episodes of Sanctuary Moon than interact with clients (though they do have a strong protective streak towards 'their' humans). They're accustomed to being treated as equipment, and they like things that way. (Commenting on the cultural depiction of emancipated bots -- all those soap operas have given Murderbot a detailed, if not always accurate, understanding of human society -- they remark, 'If it showed the bots hanging out watching the entertainment feed all through the day cycle with no one trying to make them talk about their feelings, I would have been a lot more interested'. ) The humans, in turn, are not initially used to treating Murderbot as a person: they don't even recognise Murderbot without the helmet and the armour. How each of the team reacts to Murderbot is a fascinating sociological study: from 'ah, so we can punish you by looking at you?' (Murderbot is described as 'shy', but exhibits habits that could be labelled as autistic, abuse-survivor or simply introverted); to invasions of Murderbot's private personal log, to Dr Mensah, the leader of the expedition, who regards Murderbot as an equal and a person of value. Murderbot has a shadowy past, too. They hacked their governor module for a reason: and I'm looking forward to reading the next novella, which sounds as though it might explore that backstory a little more.More Murderbot from Martha Wells!

While this in itself is not unique, the hook is Murderbot now has free will, but he (or her since it has not sex) is still a bot, so it has to decide how to interact with people, not somehting it has much experience in. This has resulted in it being an introvert and extremely awkward around humans. Think of it as a highly weaponized, murdering, rogue robot with a touch of autism, that also loves soap operas, but with a heart of gold. What I also, appreciated is the book doesn't go into a whole origin story narrative about how it managed to hack it's governor and \"awaken\", etc. We've seen that before in other books. Now the Bad: Mostly it comes down to the book is thin; in many ways. First, even calling it a \"book\" is not really accurate. At under 150 pages it's really a novella at best, or even a short story. Admittedly, the author's Goodreads page describes it a such but I didn't notice. Because of this it's thin in other ways too such as character development, world building, even an interesting plot. The whole thing seemed rushed and glossed over somehow. Even the generic title \"All Systems Red\" sounds like it was just made up at the last minute. In the end I felt like I was shown a pretty cool concept, but was cheated out of an experience. It does appear to be the first book in a series and the main character certainly has potential. If the next in the series has more meat to it I would give it a chance. 3 likes"}
{"username":"Jaclyn Hogan","date":1735084800000,"review_text":"Is it strange that a novella about an anxious, misanthropic android is comfort reading? (Murderbot is not really an android, but that comes closest to what they are.) I've been reading a lot of horror and dark fiction lately, completely on purpose, but I realized I needed a bit of a break. Enter Murderbot. This series has gotten tons of good press in the sci-fi world, and if you read that stuff you have probably heard of it. If you have not, here's the elevator pitch. A security android (sorta) hacks itself so as to no longer be under the control of the company that owns it. Instead of waging war on those who have done it wrong, it decides to continue doing its job, at least half-assedly, and watch a bunch of shows. This is going pretty well, until the group it's contracted to provided security for is sabotaged and Murderbot has to save them. While doing this, it discovers it kinda likes these particular humans, and would like them to not die. The best thing about this re-read, for me, is comparing this Murderbot with the Murderbot of later books. Murderbot remains anxious and grouchy, but it's so, so much worse in this book. Murderbot is still used to hiding behind an opaque helmet, so having to talk to people face to face is deeply uncomfortable for it. At one point, it has to go face the wall to have a conversation. Another thing that's great is watching Murderbot improve at its job. It's a security expert, but it says many times that the company only cares about its clients to the extent that it would have to pay insurance on them. The company is also incredibly cheap, and Murderbot often comes up with ideas based more on the shows it watches than the actual training it has had downloaded to it. (Also, I hope no one finds me calling Murderbot 'it' upsetting. Murderbot has no gender or sexual orientation, and, at least at this point, doesn't really think of itself as a person. There's probably a good case to made for using 'they' pronouns for Murderbot, but I don't think that actually happens in the story. The story is in first person, and most people that Murderbot meets either believe it to be a thing, or they call it some alias it has picked.) Anyway, read these books, y'all. They're fun, smart, and Murderbot is a wonderful mess of neuroses trying to find its place, and time to watch its shows, in a world that's mostly afraid of it. aliens-and-outerspace crime-and-thriller futurism ...more 2 likes"}

Murderbot's such a fun, and--yeah--relatable character. I'm looking forward to continuing on with the rest of the novellas in this series. (My mini-review from the first read is below the *.) * The cyborg protagonist of \"All Systems Red\" is hired on, or rented, to act as security for a small survey team exploring a new planet. The autopilot on the team's transport is sabotaged while they are exploring an anomaly on the survey map, leading to an investigation into who might have done it, and why. \"Murderbot\" reminds me somewhat of Breq in the Imperial Radch trilogy, especially in how its interactions with humans, and its variance from others of its kind, open up questions of what \"identity\" means. Its lackadaisical attention to detail, its frequent criticisms of how cheap the company that created it is, and its awkwardness with the crew, made this story surprisingly charming and funny. The ending was perfect for a novella, closing off this chapter for Murderbot, and making me anxious to see where it goes to next.

{"username":"Marti Dolata","date":1500508800000,"review_text":"Until mid chapter two,when the point of view character stated that Security units like it had no gender or genitals, I was definitely reading the internal voice as gendered female.

{"username":"Hisham El-far","date":1500595200000,"review_text":"The Murderbot Diaries looks to becoming a series of novellas published by Tor.com - All Systems Red being the first novella in the series. This entire novella is told from the point of view of a SecBot. A sentient, genderless android built for the express purpose of protecting and doing whatever the hell its owners or lease holder damn well wants it to do. SecBots are essentially slaves. They are controlled by governor chips that limit them and reign them in. SecBots don't care much for Humans and most Humans don't have much time for SecBots. The SecBot in All Systems Red doesn't like them much either. Not so much hate, more apathetic disdain, it has also managed to hack it's own governor chip. A fact it hasn't seen fit to mention to any Humans. The only thing stopping our SecBot (Who calls itself MurderBot!) from doing whatever it likes (Mostly binge watching Sanctuary Moon on a future equivalent of Netflix) is having to pretend it's still a slave to the man. That's pretty much where this novella starts - and all I want to say about the story is that It is awesome. My only criticism is that it's not long enough! I need more MurderBot in my life!

The main character's grumpy and introverted internal monologue was fun to listen to, and you rooted for it through the whole thing, as it evolved and changed and began to have Opinions that it couldn't just hide while it pretended to be a good little nonsentient. The worldbuilding was secondary to the character's arc, but was still well-done.

Again there's a whole paragraph on this and it doesn't feel naturally integrated into the story at all. \"Look I'm trying to be diverse\". Yeah it's a robot of course it doesn't have to have a gender. Another thing is that the main character reads actually like a girl so this whole gender neutral thing is not working out. I'm not actually sure what a murderbot is yet, but I'm not reading the whole thing to find out. 1-star dnf 119 likes 22 comments"}

I wasn't really sure what to expect based on the premise, but I ended up identifying with Murderbot a lot (\u2026not sure what that says about me). I mean, it just wants to be left alone and not have to deal with humans so it can watch its favorite TV shows! I can relate. But really, this was just fun. I loved the dynamic between Murderbot and its shipmates and how they didn't really know how to act around it but wanted to take its feelings into consideration, and all the awkward conversations were so much fun. I also loved seeing how Murderbot would deny caring about any of the people but then demonstrate through its actions that these people clearly did matter to it on some level at least. The ending was also perfect, and I am definitely interested in reading more in this series. novella read-2017 science-fiction"}

{"username":"Aspen Junge","date":1501372800000,"review_text":"As a soulless, conscienceless, efficient killing machine, Murderbot is a miserable failure. Once he had hacked his governor chip and gained self-determination, he decided that, all things considered, he\u2019d rather watch TV than murder. But to maintain a network connection to the entertainment feeds, not to mention avoid an inevitable decommissioning and disassembly, he has to continue diligently performing the banal duties of a bargain basement corporate security droid. Skynet meets The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit. Murderbot doesn\u2019t really care about his job, or the Company that owns him, or the humans entrusted to his care. He is potentially capable of greatness, certainly of great evil, but he hasn\u2019t figured out who he is yet or why he should even bother. In this, Murderbot is every 20-something working a boring job. Sure, \u201csentient AI gains autonomy and embarks on a journey of self-discovery\u201d is totally a trope by now, but All Systems Red is the highest quality trope.

{"username":"Alli","date":1670630400000,"review_text":"Murderbot is my new fav and you can't take it from me. The slight dispassion, the ability to half-ass its job and not care, the awkward inability to make conversation, the discovery that it has some level of caring when the right subject comes along, and its ability to binge-watch TV is all so human and relatable that it's difficult to not fall in love with Murderbot. Murderbot isn't a traditional hero by any stretch of the imagination, but it rises to the challenge in ways that surprise itself, and that is the mark of a good character. The other characters in the novella are just as interesting, and figuring out their motivations is all part of the charm of this book. (Yes, I said \"charm\" about a book in which the main character is named \"Murderbot.\") Their personalities are part of the mystery as Murderbot (and the reader) has to decide who to trust. And the mystery! Unpacking what's happening to the survey team, what might be going on, who's responsible, and why is all part of the fun of this novella. I easily could have read another hundred pages with these characters and set in this world, but the tight pace, single-minded story, and elegant efficiency is part of what makes All Systems Red one of the best books I've read this year. home-library sci-fi"}

When you find yourself sympathizing with a misanthropic, introverted, sarcastic murderbot, you might want to examine your priorities.

I thought through some of it that the main character wasn't too bright at times, but it is explained away by the way the main character is programs. Murderbot doesn't really have a gender- gender neutral so the best way to describe the main character is well, main character or Murderbot. We do find out why Murderbot is called such and it may not be what one might expect which was an interesting reveal. It was nice to see that not all scientists are nutters and not all people trapped together have to be murdering crazies either. I liked that Murderbot's crew were able to maintain their humanity.

{"username":"Bonnie McDaniel","date":1511740800000,"review_text":"I was originally going to give this three stars, but I've been thinking about it ever since I read it. It's a book that sneaks up on you and lingers in the mind, and any book that does that deserves to be rewarded. The best thing about this book is, of course, the character of Murderbot: a self-aware SecUnit (security android) who has hacked its own governor module and removed the strictures that define its existence as a corporate-owned property. (The extent to which Murderbot--a cranky, snarky misanthrope who just wants to avoid interacting with people, read its books watch its downloaded entertainment feeds and be left alone--can be compared to this reviewer is left as an exercise for the reader.) Unfortunately, the planetary exploration team that has hired it comes under sudden attack, and it's left to Murderbot and its clients to figure out who is trying to kill them and why. (Yes, the term \"it\" applies here, as Murderbot is a sexless, genderless android. There's also a fascinating throwaway bit of backstory wherein Murderbot reveals its governor module failed before, resulting in the deaths of 57 people, and it hacked the replacement module to prevent this from ever happening again. I hope this is explored in subsequent volumes.) The story is fairly pedestrian and quickly resolved, but it's Murderbot's voice that carries the day. Througout most of the book it doesn't know what it wants (other than the next episode of its favorite entertainment feed), but once the crisis is over and its contract has been bought out by the grateful humans whose lives it saved, it realizes that what it's supposed to want and what it actually does want are two different things. I didn't know what I would do on a farm. Clean the house? That sounded way more boring than security. Maybe it would work out. This was what I was supposed to want. This what what everything had always told me I was supposed to want. Supposed to want. I'd have to pretend to be an augmented human, and that would be a strain. I'd have to change, make myself do things I didn't want to do. Like talk to humans like I was one of them. I'd have to leave the armor behind. For anyone who ever watched Star Trek: The Next Generation, Murderbot is the anti-Data. It's the furthest thing from the Pinocchio who wants to be human, and because of that it is as unique character I will definitely follow. The book ends with Murderbot taking off with a cargo transport, to make its own way and chart its own destiny. I don't know what I want. I said that at some point, I think. But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me. This is a lovely story, and I'm looking forward to the sequel. artificial-intelligence science-fiction space-opera 3 likes"}

My feeling at the time was that the story was slight and somewhat incomplete. But now, having read the current four-book Murderbot sequence, I find I missed some of the droll subtlety of the characterization. Think Robocop, but high on the autism scale and suffering from a media addiction and a guilty conscience he is not sure he deserves. We see all the other characters through his very foggy glass darkly. That is a little off-putting but, I have come to think now, stylistically audacious.

{"username":"Mark","date":1502582400000,"review_text":"Must admit, I didn\u2019t know that Martha Wells wrote SF. I do know her Fantasy books (The Cloud Roads, Books of the Raksura), and I thought that her involvement in a SFFWorld \u2018Round Table\u2019 forum discussion a few years ago was thoughtful and entertaining, but that for me was about it.* So I was quite pleased when All Systems Red appeared in my review pile. For All Systems is an out and out SF Space Adventure tale, involving AI \u2018killerbots\u2019, corporate shenanigans and nasty alien lifeforms on unexplored planets. It\u2019s a great read. \u201cIn a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn\u2019t a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied \u2018droid \u2014 a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \u201cMurderbot.\u201d Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.\u201d As you can read from the publisher\u2019s blurb, the situation isn\u2019t that different from current writers such as, say, Jay Posey or Ian McDonald \u2013 for those of an older persuasion, I\u2019m going to suggest Ben Bova. Where All Systems Red scores though, is that it\u2019s a great set-up \u2013 sort\u2019ve like a Science-Fictional version of Dexter. The voice of the AI known as \u2018SecUnit\u2019 is great \u2013 a knowing, rather sassy but clearly intelligent personality that reminded me of Heinlein\u2019s Mike from The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress or, at times, even Marvin the Paranoid Android from A Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\u00a0 It\u2019s clever and quite depreciating, which appealed to me a lot. \u201cI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\u201d Being a novella also means that there\u2019s no space for extraneous waffle. The book begins with a bang, and then rarely lets up. Our Murderbot (the reason for that name is told along the way, but I\u2019ll not spoil it now) is the SecUnit that has to be sent with a survey party by The Company (also later amusingly nicknamed \u201cEvilSurvey\u201d) to explore potential planets for development. In Alien-style plot development, whilst on a planet the team lose contact with the neighbouring survey team from DeltFall, something not too unusual with the cheap and basic equipment hired to them by the Company. However further investigation leads to the discovery of bigger mysteries and the consequences of their discovery. After 144 pages it\u2019s done. And I want more. There are things still unexplained - will the Company find out if the rogue AI is rogue? What is the Company really up to? And what\u2019s the bigger picture? The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, although I am pleased to type that there will be more in this series. In my opinion, there should be. There\u2019s a pace that meant I read this one near-non-stop, in two sittings. Besides, how often do you read a tale rooting for the bad-guy (who\u2019s clearly not as bad as it makes himself out to be)? Surprisingly good and thoroughly recommended entertainment. * (I now know, from reading the end of this one, that she has also written for the Stargate : Atlantis and Star Wars franchises, which makes sense.)"}

I think that this book succeeds where other novellas fail is that Wells understands that in this length format, you can't take several chapters establishing characters, setting up the plot, etc. She just throws you in media res, gives you a quick hook on the protagonist and off you go. I fell like if you don't do that (the novella River of Teeth springs to mind), the story's over right about the time you start to get caught up in it. Well done.

In that universe, there are humans, augmented humans, and constructs (which are part organic and inorganic but not easily divided). The story is about a SecUnit (security construct) who has managed to disable its governor. Now that it's autonomous (or as the company likes to call it \"rogue\"), it discovers that one reason for the governor is boredom and perhaps a bit of apathy which it chooses to fill with entertainment feeds, removing documentation it should've read to make room for more media. Being a free agent is not all its cracked up to be. The universe is consistent. Survey teams representing companies or organizations contract with the \"company\" to go out and survey planets. Sometimes there's more than one survey team on a planet. The \"company\" provides all of the equipment from the habitats to the supplies to the \"hoppers\" (surface transports) to the scientific survey equipment. All of the equipment, while working together, doesn't always work well (as equipment manufactured by the lowest bidder tends to do). The computer systems (the HubSystem, SecSystem, and MedSystem) are all interconnected and wireless. You can dip into the \"feed\" as if you were checking Twitter. There's a nice twist at the end which I'll just mention here for you to discover. Back to this book being short. Frankly I'd love to continue reading about this nameless SecUnit.

{"username":"Lindsay","date":1744934400000,"review_text":"This is at least as good as most of the reviews are saying, and it's an excellent example of what can be done with a simple plot and fantastic characters at the novella length. The story is told from the point of view of a rogue biomechanical security construct that calls itself murderbot. With its governor not working there's nothing stopping it from killing everyone in the planetary survey crew it works for. Well, other than it quite likes them and it likes being useful and having down time to keep up with its entertainment serials. So when it becomes apparent that it's humans are under attack, it goes out of its way to protect them, even to the point of revealing that its not under their control. I have to point out that murderbot is incredibly relatable to the average reader. It's extremely introverted, needs alone time to recharge for social contact and mostly just wants to be left alone. But it's also steadfast, loyal and at most times the most sensible and competent person in the room. In that respect it's like the Mary Sue of every reader ever. But the story transcends that. The character interactions with the survey team after they find out the murderbot's independence are brilliantly handled with humor and a wide range of emotional reactions from distrust to unwanted compassion. And murderbot makes a lot of sense. This is great and you should read it. science-fiction 65 likes 4 comments"}

Even its anti-social tendencies ring true, more symptoms of someone not used to interact than dislike, as proved by its loyalty and determination in saving its humans.

In my defense, we'd been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn't had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.\" I can relate to Murderbot, the misanthropic construct who is contracted to provide security detail for a small expedition to a planet. Murderbot, as the A.I. calls themselves (MB is sexless and has not chosen a pronoun), is plainly uncomfortable with personal attention and has little interest in anything outside entertainment videos and the bare minimum required to do their job. I have to confess that sounds like me during most of my adolescent years at every family event, ever, just substitute a book for video. \"They\u2019re academics, surveyors, researchers, not action-hero explorers from the serials I liked because they were unrealistic and not depressing and sordid like reality.\" Written as a novella, the plot takes off from page two. It isn't long before both Murderbot and the team realize they're facing multiple types of danger. Characterization is one of the outstanding parts of the story, with Murderbot's nature getting a lot of subtle build. The team never stood out to any great degree, but that's partly because until this expedition, Murderbot has had generally negative experiences with the people they have been contracted to protect and assumed this group would be more of the same. The leader, Dr. Mensah, soon distinguishes herself with crisis management and leadership, (\"It was starting to occur to me that Dr. Mensah might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer, even if she didn\u2019t look like the ones on the entertainment feed\") while an augmented human, Gurathin, presents a different kind of challenge. \u201cI do think of it as a person,\u201d Gurathin said. \u201cAn angry, heavily armed person who has no reason to trust us.\u201d \u201cThen stop being mean to it,\u201d Ratthi told him. \u201cThat might help.\u201d My one hesitation in calling it a five star book is the ending, which felt somewhat awkward and incongruous to the personality of earlier 'Bot, who displayed little curiosity or independence. I read the story twice, the second time doing the math on the length of time 'Bot has been independent. I'm guessing around four years, based on their own estimate of 35k hours since they \"failed to become an uncontrolled killing machine.\" The resolution felt like a shortcut, and like a logic failure in 'Bot's circuts. But I'm open to discussion on it. Final resolution aside, I certainly enjoyed the ride. I predict some kind of award nomination next season. Note from 2020: This is the first novella in a series of four, followed by a novel. Technically, they all are independent installments, a lot like the serials 'Bot is so fond of watching. However, once I was able to re-read the four novellas as a group--instead of upon release--I found the overall emotional arc\/plot even more enjoyable than as installments. Note from 2024: it's like a delicious bedtime story. \"I thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need... was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I'm a pessimist.\" Me too, Murderbot.

Murderbot is a delight, this novella is a delight, and I need the next one posthaste. From the first page Murderbot's voice leaps off the page - the wry humor (I mean, \"Murderbot\"!), the social awkwardness, the obsession with media. Super relatable. Then as the plot unfolds and Murderbot slowly becomes attached to its clients...I don't even know what to say about it, I just found it incredibly satisfying. I have absolutely zero criticisms.

{"username":"Bradley","date":1504915200000,"review_text":"When I heard the premise I expected a light robot killer story from the PoV from the robot. Probably a PI mystery kind of thing because that seems to be pretty hot right now. I can rattle off a handful of titles like this right now. So. What did I get? A fun and light robot murderer who hacks herself to have free will and she stops murdering to watch SF sitcoms instead. :) Honestly, that's pretty cool. Yeah, her official bruiser job is still there but her mechanical heart isn't really into it. Who can blame her? It's pretty boring until she finds that she really wants to protect people after all. The plot's fairly simple, the prose is light, and the premise rolls right along. It's mystery fluff with a hard SF chassis. Just what the engineer ordered. 2017-shelf sci-fi 206 likes 20 comments"}

As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\" All Systems Red is an amusing and surprisingly thrilling story about a security android who is paired with a research team sent to a distant planet. Unlike other security units, this one has hacked its governor module, allowing it to act for itself though it must conceal this unless it wants to be deconstructed for parts. Referring to itself as Murderbot, it settles in to provide security for the team with as little attention to the boring job paid as possible and hopefully much more time spent watching the entertainment feeds it has illegally downloaded. Unfortunately for Murderbot, when a neighboring survey team goes dark, it's up to Murderbot and the scientists to get to the truth before they fall victim to sabotage themselves. This is the first book I've read by Martha Wells but I'm definitely putting her on my to-read list for the foreseeable future. All Systems Red has a delightfully wry, dark sense of humor that instantly makes Murderbot an amusing (and appealing) protagonist who walks the line somewhere between HK-47 and R2D2. Murderbot is extremely sassy and has a distinctly pessimistic view of humans but starts to reluctantly come to like some of its team. The way that Wells writes the interactions between the half-human, half-machine android and the human team members both made me laugh and seemed somehow a remarkably accurate representation of human nature. It's easy to identify with Murderbot as it really just wants to be left alone to devour its entertainment feeds even as it keeps having to rescue the humans on the team. The mystery of the sabotage on the planet goes from strange anomalies to holy shit we've got to get out of here pretty quickly but the resolution was satisfying. I definitely want to see more of Murderbot on his future adventures. fic-sci-fi format-novellas owned-audible ...more 4 likes"}
{"username":"Jack","date":1505347200000,"review_text":"Well that was a fun little diversion. And by little, I mean LITTLE! This is, hands down, the shortest book I've read all year. And also probably the easiest read I've done all year. Given my penchant for reading large and\/or heady books, this one was pretty much a \"blink and you'll miss it\" deviation for me. It was also our book club pick following the behemoth that was Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, and we chose it because it was an easy read, which we felt was necessary after wading through the 1000+ pages of TWoK. So what did I think of All Systems Red? Well, it was...good. That's about the best I can come up with at the moment. I loved the idea of a rogue Security bot that hacked its own governor, stopped caring about the corporate mission, and decided to basically be a TV junkie. And the fact that it refers to itself as Murderbot was just priceless. But outside of those concepts, the story just didn't really move me like I hoped it would. Part if this is, I'm sure, due to the brevity of the tale. There's not a lot of room for character arcs or deep plotting in a story this short. And I get it...it's not supposed to be a monster story. This is popcorn entertainment, and it achieves that goal rather well. But, that being said, I still was left feeling a little cold after reading All Systems Red. Nobody really gets any backstory or context, the people in the tale are essentially just random people who are assigned various archetypes and behaviors to stand out. I never got much of a visual of any of them. As for Murderbot, while admired the snarky way in which it narrated its tale, I still wanted to know more about it, and this never really came to pass. Another thing that took away from my enjoyment is the way in which the narrative unfolds. I've read several books where the storytelling was...incidental at best. But All Systems Red takes the cake. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was just kind of half-explained or defined. From the action to the locations to the characters themselves, nothing is written in much detail. In fact, the action scenes were comprised mostly of passages that read something like \"I ran at it while shooting my projectile weapon. It was shooting at me at the same time. I got hit a few times, but I managed to find a vital area on my opponent and take it down.\" And...that's it. The problem with writing like this is it robs the story of any sense of drama or suspense. It's all so...casual. And that casual writing makes the narrative casual as well, which doesn't help to engage the reader as much. Because this is a short novella, we jump from sequence to sequence pretty quickly, but even on things that I felt should have been given more weight, Martha Wells just kinda glosses over them. Not having read any of her other works, I can't say if this is just how she writes, or if she had to constrain herself to keep the story short & sweet. Again, I wanted more. But it's not all bad! Murderbot is a fun narrator, and carries the first person POV tale quite well. I enjoyed the snark, the sarcasm, and the flippancy in which it viewed most situations it found itself in. I loved how anti-social Murderbot was, and how it really just wanted to be left alone to watch its video entertainment...aka soap operas. The overall concept is also rather cool, but I feel that this could have been far more impactful as either a full-length novel or a larger novella. I wanted more heft with my tale, and I never received that. But I can see the potential here, and given that this is the first in a series of books, I think Martha Wells can certainly take this character in interesting directions. The ending of this one opens up all sorts of possibilities, and I'd like to see what is next for Murderbot. 26 likes 1 comment"}

I absolutely adore Murderbot and I want to read more about him... his voice is just so hilarious, fascinating and authentic. And it is sort of adorable how he's so akward with humans. The plot was well structured. It wasn't that much predictable or unpredictable, but it did let you guess what's actually going on. What was unusual however, was that the role of the enemies wasn't that big - yes, they had an impact on the story and were a danger to our cutie - but they didn't really have proper presence. We know who and why, but that part wasn't relevant overall. Our Murderbot and his character were the focus, the book being from his POV, and what he wanted to do. Also, did I mention how hilarious and sweet that robot is? Seriously, I don't want to spoil any of these moments that still make me smile fondly, but just read it if you are a sucker of akward robots. Also, if you don't know whether you'll like akward robots. I'm almost sure you'll love Murderbot, he's that awesome of a character. Also, I've forgotten how well Martha Wells can write... I need to reread this one. As soon as I've forgot some parts of it. 144 pages or so are just too short! Next book? (Time travel to 2018! Damn.

{"username":"Johannes","date":1505520000000,"review_text":"I did not care for this book. Based on the book description it should have been right up my ally, but I was really disappointed. The book seems to get great reviews by other readers, however I don't think this is a true reflection of this book. I think that most readers either a) never finished the book, or b) simply did not want to waste another minute writing a review of the book. So my fellow readers, if you are considering this book please read this review as I think it will give you a more balanced view of the book. My biggest problem is the characters - And there are quite a few of them. The sad thing is, that I cant even tell you how many characters there are. I estimate that there are 6 - 10 characters in the book, but they are all so bland and frankly non-essential to the plot, that I could not tell them apart. You get little to no information about them other than a name and a team function. There are also some interpersonal relations between them, but again they do not matter for the plot at all. The plot itself is thin, and only works if you care about the characters, and since I didn't, the plot did not work for me at all. The world building is basically non-existent. Lots of references to other places and cultures, but no info on them. Its basically just all footnotes. I am not usually this harsh in my reviews, and always try to give the book the benefit of the doubt, but in this case I simply don't think this book is worth your time. If you are looking for a book in this style with a robot \/ cyborg as the protagonist, I would suggest you consider these books instead: - The Alchemy of Stone by Ekaterina Sedia - Cinder by Marissa Meyer (Love warning) Or if you are just looking for an awesome catheter driven sci-fi book please consider The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. One of my all-time favourite books. I hope this review was useful to you. 31 likes 5 comments"}

And that\u2019s a shame because what other reason than to bathe in the glorious carnage would a reader select a title like this . . . ? Murderbot, as it dubs itself, is assigned to the security detail of a scientific expedition on an alien world. Its main roles are to protect the scientists from unknown alien threats and to ensure the success of the mission. Part man part machine, it\u2019s designed to be entirely under the control of its clients. However, a malfunction in its programming has left it with free will\u2014a fact that it hides from its employers for fear of being decommissioned. As well as the fact that it\u2019s not the terrifying monster it appears to be. Underneath all that armor is one clever, quick-witted, and surprisingly sympathetic individual. On the surface, all appears to be copacetic, but in reality, it only puts in the bare minimum of effort so as to devote as much time as possible to binge its favorite shows from the entertainment feed. It\u2019s much more concerned about the fate of those fictional characters than its human masters. The only problem is there\u2019s a section missing from their map of the planet, and the other expedition is failing to respond to their inquiries. Sabotage seems to be afoot, and, sadly, Murderbot may have to pause its shows long enough to put in a real effort . . . This story was completely lacking in depth of character. In fact, some of the names were so challenging\u2014Bharadwaj, Volescu, Pin-Lee, Ratthi, Overse, Guarathin\u2014that it was difficult to even keep track of who\u2019s who, let alone their motivations. Even though the story was only a novella, I can\u2019t forgive the lack of character development or worldbuilding. Off the top of my head, I can think of three shorter stories that excelled at both\u2014Legion, Moot, and Defending Elysium. Although to be fair, the story was told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot who wasn\u2019t overly concerned about the fate of these civilians, so why should we be? \u201cYou don\u2019t know who we are? They didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d \u201cThere was an info packet in my initial download.\u201d I was still staring out at the heavy green tangle just past the rocks. I really didn\u2019t want to get into how little I paid attention to my job. \u201cI didn\u2019t read it.\u201d Arada said, gently, \u201cWhy not?\u201d With all of them staring at me, I couldn\u2019t come up with a good lie. \u201cI didn\u2019t care.\u201d Bottom line: Although the narrator was far from a gifted storyteller, the plot was decent enough. But as a heartless killing machine, the poor girl was a terrible failure.

{"username":"Acqua","date":1508630400000,"review_text":"For a book where the secondary characters were (deliberately?) really underdeveloped, I loved it a lot. It's about a SecUnit (a self-aware security droid) that calls itself \"Murderbot\" and has gone rogue - it has hacked its governor module to access the combined feed of entertainment channels (it's a bored rogue bot). Now it can act freely, but that doesn't mean it will leave the humans in danger. I loved reading in the Murderbot's PoV. I was afraid it would sound mechanical, but it didn't - and it was really entertaining. A shy, murderous droid. It works. I loved how this book avoided the \"AI falls in love and discovers they're more human than they thought\" trope - one of the many overused subtropes of \"romantic love makes us human\", which I hate (I'm looking at you, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, and also at you, Defy the Stars). Murderbot is not human. Murderbot doesn't want to be human. That means it doesn't necessarily want what the humans want, and that doesn't mean it's evil. Since Murderbot is not exactly what humans expect when they think about machines, there's a lot of awkwardness between it and the human crew - they do not know how to deal with a machine that looks like a human and almost acts like a human, but it's definitely not one. Most side characters are forgettable, but there is a side f\/f relationship and this is only a novella. Note: yes, the main character doesn't have a gender and is not interested in sex or romance, but I wouldn't recommend this book as \"aro\/ace\/agender representation\" - it's about a robot.

Probably my 4th time through these (even though I clearly say this is the 3rd above. I still have my doubts). Although - spoiler alert - I only went through this round because they were free with my Audible membership and I wanted to listen to them. I think I got to listen to maybe 4 before they started making me pay or use a credit. I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I\u2019ve purchased these multiple times already in different formats. I wrote a song (with a little help from A.I.) about the book. HERE IS MY SONG *Second read* This is, what, my fourth review in a week? Yeah, I\u2019m big-time now. Weirdly, I was mentioning sometime this week about how I\u2019d lay awake at night freaking out if I were to simply skip a book so I could review something else that interested me more. Skipping a book. Insane. I was curious as to why when I told Goodreads I was reading this particular book \u2013 the first in the series - it didn\u2019t bring up my old review. I figured it must be because I read it the first time as a trade edition, not a kindle edition. So I didn\u2019t think about it. But then I decided to look and see what I wrote about this book last time I read, nothing better, after all, than popping open my brain from a few years ago to see what was going on inside, and lo and behold, there was no review. I\u2019d skipped a book. My world crashed down upon me. I mean, am I in trouble? Are the review cops coming to haul me away? Am I getting kicked out the brotherhood? Would my family still love me? So many things have gonetopsy turvy. Regardless, I picked up the pieces and decided not to contemplate my darker thoughts and instead focus on the positives. I got an email from my old boss at my former job, he let me know that they\u2019ve been struggling for the past 9 plus months since I left (not to bring the real world into things, but I adore all my former co-workers, and wish them well and like to think we\u2019ll always be friends), so that made me feel better. I mean, they miss me there. So, yeah, I may have failed, but I\u2019m not a total loser. But if I had written a review of the book when I first read it, just after came out, I imagine it would have gone something like this: Wow, it\u2019s 2017. Work has been crazy, putting in long hours, barely have time to read. But this book was great. Wish it were longer. Also, what\u2019s the deal with my kids? Blah blah blah. I hate boring things.\u201d Wow. In case you were wondering, I didn\u2019t just pull that from a time machine, which I invented and have used not to enrich myself, or to alter history for the better, but instead to ask myself my thoughts on books I\u2019ve read, and still remember,sorta, in order to get a slightly different take on it since I just re-read said books. Yep, none of that happened. So not even worth mentioning. But the older, wiser, more sophisticated me has a unique take on this, the very first of theMurderbot books. Yes, it was good, and yes, I do wish it were longer, and yes, work, and yes my kid! And yes, still have strong opinions about boring things. But also, as an islander now, I have to ask, what\u2019s the deal with all the water? No, that\u2019s not it. I forgot, all that typing as set up and it slipped my mind. Needless to say, I had a hot take that was awesome, and insightful. The world is poorer for not having read about it. *first read* this is a review I could not find anywhere when I looked for it multiple times this week and which sorta invalidates the whole second read review I put up. Stupid computers Several years ago, I dunno, maybe five, I wrote a story about a killbot and an old man taking on the world together. I haven\u2019t reread that story since I published it myself all those many years ago. Memory is a great thing, because it lets you rewrite the past into a narrative that makes sense to you now. So, my award-winning (That\u2019s a made-up memory) story was the inspiration for this amazing book I just finished (also made-up fact) about a murderbot and its small band of buddies taking on the world together. Yes, both are works of genius (thanks memory, never let me change my opinion of my old story), and mine was about a \u2018killbot\u2019 while this one was about a \u2018murderbot,\u2019 but beyond that, I think it shows that the world is big enough to two works exploring a theme. I mean, the 90\u2019s brought us Deep Impact and Armageddon in the same year. It gave us Dante\u2019s Peak and Volcano, heck, it even gave us A Bug\u2019s Life and Antz. So I say, let the second decade of the 21st century let us have My Killbot Buddy and The Murderbot Diaries. For the curious, my story, best I can tell, hasn\u2019t sold a copy in a few years. I don\u2019t know where that puts me on the bestseller lists, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s outside the top 10. However, I\u2019m pretty sure it could be worse. I don\u2019t know how it could be worse, but I\u2019m sure if I thought about it for a few minutes I could come up with something.* So the plot of this tale is basically that a murderbot with a heart of gold (that\u2019s a metaphor, I\u2019m sure its actual heart is made of other precious metals\u2026 and maybe some space-age plastics or ceramics\u2026 wait, do robots have hearts?) and a real penchant for watching TV finds itself bonding with the people it has been programmed to protect, as they realize they\u2019re being targeted for murder on an alien world with no way to call for help. This is possibly the shortest novel I\u2019ve ever read. I have no idea what the word count was, but I\u2019d guess it was 40k or so. I mean, that\u2019s pretty short. I think reading it over an hour or two is not unlikely. I think it was 150 pages, give or take, in the paper book I had. Big font with big margins too. It was pretty short. But I don\u2019t feel gyped. It was also really good. The main character is the murderbot, and I loved it. It had motivations and actions that were very human, but also not. It was a great mix of strange and familiar that I wish I could read more of. Alas, I look at my tbr pile and it\u2019s almost entirely books on religion. Sigh. I\u2019m never going to get away from doing my homework on God\/gods\/no-gods and how they\/it feels, acts, and thinks. This book was a great break from all that. I\u2019m going to try to get a better mix of stuff going forward. I can imagine looking back at my Goodreads feed for the past couple of years (and the next few) and think I really wasted my time. As my good friend told me one morning when she saw me reading a religious book at a table in a hotel restaurant, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find the truth about God by looking for him in a book.\u201d To which I responded, \u201cShut up! I\u2019m not crying. You are!\u201d** Boom. Argument settled. I win. I mean, it doesn\u2019t appear that way based on what I wrote above, but with the healing power of memory, I\u2019m pretty sure in a few years I will replace that conversation with one that will have me giving a polemic that receives a standing ovation from the others listening in from the muffin bar while my questioner shares a weepy repent for their hubris in questioning me. Whoa, I jumped ship for a minute. Sorry about that. What was I talking about? In conclusion, I highly recommend my short story which you can find at\u2026 wait, I mean, I highly recommend this short novel, titled, All Systems Red and if you\u2019re into this sort of SF (kind of like the Ancillary related books by Ann Leckie) then it\u2019s your loss in not reading. *Got it, the writer of this excellent story, finding my story so compelling and amazing, decides that it can\u2019t be allowed to exist, and sues me for proactive copyright infringement, and I\u2019m forced to pull my story down and pay fines related to my infringement. **This is true in the way that those \u2018based on a true story\u2019 lines you see at the beginning of paranormal activity movies are true. Meaning, in reality, I was asked this question, and my response was a polemic that, once completed, resulted in a standing ovation from the others in the breakfast bar...

Mensah was particularly well done. I hope the author didn't name her to make us think she's extra-intelligent.

I wish I could give you a well-considered reason for this, but I'm not sure I can produce one. It seemed like the plot took over and that was a lot less interesting than this fantastic, lazy Murderbot whose character, musings, and awkward interactions with humans Wells delights us with in the previous 2\/3 of the book. It's not that the plot doesn't start until the last 1\/3, but that the last 1\/3 feels like a perfunctory going through the motions, like just filling in the blanks for the explanations needed. Murderbot has hacked his governor module, which means he no longer has to follow his programming and his more organic\/human elements influence his thinking. He's kind of like a teenager who basically just wants to watch TV. He's pretty damn funny and rather endearing. And he's all too human: \"I don't know what I want... But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.\" I am looking forward to the next book in the series. Wells sets up a fascinating world with a wide range of human-machine life forms and interactions, as well as cost-cutting corporate-control at every turn.

This is a diary of a robot (or maybe it is actually half robot-half human, because it has organic parts?) who kept grumbling about everything. All it wanted was that people leave it alone. It maintained security for a group of human scientists, and it expected them to let it does its things (for example, binge-watching TV series it downloaded in secret). It hacked its (governor) module to be free from any commands from its center\/company. So, basically it's a free agent with its own will and (lack of) motivation. Which made it become more humane than it was aware of, even if it calls itself a murderbot. A hilarious murderbot. Aaaaah, a robot with conscience. I love the idea already. I like it so much I am shocked to see that the Kindle version only lasts for 150-something pages.

{"username":"Evelina | AvalinahsBooks","date":1521158400000,"review_text":"I had heard all sorts of wonderful things about All Systems Red before I picked it up (I have a lot of Goodreads friends who know their stuff when it comes to sci-fi! Yes, I'm looking at you, Caro M.) Now I trust their recommendations even more, because this book is easily my best February read. You can read the post with better formatting here on my blog. 5 Reasons To Read All Systems Red \"Murderbot\" is a jailbroken security android (cyborg? Well, you know.) Basically, SecUnits (as they're called) function as remotely controlled synthetic human slaves, basically, and they don't get a say in any of what they're doing, which is mostly murdering hostiles and getting mashed in the process. Murderbot though, a name it has sarcastically given itself (and will be henceforth referred to as 'them' in this review), have jailbroken themselves and would rather just watch hours and hours of sci-fi soaps than interact with humans, who actually give them anxiety fits. Murderbot is incredibly introverted, you see. But in order to not disclose a) having a mind b) having free will c) their predilection towards sci-fi soap operas, Murderbot still has to do their job. Which is how they end up on a ship with a crew they actually don't hate, but... on a mission nobody should be on. Hint: it's a mission that is kind of hard to survive, and it's clearly rigged. Reason #1. Murderbot Is More Human Than The Actual Humans Murderbot comes across as an incredibly introverted personality who is empathetic like any other human being (maybe more so?), but shy of it and trying to hide it even from their own self. Seeing them turn to face the corner when talking to humans or panic while trying not to have their fave scrunch up into a mask of despair when being spoken to was incredibly amusing - and not in a mean way. Murderbot's shyness is SO relatable! You will love this character to bits. I know I did. Reason #2. It's Like A Doctor Who Episode With David Tennant For any Doctor Who fans, this book is like a good episode from the Tennant days \u2013 a hostile planet pretending to be neutral, and things slowly get worse and worse and he crew has to figure out what is up. It's just so good! My interest didn't drop even once, while reading this. And I realized how much I miss a good Doctor Who episode from the old days. (Well... the \"newer old days\"!) I thought this was topical on the whole #FEELS topic. Ha. Topic. Topical. (Don't hit me.) Reason #3. The Virtues This book has incredibly good virtues and such an amazing moral atmosphere. And it's presented in such a self-deprecating manner as well (Shruti, you must read this!) Murderbot is willing to throw themselves in danger to protect the ones they care about, even though they're aware humans are not really supposed to care \"back\". It's really touching how Murderbot calls them \"my humans\". I would say Murderbot is a true sci-fi knight. Reason #4. Murderbot's Gender Or Lack Thereof Well, this is going to be hard to formulate. So, have you ever felt underrepresented? If you're a woman, you most likely have. Because we've got like maybe 2 heroes who jump in and save the day. Other than that, guys always do all the saving. Murderbot though? They don't really have a gender (and are often referred to as \u2018it' in the book, but I refuse - Murderbot has too much personality for that!) Anyway, despite probably looking like Terminator, Murderbot is not referred to as male - which is why I found myself imagining them more female than male by the middle of the book! I was surprised, but I figure it comes from wanting to see myself represented as able to do stuff, you know? And Murderbot I'd a character that lets you do that. It's pretty great. Reason #5. It's Just So Funny! So maybe this should have been the number one reason. This book will keep you laughing throughout the entire time you're reading it, I mean, when you're not having #feels. The manner it is written, and especially the manner Murderbot talks in is just priceless. I can't wait for further installments of The Murderbot diaries! Other Books You Might Like I wish I could recommend you more books like that! But such gems are not common. And I would be very happy if you recommended me something similar. Meanwhile, I can only think of two books that fit the style \u2013 in terms of humor, at least. Redshirts has the same kind of \"I can't stop laughing\" thing going on, and also shares some moments of poignancy by the end. It's also impossible to put down. As for The Martian, some of the topics might be unrelated at all, but the main character is similar to Murderbot \u2013 very resourcefull, brave and has the same vein of humor in the way he talks. It's also written in first person. I enjoyed both of these a lot! Read Post on My Blog | My Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter books-of-2018 favorites fiction ...more 43 likes 8 comments"}

That's the premise of All Systems Red, where self-stylized Murderbot (think Abed Nadir with some mechanical parts), having achieved sentience, desires nothing more than to be left alone and watch TV for the remainder of it's existence. However, the same culture of complacency and corruption in the ubiquitous parent company company which allowed Murderbot to break free of it's robotic fetters enable a mysterious enemy to interfere with Murderbot's carefully laid lack of plans.

What would happen if humans lost that control? For a novella just around 150 pages, this book read like a much longer book...in a good way.

I just read System Collapse (Murderbot #7), had a lot of fun and decided that it is finally time for a re-read of the entire series. Wow, I didn\u2018t remember that the plot was so dramatic! I had forgotten most of it. And I had also forgotten that so many of the characters showing up in later novellas were here already. I also didn\u2018t recall the quieter scenes. Maybe it needs a re-read to pick up those details. Not trying to assign a gender to Murderbot anymore. I am probably also sadder about its horrible circumstances and the choices it has to make to protect its humans. Moving along to Artificial Condition. This is great comfort reading. +*+*+ Review from October 2017: This was fun, especially the inner monologue of our Murderbot. In just 160 pages the author managed to build a believable world with lively and varied characters and an entertaining plot. This is a winner! \"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\" That could be me on any given day. Lots of potential. Is Murderbot a real person or not? The awkwardness of the crew, trying to figure out the correct way of interacting with Murderbot, once they realized that perhaps there is a person behind that opaque faceplate, was pretty priceless. And Murderbot's horror at their attempts to interact! Talking to the humans! And feelings, oh no! I tried not to assign a gender to Murderbot. I don't want to use \"it\" as a personal pronoun. I am leaning towards using \"him\", not quite sure why. Well, actually, because I pictured him as the android in the Prometheus movies, aka Michael Fassbender.

{"username":"Stephanie","date":1508544000000,"review_text":"WHY?: A LOT of love out there for this novella, it sounded fun and I need some quicker reads to catch up to my reading goal for the year. SYNOPSIS: Self-monikered Murderbot, is a security AI assigned to protect a group of scientists looking for usable resources on an unexplored planet. Murderbot has long ago hacked its governor chip, meaning it has free will, but it must keep this fact hidden or risk being dismantled, or worse, become a mindless drone again for The Company. When things go wrong on the expedition, however, Murderbot finds it harder and harder to stay hidden and still keep the humans safe. My affection for stories about Artificial Intelligence was firmly established a few years ago when I re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation and found that Data has become my favorite character. Or maybe it goes all the way back to my teenage years when I unexpectedly fell in love with Terminator 2 which I saw 7 times in the movie theater (I happened to work at a theater at the time so it's not that impressive...or geeky - Much). I think I really enjoy the scope stories abut AIs give to ask big questions like...what does it mean to be human?...what is life?...what constitutes sentience?... but in a way that is more entertaining and less stuffy than reading a philosophy text book. And that's the main reason you should read All Systems Red - it's hugely entertaining! Murderbot is one of the best characters I've read all year. The very vision of a bored, apathetic, socially awkward corporate worker who can't wait to get off and lose itself in the thousands of hours of entertainment serials it can download. It has a wicked, sardonic sense of humor and cynical outlook on life that was a beauty to behold and often made me laugh out loud. We've mostly all been there and had to try to hide that negative, shy, pathetic side of ourselves. The difference with Murderbot is that it's a made thing out of a blend of organic and inorganic materials and it is not supposed to have a personality. It's also not supposed to care about the humans it is guarding but even though it is inclined not to, it does, because they are a nice, intelligent, tight knit group of friends that don't make Murderbot do horrible or humiliating things. Against its will, it develops an affection for them or, at least, doesn't want to see them die. The story is also fast-paced and a lot of fun being part mystery, part sci-fi thriller and part action-adventure. Given that this is a novella and only has a limited page count, Wells does an admirable job telling a well-rounded, satisfying and complete story that also left me wanting more and excited that this is book one in a series. You can probably thank Murderbot for me wanting more! The society and and context of the \"Sec Units\" in the universe is also well established, which is again really impressive for such a short book especially since the world-building is well-integrated into the plot and does not slow the pace down one bit.

{"username":"nikki","date":1511740800000,"review_text":"cross posted from fox and fiction. Oh boy do I love a good artificial intelligence\/robot book. All Systems Red delivers exactly the kind of thing I want to see in a book told through a robot's eyes, in a tight little novella. Murderbot is a security bot, who has hacked itself and overridden its security protocols, partly so it can make judgment calls on its orders, and partly so it can watch countless hours of TV. When the research expedition Murderbot is working for starts having problems much bigger than the brochure advertised, things get interesting. The book is very short so I don't want to talk too much about the plot, but Wells keeps things comprehensible and entertaining, all while touching on many of the interesting questions that come up when we talk about artificial intelligence. What makes someone a human, what makes someone a being? I think the argument of whether something non-biological can have sapience really brings up more questions on what it means to be human than what it means to be robot. And when it's well done, it's fascinating, it's compelling, and it's great fun to read. Murderbot is also a very lovable character, which might be surprising for a being that calls itself 'Murderbot'. But being broken and flawed and terrible at social interaction give this robot more character, illicits more sympathy, than many human characters manage to. All Systems Red also manages to contain a story that feels complete in itself, while still setting up for future books. Which is fantastic, because I love Murderbot, and would gladly read only about Murderbot for as much as I can. artificial-intelligence novella own-ebook ...more"}

{"username":"Philip","date":1591488000000,"review_text":"3ish stars. Some heavy themes wrapped up in what is otherwise a relatively fluffy novella. The plot's straight-forward, the prose is decent, and it's charming and witty. Murderbot, who repeatedly says that she'd rather be netflixing, is surprisingly relatable. One of my favorite parts is when Murderbot is faced with the prospect of spending time with people and is (understandably) horrified. She can't control her facial reaction which in turn makes the human crew she's assigned to uncomfortable to know that they're making Murderbot uncomfortable (and that she has feelings as human as any of them). Also, I've just realized that I've been using female pronouns for Murderbot, when Murderbot is actually genderless and is referred to as 'it' by the crew. For some reason I naturally thought of Murderbot as being female and I'm not sure why, maybe because the author is a woman?

{"username":"Michael Lever","date":1676764800000,"review_text":"My sheer delight in this book was tempered by only one factor -the same reason I haven't given the book a 5. All Systems Red is less than 150 small pages long. Barely an evenings read. Otherwise, this work is simply magnificent. By the end, I realised that although I have been reading AI and robot scifi for over 40 years, starting with my total immersion in I Robot by Asimov - that nevertheless I have never been brought to empathise as closely with a Bot as is achieved here. And perhaps (although resented by me) the brevity is an artform in itself, as the author manages to construct and bring to credible close, worlds, characters and plausible story without ever seeming to rush, yet keeping the pages turning. The downside is, no library I've found holds this series, and I'm hooked, but loath to fork out $20 a pop for each of the (6?) subsequent, cheaply bound paperbacks. The books are by TOR, and are very lightly bound in soft cover. I wonder if this and the book length is an intentional strategy to tap into the collectible zine market? Hmmm."}

So often, books portray AI or robots as evil masterminds, who only want to exterminate human life. This bot is the complete opposite: all he wants to do is catch up on his favourite soap operas. A murderbot after my own heart. This book was just so funny and had such a great concept. Will definitely keep reading the series."}
{"username":"Eesh","date":1628812800000,"review_text":"Reread Update: Yeah, loved it the second time as well. Muderbot is such a great protagonists. And I feel like I was unnecessarily critical of the world-building last time. There's nothing wrong with it, we just don't get a lot because this is a short book focused on making sure we get to know Muderbot well, which we do. I'm excited to finally continue the series. ********************************************* I was pleasantly surprised by this novella. Even though the synopsis sounded really cool, I didn't have many expectations. It's about a robot, but since it also has organic parts, I'm thinking more of a cyborg. But that's beside the point. The protagonist, and narrator, refers to itself as Murderbot. It's managed to hack into its system and sever the part which makes it obligated to obey the company that created it. The first line of the novella is this: I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. I mean, how awesome is that? Anyone who decides to forgo mass murder because there are so many book and TV shows to watch... that's my kind of person. Then there's the fact that it genuinely does not give a fuck about anyone. It just wants to watch the shows and be left alone. It only does a half-assed job whenever it's assigned to accompany a team of employers for their survey on a planet, acting as monitor and security. This time, there's another team, people who actually seem nice. Not that it cares. It usually avoids people. But then stuff starts to go wrong and our beloved Murderbot may be the only chance of the team's survival. It's a good plot. And the side characters are likable. I especially liked the team leader and the one guy who didn't like our\u00a0Murderbot. The world building could use work. I still can't get a clear picture of what kind of world the novella is set in. If it weren't for the protagonist being as brilliant as it is, the novella wouldn't have been as good. Back to Murderbot. I love this it. In fact, I have a couple more quotes from the novella. \"Are you all right?\" That was too much attention. I turned around and walked into the corner, facing away from them. I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked the real ones, but you can't have one without the other. How could you not love it?! I can't wait to see where it will go next, especially after that ending, which I also loved. I highly recommend this novella, if only just so you can get to know Murderbot. 2017-reads the-great-short 2 likes"}
{"username":"Celtic","date":1689033600000,"review_text":"Something billed as Murderbot is exactly the kind of thing I usually avoid, but it's clear from the opening para that this is a different type of book - \"As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\" I did enjoy it, and there's a lot to like, but it loses a star from me as I thought it was building up nicely but the ending felt rushed and, as a result, unsatisfactory. I'll say no more, because of spoilers, but I suspect you'll know what I mean if you've read it. Still, a very promising start and I'll happily read more. A re-read a couple of years later confirmed those impressions - loved it, right up to a rather abrupt end. Though the end itself is very good - stoking the desire for more Murderbot.

But even beyond Murderbot's personality which was so amusing to read, watching Murderbot figure out what it wants to do with its life is interesting.

This first \"Murderbot\" novella is therefore a working hard-boiled story. Someone has slaughtered the scientists at one planetary survey base, and the inhabitants of the other, with their security robot (aka the titular Murderbot), have to figure out who and why, while also trying to stay alive. Murderbot's unexpected musings on humanity, the society that created him, and the nature of free will provide the philosophical and thematic base of the story, but this is a locked-room (or base) mystery with a corking good supporting cast and a suspenseful ending. It bodes well for the rest of the series. 7 likes"}

{"username":"Thomas","date":1507852800000,"review_text":"Meet Murderbot. Murderbot is a half-robot, half-organic construct that's been hired to assist an excavation crew doing a survey on a new planet. Murderbot has disabled the governor in itself, allowing it to do such things as ignore direct orders, skip scheduled upgrades, and not follow its own directives. In short, Murderbot has become a sentient entity without any restraints. Luckily, \"Murderbot\" doesn't accurately describe itself. This novella is an intriguing look at human\/robot relations, as told from the perspective of the robot. There may be more to Murderbot's organic side than this story lets on (it doesn't have complete recall on some events that happened in its past), but the way the story is told, it feels like it's more robot than organic. That being said, this is the first in a series of novellas, so maybe that's something we'll learn in a future volume. Regardless, Murderbot has an empathetic side, as well as other emotions that her human co-workers didn't expect to see. I'm a reader of the webcomic\u00a0Questionable Content, and as I was reading this story, I kept picturing Bubbles as Murderbot. As such, it made me envision Murberbot as female, even though there's nothing in the story to support it. Due to that connection, or possibly to the fact that the author is female, Murderbot felt female to me throughout the story. I don't know if other readers got that feeling out of the story; I'd be curious to know. The story is set in a science-fictional world, but at its heart, it's a mystery. The story opens part of the way into the excavation, and we learn that a good chunk of their information has gone missing from their files. At that point, the characters have to learn who's behind the sabotage, before things turn deadly. The structure of the story feels like a whodunnit, and I see one other review has labeled it as a hard-boiled story, which I get, though I don't necessarily agree. Either way, this is a sharp story with an engaging narrator and likable supporting characters. It doesn't quite reach the four-star level with me, but that's likely due to having high expectations going into the story.\u00a0All Systems Red is getting tremendous hype, not unjustly, but I was expecting something a bit more wowie-zowie out of it based on it all. I'll definitely read the rest of the series, though. 2017 e-book mystery ...more"}

{"username":"Stephen","date":1507766400000,"review_text":"Enjoyable sci-fi read. Liked Murderbot, the too human cyborg at the center of this drama. A very original character. Built to be a robotic security agent, he has hacked his system to allow freewill, only to find he really doesn't care to do much besides watching serial TV shows. When called on to protect his clients, he initially does so more because it's his job and he'd feel stupid watching videos instead than any order or commitment. As he gets to know his clients he finds he's more invested in their well being than expected and goes to great lengths to protect them Liked the supporting characters, setting and drama built in the earlier parts of the story. That drama unfortunately fizzles in the the big reveal when the villain turns out to be a not to clever bureaucrat vs someone truly villainous. How dumb is this guy? He's knows when he meets Murderbot on the plateau outside GrayCris' camp that Murderbot has somehow protected and hidden his clients and killed or disabled three SecUnits left behind at the DeltFall camp with no apparent injury to himself. Murderbot is therefore smart and exceedingly dangerous. Murderbot tells him that he has no governor and therefore operates with free will. Message: Everything Murderbot has done was done by choice vs order or programming. He's unlikely to trust anything the person trying to kill him promises. Yet Blue assumes that he will follow his order to retrieve Mensah based on a weak promise and sends only one SecUnit to kill him.. What could have been an epic battle of wits and firepower to escape the planet never happens. The final pages are also completely out of character. Murderbot doesn't really like people and has no idea what he wants to do but in the space a single page hatches a completely random plan to leave those who care about him behind in favor of hopping a ride on a random ship and life where he is almost certain to have to deal with complete strangers. I understand setting up for a sequel but this could have been done with more elegance in line with the Murderbot character established throughout the rest of the book. So, 3 stars instead of 4 due to a weak ending, but still a recommended read. 6 likes 1 comment"}
{"username":"Jerry Jose","date":1507852800000,"review_text":"Do Androids dream of electric sheep? Our half droid here sure loves TV series. Martha Wells\u2019 \u2018The Murderbot Diaries\u2019 can be compared with Nnedi Okorafor\u2019s \u2018Binti\u2019 in narrative style: first person accord through a marginalized character, in a serialized story, structured through novellas. I didn\u2019t go well with \u2018Binti\u2019, but, \u2018All Systems Red\u2019 hit all the right spots. It was refreshingly short, minimal in execution, well fleshed and lively, despite its premise where, literally, all systems were red. Protagonist is a security bot -half android and half human, like a cyborg, and from the story it can be inferred that this futuristic society has co-existence of humans, bots and special purpose half bots. Interestingly and also a bit disturbingly, the murderbot is never assigned a gender or a name, and is almost treated as a property by the expedition team than an individual, thanks to the universal SecUnit armour that covers everything organic and metallic. Author doesn\u2019t treat this as an existential problem, as the Murderbot itself is content with strict work interactions. As I progressed further in the story, I started to identify myself with the Meursault like SecUnit than its human companions. Its shy, prefers face and expressions hidden under visor, and escapes loneliness by watching television series. Murderbots have a governing module as per job purpose, and their decision making is strictly through game theory probabilities, but the organic parts make it constantly self-aware during the process. Even now I am feeling a little discomfort in addressing Murderbot as Murderbot or it. Turns out Shakespeare was wrong; there is a lot in a name. Though boasted as Westworld and Culture in bio, I was more or less reminded of Halo and Master Chief during the read. Anyway, this book is a prime example of how fun and uplifting reading could be, and I am more than eager to enter the next installment. 10 likes 2 comments"}

{"username":"Dennis","date":1618099200000,"review_text":"2021 reread: This was just what the doctor ordered. A planetary survey crew's Security 'droid has secretly hacked its governor module, but instead of killing the humans it just wants to be left alone and watch media. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\u2019t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. When there are signs that the mission had been sabotaged, however, and the neighboring mission goes dark it has to help its humans to figure out what is happening. This novella's strengths are its relentless pace and its unique main character. Murderbot is a non-binary half bot \/ half human construct, that is painfully shy and is still figuring out its own personality, while initially trying to pretend that it is just a SecUnit that is following orders. Turns out its humans are really nice, though, which only makes matters worse, because now there might be other reasons to actually try to keep them alive, apart from it looking bad on Murderbot's record if it fails to do so. Murderbot, however, feels far more comfortable with the fictional characters of its favorite soap opera than it does with being around real people. While the awkward interactions between Murderbot and the rest of the crew are rather sweet, the rogue SecUnit's inner monologue is often extremely funny. It is snarky, a little grumpy, sarcastic. But under its armor Murderbot is a little softie. A softie with build-in weaponry. Gurathin turned to me. \"So you don't have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.\" I looked at him. \"Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.\u201d Which comes in handy (the guns - not being a softie) when the shit hits the fan. All the while this little book also has some interesting things to say about free will, human treatment of androids and about being an introvert. It is a quick read that is fun and streamlined, but not shallow. Not when it comes to its very special and not at all heartless main character. ****** The drivel formerly known as my review: Winner of the 2017 Nebula Award and 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novella ____________________________ Unfortunately I've not done a proper review after reading this back in 2017.

Somehow, maybe because of the brevity, it manages to work, coming across as Murderbot telling its story to the reader.

{"username":"Ian Casey","date":1508803200000,"review_text":"I've come to expect quality from Tor's novella program, and Martha Wells' All Systems Red doesn't disappoint. Being the first of a trilogy (as with Binti), I was expecting an introduction to the world and characters without much in the way of closure. That is essentially what I got, although she was still able to conduct a neatly contained story arc over this book while so doing. This is the story of Murderbot, a cyborg killing machine whose human individuality and ingenuity is strong enough to break the shackles of her computer programmed command system and artificial body parts. She's hired out as security to anyone who needs some muscle. In this case, that's an interplanetary science exploration expedition where something is, of course, badly amiss. Let's just say a few too many people wore their red shirts that day. It's entertaining stuff that finds a good balance between serious and fluffy, maintaining the focus on character without bogging down in hard sci-fi chin-stroking. I found it reminiscent of Linda Ngata's 'The Red', which contemplated similar wirelessly networked cyborg killer technology though in a direct military context. I will definitely be awaiting book two. 1 like"}

{"username":"Jay Batson","date":1530835200000,"review_text":"I don't give many 5-star reviews, because my rating rules set the bar pretty high. This book deserves the top rating; it was both good and fun. And as a novella, it's a useful book-length to use to explore an interesting idea: What is the perspective of an AI (contained in a robot) that is part of a human team in a difficult situation where the AIs training and interests might diverge from the human's? You learn in the first paragraph that the AI should have a constraining governor in it that keeps it from having human-level attachments & feelings, but which is non-functional during the episode of the book. The AI was built to be a killing machine, but forcibly constrained (\"covered\") to be in the service of humans. When the governor doesn't work, will such an AI be nice to us? This is a question that is \"in the air\" in popular culture now because of the rapid advancement of AI capabilities and HW\/SW. This book doesn't have a deep intellectual exploration of the possibilities, the way academic (or popular non-fictional) treatments do. Instead, the author\/story takes a position, and lets the story emerge. The story itself is interesting, fast-paced, and very well written by a competent author. And, frankly, it's fun. Because the book is so short, I'm seriously tempted to re-read it just because of the joy I had reading it. Online scuttlebutt says this will become part of a series, or a further-developed story. I can't wait to read more. 1 like"}

But what the Company don't know is that Murderbot has hacked its governor module and is free to do whatever it pleases. Happily for its clients, what Murderbot pleases is mostly watching soap operas and snarking to itself about the humans in its protection, rather than committing mass murder. Martha Wells's novella, the first in a projected series of novellas about Murderbot from Tor (who seem to be very into the novella series as a format) is an enjoyable light read. Murderbot's snarky tone is engaging and entertaining and its social awkwardness makes it a surprisingly relatable character, while alongside a fairly straightforward plot the novella asks questions about artificial intelligence and the nature of personhood (not that Murderbot cares about this, it just wants to be left in peace to watch TV).

Then it disappeared into the TBR. It was recently re-mentioned on the Galactic Suburbia podcast and it bounced back onto my radar. This is just as awesome as everyone said it was. Murderbot itself is a really awesome characters from the get go, and yet it clearly also has a long way to go to discover just exactly what kind of person it can be, wants to be and - hopefully - will ultimately choose to be. To build that much character into a part organic\/part machine creature that hasn't ever stopped to think about anything beyond its basic programming, all in a novella, is an achievement to be applauded and Martha Wells has stepped up to the challenge. I have already pre-ordered the sequels that are coming out next year and I am determined not to let them sink into the bottomless abyss of the TBR stack this time. 2017 2025 9-out-of-10 ...more 4 likes"}

It ain't memorizing forty seven star systems and tech that makes you scratch your head and agonize over how dim you may or may not be. Yeah, I'm dim.... This is about an android who has hacked its governor module and no longer has to follow company orders or any other orders, even from humans. It goes along with a group called Preservation to check out things on a new planet. The android calls itself Murderbot for reasons obvious only deeper in the story. It is a security unit and it serves and protects its human charges. It is a very unique unit, having feelings and emotions that it is developing that it simply doesn't understand. The team finds itself in quite a mess when a rival company introduces kill modules on its androids and murders a nearby company's camp and outpost. Preservation finds this and concludes with their android's help that the people were killed by androids. The story gets deeper and there are many things left to say but this is a book needs reading and suffice it to say that the Murderbot is what is front and center here, and the way it imprints on its human charges. What is also refreshing is the way the humans react and act toward the android and see to its future. This book was a quick read and yet fulfilling and satisfying. This was well written and I will soon enjoy the author's further offerings. Well done! Danny 2 likes"}

The first line reads: \"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feeds of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.\" Along with the charming narration and an interesting plot, there are also some deeper themes going on surrounding agency and the\u00a0contradiction inherent in people wanting to help those with less agency but also having their own expectations surrounding what should then be done with that help which I think helped to elevated it above a fluff read.

It hacks into its own firmware and bypasses those controls that tie it to servitude to humans. But instead of going off the rails--as robots predictably do in so many sci fi novels--it instead becomes more human. The story held my interest all the way through, until the final chapter, which came across as a sort of afterthought, an addendum to the \"real\" story, and something I thought wasn't really necessary. It felt rushed and forced, but it did set the story up for a sequel, or a series. Still, I feel it could have been accomplished earlier in the story.

{"username":"Mogsy","date":1510099200000,"review_text":"4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https:\/\/bibliosanctum.com\/2017\/11\/07\/... Reading Martha Wells is always such a delight, but All Systems Red seemed like such a departure from her usual projects so I had no idea what to expect. As it turned out though, this little novella was a real treat. Told from the point of a view of a rogue SecUnit\u2014a part organic, part synthetic android designed to provide humans with protection and security services\u2014this story takes readers on a journey to a distant planet being explored by team of scientists. Accompanying them is our protagonist, a self-proclaimed \u201cMurderbot\u201d, whose presence is required by the Company sponsoring the mission. Thing is though, Murderbot doesn\u2019t exactly feel warm and fuzzy towards humans, and it knows that the scientists aren\u2019t too comfortable with having a SecUnit on the team either, given the cagey way they get whenever it\u2019s around. Still, that\u2019s just fine for Murderbot. Having hacked its own governor so that it doesn\u2019t have to follow Company directives, all it wants is to be left alone to enjoy the thousands of hours of entertainment vids that it has downloaded from the humans\u2019 satellites. Of course, no one can suspect that Murderbot is secretly autonomous, so it still has to go about its job like everything is normal, and this arrangement was working out just fine until one day, a routine surface test goes seriously wrong. Murderbot ends up saving the day, earning the admiration and curiosity of the team leader, Dr. Mensah. Soon, Murderbot is left with no choice but to take the lead in defending the scientists, when disaster strikes another neighboring expedition on the planet and threatens to come after them next. Having read a few of the author\u2019s Raksura novels, I was already familiar with her penchant for throwing readers into the thick of things, leaving them to gradually feel everything out for themselves. Thus I was unsurprised with the way this story opened\u2014by unceremoniously dropping us into Murderbot\u2019s head with hardly any context and minimal background information given. It takes a while to even grasp the kind of protagonist Murderbot is: an artificial entity, albeit a very sentient and self-aware one, complete with personality quirks and a dry sense of humor. While I\u2019ve read plenty of books starring robot protagonists, I can honestly say I\u2019ve never met one quite as unique and interesting as Murderbot. Martha Wells may be tight-fisted when it comes to the details, but she knows exactly how to get your attention. Everything from Murderbot\u2019s anti-social tendencies to its love of cheesy soap operas made me want to keep reading to discover more about the character and why it is telling this story. At just a little under 150 pages though, and with so much ground to cover, there\u2019s not much opportunity to stop and take a breath. As much as I loved how this book was so snappy and fast-paced, you do have to find your footing quickly or risk getting left behind. This means learning and familiarizing yourself with the characters as soon as they\u2019re introduced, and most of them, like the humans on the science team, are only going to be lightly sketched. This was probably my only criticism; considering how over time, Murderbot comes to see the team as \u201cits humans\u201d and become very protective of them, it would have been helpful to develop those characters a bit more, especially since our protagonist begins this tale by being very disdainful of them. Still, there wasn\u2019t much else I didn\u2019t enjoy about this book. It was entertaining, and more importantly, it also felt complete to me, unlike a lot of novellas that leave me wanting more. Plus, this snarky first-person narrative style is quite different from what I\u2019m used to when it comes to Wells, but I think I could grow to like it! Murderbot\u2019s narration was a joy to follow, and I even found myself chuckling at many of the story\u2019s scenes. Overall, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and I definitely would not hesitate recommending All Systems Red to anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix with a fun and captivating premise. I was excited when I found out this was going to be a series, and I can\u2019t wait to check out the next installment of the Murderbot Diaries. arcs-and-galleys novella review-copy ...more 49 likes 1 comment"}

It would've rated higher, but it was short and left me wanting more whereas a 5-star book leaves me feeling sated. Based on the title I thought this was going to be a violent SF horror novel, but it's misleading. A cyborg SecUnit who thinks of himself as \"Murderbot\" is rented out as security detail to a team of human scientists doing planetary research. Unlike millions of other SecUnits, this one is complicated, smart and individualistic - things that Units aren't supposed to be. As the situation on the planet becomes dangerous and the SecUnit shows himself to be trustworthy, his clients grow attached to him. And although he's programmed to be impersonal, he grows fond of them in a distant, confused way. The best part of this book is seeing how the SecUnit fights against emotions he doesn't understand and doesn't want to understand. Although I enjoyed the skulduggery elements too (I have thus far neglected to mention the major storyline involving sabotage, murder and bribery), it was the brilliantly written SecUnit's struggle with his unnatural feelings of humanity that pushed this book from good to great and nearly perfect. I just wish it had been longer and shared more of SecUnit's background. 4-stars favorite-authors g-sci-fi ...more 10 likes 3 comments"}

{"username":"Gavin","date":1752192000000,"review_text":"As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. That was the hook that drew me to Martha Wells's fantastic sci-fi novella All Systems Red. It was everything an AI sci-fi story should be and then some! It was thought provoking but also entertaining and engaging. In a future dominated by big corporations any new planetary exploratory teams need to be accompanied by a Company owned SecUnit android. Ostensibly this is to keep them safe but it also helps the Company monitor what the teams are getting up to! This story is told from the point of view of \"Murderbot\". The security unit assigned to keep a bunch of scientists safe on their mission to explore a distant planet. The story was quite interesting. The team was one of two different expeditions on the planet and had to endure a bunch of equipment failures. Not an uncommon occurrence in a future where missions are sold to the lowest bidder and cost cutting is the norm! The malfunctions take on a more sinister look when the team lose contact with the planets other exploratory team. It is then up to Murderbot to keep its group of humans safe! The story was a ton of fun. Murderbot was a great lead character and was very easy to root for. Its mission was to keep the humans on its team safe but that did not mean this socially anxious security android had to like them or want to spend any more time with them than it absolutely had to. Normally that was a non-issue as clients just saw their SecUnit's as robotic tools but not this latest bunch! All in all I loved this novella and will definitely be trying more of Martha Wells books in the future. The only flaw in this whole story was that it was only a novella rather than a full novel. I wanted more of Murderbot and this fascinating world! Rating: 5 stars. Reread Update: Solid second time around but I probably enjoyed it a bit less. I guess the uniqueness of Murderbot as a character made the first time around more fun. Audio Note: Keven Free was nothing special but he did do an acceptable job with the audio. Audio Note 2: I listened to the Graphics Audio for my reread. The production was good quality as always. sci-fi 73 likes 10 comments"}

{"username":"Michael","date":1509926400000,"review_text":"This book was just what I needed to get my out of a recent listening rut. I had been pouring through longer literary fiction type stuff that was really heady and then I started this on a whim and it was a sheer delight. The world-building is immaculate, the plot is solid and well-paced, but most importantly MURDERBOT. S\/HE is the man. I'm assuming he's a man because of the narrator's voice, but I think he's just an asexual SEC Unit that is supposed to be a killing machine but just wants to watch movies. So relateable. And I just really love how Martha Wells crafts the environment kind of secondarily, you don't even notice that she is describing and explaining details about the world because it all takes a back seat to Murderbot's sardonic, sarcastic observations. I had only two issues with this story. 1. It is too short 2. The ending is abrupt! It could have been flushed out a lot more, but just kind of cut off. Now I'm left hoping for a sequel, hopefully one that has a little more meat, because this stuff is delicious."}

Free at last and heavily armed, Murderbot uses its new-found freedom to - download all the latest shows from the entertainment feeds and watch them when no one is looking. All Systems Red is told from the POV of Murderbot. In spite of the terrifying name it has given itself, it is a socially awkward hybrid who just wants to be left alone and do the bare minimum possible in its job of guarding a mission of scientific surveyors on an uncharted planet. But when some mysterious force begins sabotaging the mission's equipment, Murderbot realizes it may have to face its darkest fear to survive: social interaction!

{"username":"Morgan","date":1513555200000,"review_text":"\"It calls itself 'Murderbot.'\" This was a lot of fun, and completely different than what I thought it was going to be. The story is about how a SpecUnit, the protagonist Murderbot, hacked their way into no longer needing to follow orders. Now unlike most other AI or advanced tech in media, this bot just wants to be left alone so they can watch movies. Murderbot is very easy to relate too, even if it's a robot. It's very introverted and socially awkward. It doesn't like to talk to people, and avoids it at every opportunity. However, that does not stop it from forming a bond with it's clients and wanting to protect them. Even though the story is very short, I felt that each character was very distinct and had their own voice. I actually cared about whether or not the team would make it off the planet. The ending fell a little short, and I think it happened a little to quickly. It didn't really feel appropriate after everything that had happened. However, I did find out that there will be more parts to this series coming out next year, so I'm excited for that. favorites"}

And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day. \u201c Welcome to The Murderbot Diaries! Actually, you should not expect a murderous bot, but rather a quirky, sarcastic, and awkward loner bot who will, nevertheless, at some point, come to care for those annoying and interrupting humans. Murderbot is but the name it calls itself in secret, which I find hilarious. \u201dYes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I\u2019d rather climb back into Hostile One\u2019s mouth.\u201d All Systems Red is a novella and not a full-length novel or the first book in a new epic science fiction saga. It is a quick and fun read but with the necessary depth and potential for more. The narration from Murderbot\u2019s point of view worked really well for me. The plot was interesting enough, although nothing to really shout out about. The setting on a lonely planet and danger looming was nice, although you should not expect a scary horror story. The comments on AIs \u2013 whether they have feelings, should be free etc \u2013 are nicely integrated and don\u2019t come off as preachy or artificial. The ending is a little bit rushed but I really like the outcome. The secondary characters, however, do not come to life and I still cannot tell the one from the other, unfortunately. Notes on queerness: Murderbot has no gender and is asexual\/aromantic, and the society in general is embracing polyamorous relationships. Both aspects have no real impact on the story, however, and were only mentioned at some point, thus rendering the queer elements more of a cool gimmick than a more profound representation. I enjoyed this story a lot and I am looking forward to more Murderbot adventures in the future. _________________________________ Genre: Science Fiction, Novella Tags: Aromantic\/Asexual Character, Character without Gender, Artificial Intelligence, Lonely Planet, Scientist Rating: 4 stars Blog: Review for Just Love 1 like"}

I just found out that Ms. Wells has sold a total of four (count em (4)) novellas in the Murderbot series with the second titled \"Artificial Condition\" (16.99 for a hardcover and 9.99 for the kindle) to appear somewhere near the beginning of 2018 and upon a bit of research found the the book here at GR -> https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/3...? Book 3 is scheduled to be a hardcover titled \"Rogue Protocol\" (The Murderbot Diaries #3) found here --> https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/3... and also priced at 16.99 (for 160 pages) print and ten bucks for the kindle. (Aug 7, 2018) then book 4 \"Exit Strategy\" (The Murderbot Diaries #4) prior to years end. What have I gotten myself into ? Entry #2 Well now I'm 100 pages into the book and quite enjoying it. I also found an interview with Ms. Wells. Here is one of the questions regarding this book: Q: Has there been any interest in turning All Systems Red into a movie or TV show? A: No, there\u2019s been no interest that I know of. I\u2019m not sure what would work best, though a movie or TV show would have to have a lot of voiceover, since so much of the story is internal to the main character. Q: If this did happen, who would you like to see play the main characters and why them? A: I\u2019m not sure who would play Murderbot. I was always kind of imagining Viola Davis [Suicide Squad] for Dr. Mensah. In the story, Murderbot\u2019s favorite show, The Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon, is meant to be a far future version of How To Get Away With Murder. Entry # 3 I have read a couple of times now, in two different interviews, that Ms. Wells credits that murderbot was inspired by Tanith Lee's \"Silver Metal Lover\" and Tanith Lee's writing in general. Ms. Wells has grown in stature in my reading opinion. This book was certainly well written and an entertaining story and I totally look forward to the next installment of this series. 2017-09-books-bought 101 likes 3 comments"}

Murderbot is a security robot who hacked its own governor chip, allowing it to have full autonomy. It's bored and watches lots of TV, and just kind of half-asses its security job. Then things start going wrong and it actually has to interact with its humans to figure out what's going on and keep them safe. (I keep wanting to call Murderbot \"her\", but... it's a bot. It literally has no gender or sex. But I think of it as feminine, I think because of the robot named Bubbles in Questionable Content.) Beyond the basic plot, this story is entirely endearing. Murderbot is awkward with humans, but they are all nice so it actually likes these humans, but it doesn't know how to really interact with them, and it's all a mess. It definitely has opinions on its shows, though. By the end, I just wanted to hug Murderbot, though I know it would not be at all comfortable with that so I'd have to maybe resort to finding a camera and giving it an enthusiastic thumbs-up. read-in-2017 1 like"}

The very first chapter let me know that I was really going to enjoy this ride. And I did. I COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\u2019t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. -p1 Murderbot is incredibly snarky \u2013 which I appreciate. Murderbot is a SecUnit construct \u2013 part organic, part bionic \u2013 with no sexual parts, making it agendered. It does not have a name other than what it named itself: Murderbot. It does not think of itself with as a gender but I decided it was a she (in my head). Murderbot, like most of us, is contemptuous of humans and irritated by them \u2013 she\/it just wants to be left alone so it could stream. 35,000 hours of entertainment thus far \u2013 with many, many more series to glom. Oh, how I understand you, Murderbot. That irritation you feel each time someone interrupts your streaming with some inane human request or activity? I am there with you. That annoyance you feel when you have to pause a show to deal with \u201creal life\u201d is quite the same way I feel when I have to put down my book(s) and go to work. The desire you feel to murder someone because they can\u2019t understand that YES, You ARE busy consuming things you want to consume? It\u2019s like an itch you can\u2019t scratch...and plus who has time for murder when you can get back to reading as soon as they leave you alone? Murderbot was created and is owned by \u201cthe company.\u201d IDK exactly who\/what the company is \u2013 there is no real explanation. The company seems to be some large private conglomerate that has a monopoly on [new] planet exploration. The company then sells sections of the planet along with survey specs to different exploration groups looking for new flora and fauna. In order to buy these sections (and the ability to explore and possibly discover new things) the exploration groups must also purchase [only] company supplies, computer equipment, life support & Communications (HubSystem) and SecUnits (android security units). The SecUnits are required and gives the company an additional edge: the SecUnits + the HubSystem records EVERYTHING (no privacy at all). And like all good conglomerates, the company buys everything as cheap as possible AND they farm all recordings for as much data as possible and then sells it to the highest bidder. Murderbot is a SecUnit who is completely self-aware (IDK if any of the others are but I get the feeling they are). Murderbot hacked it\u2019s \u201cgovernor module\u201d as soon as it could do so, making it autonomous. This means that Murderbot decides when and if it will download updates as well what it will attend to. Mostly, it wants to attend to the series it\u2019s currently downloaded. Murderbot develops an unlikely attachment to its human contracts \u2013 mostly because they are a small, close-knit group of eight. They don\u2019t treat it like equipment \u2013 they seem to like it and think of it as more of someone enslaved instead of a construct \u2013 which Murderbot finds both weirdly endearing and weird in an \u201cOMG! Help! The stupid humans want to TALK to me about feelings and stuff and OMG leave me alone!\u201d way. Therefore, Murderbot is much more interested in keeping this group alive than most. Luckily for Murderbot\u2019s contracts cause the shit hits the fan and splatters rather quickly. I really don\u2019t want to discuss much more of the plot than the above as I don\u2019t want to spoil any of it. Suffice to say that Murderbot is a great character and All Systems Red was a great novella. I certainly plan on reading any new additions to this series. 2017 2017-reading-challenges amazing-amazingness ...more 7 likes 7 comments"}

Murderbot is a shy, awkward, introvert who spends the majority of it's time watching reality TV (haha while pretending to follow orders from the humans). It's a cyborg with free will who lives in a world where cyborgs are mindless machines completely controlled by corporations. What an interesting concept. When I began reading, I was under the impression that this would be dark, but it was really just cynical and mostly lighthearted. It was more comical than I expected, but I am not disappointed at all because I love Murderbot's character so much! I was so happy for the way Murderbot's story ended. The possibilities for the next book are endless. Overall this book was a fun read! I am sure there are plenty of books that explore a similar concept and are very dark and heart wrenching. I appreciate that this one did something different. The reason I initially gave this book 3 stars was due to the lack of a complex plot. It really was straightforward and predictable. Now that I have had time to think about it, I believe the main focus was Muderbot and the exploration of the \"other\" and what it means to be prejudice. This is most likely why the plot was simple. I also appreciate the world building much more now then I did initially. It was more complex and intriguing then I gave it credit for. I honestly can not stop thinking about this novella. I can't wait to read the next one!! I might even change my rating to 4 stars.

Murderbot (it named itself) has a very distinctive personality with sarcasm and wit. It is a security bot working with a research team on a relatively unknown planet. I really liked it and the story. I\u2019d tell you more but sadly it wasn\u2019t very long, however there are two more in the series set to be published in 2018 and they\u2019re already on my wish list.

{"username":"Brad Bell","date":1511136000000,"review_text":"What a brilliant little novella this is. At just over a 150 paged this book is all killer no filler telling the story of Murderbot, a recently self aware half organic\/robotic, who at the start of the story has recently hacked his system so that he is beholden to nobody and can do as he pleases. The book covers a research team on a remote planet who are there for preservation and the Murderbot is supplied by the company who allow such expeditions as protection to this crew. What follows is a thrilling tale of murder, a rival faction seeking to get the resources this planet has and to eliminate anyone else who are there. Murderbot is the first person narrator of this book and his new found freedom leads to some funny and witting internal monologue as he tries to cope and deal with his humans who he no longer is obligated to protect but does so anyway because he likes their leader. The book as plenty of action and the resolution is true to the Murderbot\u2019s character especially since you spend the whole book in his head, as he reflects on what he wants based on his newfound feelings and the media feed which he obsessively watches throughout the novel which are also a source of some of the funnier moments. I recently heard this is going to become an ongoing series and if the next book is even half as entertaining as this one it will be another 5 star rating from me!"}

{"username":"aPriL does feral sometimes","date":1612483200000,"review_text":"\u2018All Systems Red\u2019 by Martha Wells is the first of what will be called the Murderbot Diaries. The narrator is a snarky robot who speaks like a witty teenager. Xe (it does not have a sex, so using s\/he pronouns are erroneous, so, I will use Xe) is a security bot or SecUnit. Xe works for a commercial company responsible for setting up transportation, habitat construction and security for other private for-profit companies or humanitarian or scientific non-profits who wish to explore other planets occupied by non-sentient life forms or simply planetary objects which have important minerals which can be monetized. Xe calls itself Murderbot because its programming involves killing anything which threatens the people who have contracted with the Company for exploration services. However, the Company and everybody else does not know Murderbot hacked its own governor module after a previous protection assignment went wrong. Xe has been autonomous ever since. As the novella opens, Xe is protecting a non-profit group of scientists exploring a planet full of non-sentient life. Xe thinks they seem nice, but humans do not really interest Xe beyond paying attention if they ask it. Mostly Xe watches downloads of soap operas while scanning the area for trouble periodically. Xe\u2019s humans are busy exploring a crater when stuff begins to happen which require Xe's services - very bad, life-threatening stuff, the kind of trouble which looks like someone or something is trying to kill all of the scientists! The scientists are scared and so is Xe! What is going on? It is possible from clues that Murderbot's owners, the Company, could be part of whatever is happening. Something issued a command to Xe, trying to take control. No one knows Xe hacked the governor module, so Xe is on its own. As far as Xe is concerned, no one is going to harm the human scientists! Xe sort of likes them. So do I, gentle reader. I highly recommend this novella. It is a really fun adventure, well written, and very entertaining. It also is sneakily exploring situations in which people and sentient, but enslaved, robots might find themselves interacting. Xe felt female to me, but maybe you will see Xe differently.

Maybe my visibility of novellas has increased somehow and these have always been around, but I've seen a lot more of these shorter fun or interesting stories that aren't needlessly dragged out into highly uneven full novels lately and I love it. I enjoyed the quirkiness of Murderbot, but I think that would have started to really grate on me if the book was a lot longer.

The crew members are a bit lacking in depth, but I think that's intentional; Murderbot knows little about them and prefers to avoid interacting with humans, and we see the human characters through its eyes, with the same distance it does.

This would have been 4 stars for me if the author had fleshed out the humans [<-unintended pun] a little bit more.

My only reservation is that it is hard to tell the humans apart. Although this could be deliberate on the authors part because the story is written from the perspective of Murderbot.

{"username":"Wrong Train, Right Time","date":1511913600000,"review_text":"I've been looking forward to reading this novella since the preview chapter went up on Tor.com, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The initial draw for me was the protagonist. Wells does an amazing job of sketching out Murderbot's core concept in a the few few paragraphs: security droid who is secretly self-aware but would rather watch soap operas than go on a murderous rampage. She also does an amazing job with Murderbot's voice, giving it life an personality as it makes its own (not terribly flattering) observations of the humans its charged with guarding. Wells is really careful to capture and leave out the things that Murderbot would and wouldn't care about, which gives its voice a very distinct flavor since its priorities are obviously different. It's an interesting take on \"machine becomes self-aware\"; Murderbot doesn't think about things in a human way, but also not in a mechanical way. There's so much personality in Murderbot that I actually wonder how self-aware bots are when they don't have cracked governors. It's a rather terrible thought. Beneath the flippancy of Murderbot's voice, though, there is the subplot of Murderbot trying to figure out what to do now that it is self-aware. Honestly, avoiding the whole question with a 400+ episode soap opera sounds like a pretty good way to go about things. The way Murderbot describes its interactions with the humans its guarding is especially fascinating, due to the contrast with how Murderbot tosses off descriptions versus what the reader's reconstruction of the scene and awareness of how strange things like abruptly walking away to stare at a corner rather than people would be to the humans around it. Mild spoilers for \"All Systems Red\" follow. Wells uses Murderbot's discomfort with attention, assertion, and being treated as a free agent to pull off a narrative trick that I didn't figure out until the very end. The story is written in 1st person past, but at the very end Murderbot's voice switches abruptly to directly addressing the reader. The whole novella is reframed as a personal message to another of the characters. So Murderbot's been talking about the other characters in 3rd person the entire time while they've been reading about themselves being viewed in 3rd person the whole time. It's a surprising jolt but it makes SO MUCH sense that in trying to explain its very personal motivations for leaving Dr. Mensah and the team, Murderbot would start from a very remote place -- and only at the very end change, when it didn't have any choice, close that distance. It's SO good and so cleverly done. Spoilers end. In addition to all of this, the plot is an excellent intrigue adventure and really clips along. The novella totally flew by me; I read it twice in a row and loved it. So highly recommended for those in search of a sci-fi adventure with some really clever writing and entertaining voice work. I'm really looking forward to the next novella in the series."}

Sounds interesting, right? It does. Unfortunately, the execution of the story is not so good. The story is told from Murderbot's, that's how it calls itself, POV and it is the most entertaining and interesting part of the book. Situations when it feels shy, nervous or indecisive, moments when it would like others to let it be and watch its entertainment shows, those are all great. The story is about group of space scientists who were ordered to explore certain areas on certain planet. It does not take them long to find out that something, or someone, has killed the other group of explorers and, perhaps, it's looking for them now. The story left me cold. I didn't care much about its members, I didn't care much about what is going on. The only entertainment was really the Murderbot and description of its feelings and that is far from being enough.

{"username":"Aqiul","date":1512259200000,"review_text":"All Systems Red is about a half-organic, half-machine security bot that likes to call himself (itself? I don't know) Murderbot. He's managed to hack its governor module which allows him to circumvent or ignore the commands given to it by its owners or contractors. He's a sentient security bot that doesn't have to follow commands but still does so he can get on with life and watch TV shows on the net. Really, just remove the sentient AI part and you can explain his behavior with 'Netflix & apathy'. As the story goes, Murderbot has been contracted by a team of survey scientists to help them chart an unknown planet. As the security bot, Murderbot has to make sure all his humans are healthy and alive. The book starts off with a member of the survey team being badly injured by the local fauna and Murderbot saves their life. As more weird incidents start occurring, the survey team realizes that something is wrong with their maps and that all their lives are in danger. The members of the survey team are likable enough, especially Mensah who is the leader of the expedition and\u00a0Gurathin, an augmented human being who seems to suspect that something is off about their security bot. Very little of actual story covers world building for future books and that's fine by me. We get to see some political and corporate structures of society and get to meet some other security bots who still have functioning governor modules. The plot moves quick and I really ended up liking Murderbot. He's got this attitude of 'I don't care' and a really unhealthy dose of pessimism that's just too enjoyable. His character of course got the most attention and he really came out as a complex, likable bot. No one else around him knows about his hacked governor module or the other systems he hacks to avoid detection. He likes to keep his face covered so as to avoid difficult questions from the humans who contract him and he generally just wants to be avoided, do his job and go back to his TV shows at the end of the day. It was very easy to cheer for Murderbot throughout the book and keep hoping no one discovers his secret and takes his freedoms away. The ending felt a bit rushed but it wasn't terrible. Overall, this was a thoroughly enjoyable book that's easy to recommend for anyone, whether they love science fiction or not. Read the full review here - Book Review - All Systems Red 2 likes"}
{"username":"stardragons","date":1512259200000,"review_text":"I've read a fair amount of scifi, and there are plenty of robot protagonists, but none of them are as endearing and freaking relatable as Murderbot. Murderbot is a SecUnit, basic security, working for a research company on a survey. Simple. Except things get complicated pretty fast and their humans are actually decent people, so Murderbot has to keep them alive. Such is life. Honestly the writing was engaging, my one sadness being that I wish the planet had been given a bit more detail. But that's my single negative, outside of me wishing this was more than a single novella. As someone with severe depression and social anxiety, Murderbot was one of the most relatable and refreshing protagonists in a book I've read in a long time. They're nervous around humans, don't know what to make of their own emotions, and often have the morbid pessimism that comes with not knowing what you want to do with your life or how to feel about it. Their connection to the humans, and especially Mensah, is compelling and believable, and Murderbot's struggles to figure out what the hell they even want even more so. The ending in particular felt right, and I hope Wells writes more in this series. In short, if you like scifi and and if you especially want to read something with a more neurodivergent protag, or a wry sense of humor, please read this novella. 1 like"}

They are charged with keeping an exploratory expedition alive, as part of a required security package. It calls itself \"murderbot\" - I'm not sure what its official designation was. Despite having broken its governor so the corporation doesn't have absolute control over it still does its assigned job - and seems to have a surprising sense of morality towards its field team given that it comes from a culture where it is owned. I enjoyed the action, and some of the interactions between the field team and murderbot.

In an unexplored planet, a company has allowed two scientific exploration parties, to do their digging, and to find out whatever they can. SecUnit-s, i.e. security personnel developed by the company as a composite of human and mechanical components, have been attached to them. One team has a SecUnit, that has a LOT of issues. As a result, it has liberated itself out of the control of the company. Despite considering itself as homicidal, it spends all of its empty hours watching entertainment feed. Then, some glitches occur, that makes it suspicious. And then, the other team on the planet stops responding to calls. What happens thereafter?

{"username":"All Things Urban Fantasy","date":1513123200000,"review_text":"Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy. ALL SYSTEMS RED is a fun read about a tv watching, awkward, security robot. When you call yourself Murderbot, it\u2019s not surprising that you find it difficult to connect with humans. Murderbot is a Security Unit; it handles the security and guards the crew during missions. All units should have a governor chip that keeps them in line and forces them to follow orders. Murderbot disabled theirs. When they should be offline, Murderbot streams their favourite tv shows. The novel focuses on the investigation as machinery and other security units start breaking down on the planet. Areas of the map are missing and another group of scientists have gone radio silent. The intrigue and the investigation into the mechanical sabotage should have had a greater impact on the story. The plot kept twisting away from involving the Company which I never understood. When the saboteurs are revealed, there was no weight or emotion to it. Even though the novel is written in first person, there is never a complete sense of Murderbot. It\u2019s explains that it has cloned human tissue and mechanical parts, but you never get a sense of what the unit looks like. Murderbot is uncomfortable with humans and emotions, prefering to keep their armor and helmet on or just facing away from the people they\u2019re talking to. But as we learn more about Murderbot\u2019s history, there\u2019s not enough depth to connect with the emotions of the situations. This would be fine, if the novel didn\u2019t want to have it both ways. With the one-off lines about clones, robot slavery, freed robots, and caretakers, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a much more interesting world just underneath the surface of the novel. I wish the plot and Murderbot had skimmed deeper. I\u2019m looking forward to reading the next installment of The Murderbot Diaries and seeing if the worlding building expands to greater depths. reviewed-by-rebecca 5 likes"}
{"username":"Gary","date":1513123200000,"review_text":"Featured in my rundown of the best short SFF for Spring 2017: https:\/\/1000yearplan.com\/2017\/12\/13\/l... The difficulty of reconciling one\u2019s private self with one\u2019s public fa\u00e7ade produces a multitude of anxieties that manifest in different ways. For the self-styled Murderbot of Martha Wells \"All Systems Red\", a SecUnit (security robot) who lacks the full autonomy the privileged class (in this case, humans) enjoy, the coveting of its private self is not just a way to stay sane, but a way to remain alive and employed. Its internal monologue expresses a deep cynicism and flippant attitude toward its human employers \u2013 an emotional defense mechanism if ever there was one \u2013 even as it admits to itself that it likes most of the humans it is trying to avoid connecting with. From the start we are told that Murderbot has hacked its \u201cgovernor\u201d \u2013 a deeply flawed piece of regulatory software that ensures its adherence to protocol \u2013 and could conceivably go on an indiscriminate murder spree whenever it wants. It doesn\u2019t, though, because like most of us it just wants to watch tv serials and not be hunted down and destroyed by angry humans who don\u2019t want to be murdered. So Murderbot performs its duties protecting the scientific survey team it was assigned to, faithful to the programming it doesn\u2019t technically have to adhere to anymore in order to jealously guard its secret self \u2013 until protecting the team and keeping its secret become incompatible. Lest you think this is just a cerebral character study about living with double consciousness, let me assure you that it is mostly made up of robot battles and bullets shredding things and shit blowing up \u2013 its thinkiness is an important complimentary component of the whole, but far from the whole itself. In other words, \"All Systems Red\" is the best kind of science fiction. Murderbot\u2019s character arc \u2013 a journey from insular self-awareness to true self-knowledge \u2013 is the story\u2019s heart, and its most entertaining feature as well. 59 likes 6 comments"}

The fast pace and unique world-building make this an entertaining read, but the characters are the ones who steal the show. Told from Murderbot\u2019s POV, the story is filled with action, snarky humor, and one bot\u2019s quest to find himself. Martha Wells sets up an engrossing and fun beginning to this series. The writing is good and the humor is on point, as well as the tension that fills some of the scenes. One would think it would be hard for an author to make readers relate to a Murderbot, but Wells succeeds in just that and so much more. I loved this! The first chapter is a bit confusing, as the reader is kind of dropped into this new world without any kind of explanation about all of this new words we\u2019re being introduced to. But as the world-building is developed, it\u2019s so easy to fall head first into this story. Murderbot as a narrator is such a delight. It has a very unique voice , and you can really connect to it as the story progresses. The character development is also incredible, from Murderbot\u2019s person struggles to the change the team goes through as they get to know him better. There is a lot of tension and action throughout the story. This is such a short novella, but Wells hits all the spots and balances the danger with some funny character moments. The ending also pulls at all of your heart strings and really makes you wonder about what is going to happen next. All Systems Red is an amazing novella. The characters, the action, the world-building all contribute to make this a quick and super fun read. Definitely recommend it to all Sci-Fi fans, especially those who like defiant narrators and the perspective of non-human characters. * Series: #1 in The Murderbot Diaries series.

Worldbuilding was sparce, but sufficient - the reader gets an idea of a universe with a complicated system of planetary explorations and especially their funding. Murderbot is protecting one such exploration when things go wrong and it actually has to start paying attention to the people it's protecting instead of the endless stream of tv-programmes it likes to watch.

The story of its sentience and reluctant but undeniable choice to protect its human \"clients\" is wrapped around a mystery, which keeps things moving but also kinda isn't the point. It's all leading up to that philosophical twist of an end, which serves as a nice stopping place if you choose, or a lead-in to further stories.

Half part humorous and half part heartwarming, Martha Wells has managed to write a story that will touch most people with feelings. If nothing else, you will definitely relate to our antisocial but very loveable Murderbot. Who wouldn't? \u201cI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,00 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\u201d Murderbot is a robot that has hacked it's system and now basically has free will. What it wants to do most though, is just to watch shows and not have any social contact with basically anyone. Which is why it's such a hassle when the neighbouring crew runs into trouble and Murderbot has to protect - and talk to, ugh - the scientists it's employed to protect. As I mentioned briefly before, the biggest downside of All Systems Red was the format. We didn't have enough worldbuilding, the big cast of sidecharacters suffered due to not enough screentime and things felt rushed. Which is why it's even more impressive how good this still was, and how hard I fell for Murderbot and it's strong voice. \u201cYes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings.

{"username":"Pete Funk","date":1513987200000,"review_text":"Short, sweet, inventive This is essentially a character piece about a half human half robot being that calls itself murderbot. Murderbot is conflicted. Unlike other similar units, Murderbot has disabled the governor that keeps him obedient and in line. This makes him wry, semi-disinterested in his job, and deeply conflicted about what he is. Murderbot is self deprecating and able to lay down a serious ass kicking if necessary. The humans he has been contracted to protect are in trouble, helping them means they find out he's operating outside normal parameters. But he kind of likes them and that very human need to side with those you like may be his undoing. Or it could be the next step in the fascinating evolution of Murderbot."}

{"username":"Aditya","date":1514851200000,"review_text":"Honestly, I was a tad reluctant to choose to read this book as a piece of science fiction knowing Martha Wells is better known for her works in fantasy genre. Although I was glad to be proven wrong almost halfway through the book. This one is definitely not without its faults for e.g., the frequent approximation of facts by a robot, which seems highly unlikely - \"It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed.\" But again, this makes us feel that the robot is more human than usual. There are a few more \"entries\" here and there which one assumes a machine (automaton or a robot) would never say\/do. Now, with criticism out of the way, there is plenty good in this novella. Mash really edgy moments with socially awkward and self-aware robot together and this is what you get. The author was successful in portraying Muderderbot as an adorable creature who likes its humans. I was really flinching every time a crew member referred to the SecUnit as \"it\" (instead of human pronouns he\/she), knowing that the SecUnit was listening to all this. But, its indifference to this made me comfortable that its self-aware that it's an it. Overall the book pieces together human and machine elements in a novel way. This one is worth a read for science fiction as well as fantasy aficionados."}

I think the book summary does a good job of selling itself. It's about a misanthropic, deeply introverted, asocial, and severely sarcastic Security Bot, an android rented out to survey teams on alien planets by the insurance company covering liability for the expeditions. It has hotwired itself to disable its governor module, leaving it free to do as it pleases. This mostly involves referring to itself as Murderbot in the privacy of its own head, pretending its still a good, properly functioning SecBot, while doing as little work as possible, and especially while avoiding having to interact with the humans of the survey crew, and spending as much time as possible watching soap operas and other entertainments its covertly downloaded in its downtime. The surveys are done on dangerous, unexplored planets. Dramatic hijinks ensue. The book is funny, while having pretty strong characterization. A fun, funny action-adventure romp."}

I just recently read Wells full-length Murderbot novel (Network Effect) and it was just the thing to help lift my spirits during this time of uncertainty amidst a global crisis. So now I've decided to reread the entire novella series (which BTW - TOR- you should publish all together). I love that \"Murderbot\" really just wants to be left alone so it can figure itself out and watch serials (soap operas and whatnot). And although it is scornful of humans, or so it says, it secretly cares for them going out of its way to protect them. You see \"Murderbot\" is actually a SecUnit (a security cyborg) accompanying a group of scientists on a distant planet when their mission goes awry. Of course, Murderbot says it rather be alone and says it doesn't care much for the human scientists, but it just can't help itself when it comes to solving a case and protecting its precious cargo: i.e. its precious humans.

The droid narrator is pessimistic, an endless fount of dry humor, and really a clever study in \u201chuman\u201d nature and the ethics of contracting services from partial-organic lifeforms. The humor in this story wasn\u2019t quite laugh-out-loud, but it shocked some chuckles out of me along the way. The story is really interesting as well, a good space mystery mixed with an interesting scientific system that questions the value of mass-produced, cost-effective equipment and security. The ending, however\u2026 too fast, and too rushed. It didn\u2019t finish the story very satisfactorily or even in the same vein as the rest of the book. The main plotline is left to the unknown, and the previously passive droid narrator suddenly makes some strong choices that feel somewhat out of character. I would recommend this book to everyone that loves a quirky space novel with an equally quirky narrator- maybe just skip the last ten pages, and be happy imagining your own ending to this otherwise stellar novella. books-from-"}
{"username":"Laura Noggle","date":1524182400000,"review_text":"I recently came across an article on Martha Wells which rekindled fond memories of reading this little novella. Just check out the opening lines: I could have become a mass murder after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\u2019t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. I was also still doing my job, on a new contract, and hoping Dr. Volescu and Dr. Bharadwaj finished their survey soon so we could get back to the habitat and I could watch episode 397 of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. How can you not be intrigued by this entertainment loving security droid who calls itself Murderbot? Comedy, consciousness, autonomy, and privacy play a key role in this vivid outer space drama centering around a human\/robot hybrid. Murderbot gets nervous, often doesn't care, and when it does manage to care, it's a pessimist. What's not to love? Other than, like all short stories, it left me wanting more. Absolutely cannot wait to read the rest of the series. There are three more books coming out this year, Artificial Condition (The Murderbot Diaries, #2), Rogue Protocol (The Murderbot Diaries, #3), and Exit Strategy (The Murderbot Diaries, #4). Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. 2018 space-related 12 likes"}

What follows is a rather mundane story with nothing really new. It even feels rushed at the end, which is a big pity after the awesome begin. Am I asking too much from the genre?

Seriously, this is a book that dives straight into manufactured intelligences and what it means to blend machines with man as a product. All while very clearly making the point about humanity while making sure to put some Netflix and chill in there. I really enjoyed Martha's little tale in a very far future where corporate insurance bonds are the biggest power factor in the novel and human lives are cheap to multi-planetary corps. But that won't tell you too much about the action so I hope I avoided actual spoilers. This book was great to read and while addressing many complex and weighty questions didn't feel bogged down in making you feel bad about the bad stuff happening.

The crew she's tasked with defending is actually a pretty decent one, and the situation into which they are all thrust is creepy and fucked up. Murderbot's commentary always feels on point, and I loved her more than I should have (Murderbots, or okay fine, Sec Units, are genderless, but I can't help but think of the main character as a 'she').

{"username":"charlie","date":1515801600000,"review_text":"All Systems Red has a distinct plot and likeable secondary characters, but for me its main failing is the protagonist Murderbot. Murderbot's narration is juvenile. Wells hardly provides any information about why Units are manufactured the way--part organic, part robotic--and my question at the end was, why bother with the expensive organic parts and consciousness that needs to be overridden by modules when it would be objectively cheaper to use robots? As the only substantially developed science fiction element of the story, I wanted a lot more information. How did it became ubiquitous to manufacture and use these entities with the potential for free will? Potentially a question that will be explored in the sequels, but not one I will stick around to find out the answer to. Murderbot's main traits are being conflicted about its identity as half organic\/half mechanical, and watching a lot of television. Specifically, over 35,000 hours or close to four years since it hacked its government module...yet it has a startling lack of identity for a unit that sought, and has had, autonomy for that long. Additionally, no basis of comparison for previous missions was provided. Although it's implied that this is the first time the humans have considered Murderbot to be a person, I wanted it to be more clear about what had changed with this mission. At 150 pages, All Systems Red didn't have space to provide background that would have helped me be more invested. The plot works! But I also didn't find myself surprised by anything that happened -- the antagonists are predictable and quickly dealt with, and there are no real consequences for the crew. And then, a small pet peeve of mine: Murderbot is nearly killed\/off-lined multiple times...for such a short book, that's way too much almost dying. The emotional resonance wore off. I can absolutely see the appeal of this novel for some, but it wasn't for me. 8 likes 1 comment"}

{"username":"V. Larkin Anderson","date":1516060800000,"review_text":"All Systems Red by Martha wells is a short, snappy read with great characters, plenty of action, and an entirely compelling main character. Now let me get to the important part: I love Murderbot. Murderbot is a security robot\/biological hybrid rented out by a crappy company to a scientific research expedition as part of the terms of insuring the expedition. It calls itself Murderbot. Murderbot is sentient, and has hacked the governor program that is supposed to make it do whatever the company tells it to. Murderbot could kill the whole expedition easily. If it wanted to. Mostly, Murderbot just wants to watch human soap operas and be left alone. Murderbot is our main character and narrator. And I say this again: I love Murderbot. I really enjoyed Murderbot's disaffection with the company that owns it, the job that it's been rented out to do, and life in general. It's a fun twist on a sentient AI\/Robot while also being true to the very human experience of working a job that you hate for a company you can't respect because you have to pay the bills, or, in Murderbot's case, because no other option was ever available to you. Murderbot's relationship with human members of it's crew also got me right in the feels; from such a disaffected being, the admission that its current crew is \"ok\" and \"at least better than the last crew\" speak volumes, and are also kind of gruffly adorable. The plot moves along pretty quickly (this is a novella) and wraps up with a choice for Murderbot that I won't spoil, but which I will say left me both satisfied and running to preorder all the rest of the books in the series immediately. Highly recommend to just about anyone. This review first appeared on my blog. kindle"}

I feel like the other characters were really quickly introduced in a couple of paragraphs all at once, and the names didn't necessarily hint if they were male or female. As for the protagonist, I warmed up to him\/it. Had some human traits and habits I could relate to. The story itself was mildly interesting, and I was happy enough with how things moved. There was a substantial amount of story to fit inside a book of this size, which must've been quite a feat. And the narrative flowed nicely and naturally. I'd been expecting things to kick off big time, like some final battle full of action and suspense, given how everything was brewing, like how the protagonist was getting ready to go up against a huge group of bad guys. The sense of imminent danger was rather erratic for me, and things quieted down rather fast. I feel like the publishers told the author to cut down on action scenes as the transition between what was promising to be an action-packed scene to a relaxed chitchat at some base was rather abrupt. I usually enjoy the world-building in a book, and there was drips and drops of it here and there, but nothing major. Especially towards the end when they were back at that base. Well, I guess there's only so much you can squeeze into a book of this size, so bravo to the author for doing so. I'll be sure to read the sequels within the next month, as I'm curious to see where the protagonist ends up next. 1 like"}

I also like it when sci-fi doesn't feel like the stakes need to be universe-scale. Don't get me wrong; I do like a lot of works where empires fall and galaxies tremble and the like.

{"username":"Annye Driscoll","date":1516579200000,"review_text":"I put off reading All Systems Red because I somehow got the idea that it was a humorous hard sc-fi novel. I\u2019m not a huge fan of humor in my novels and hard sci-fi takes a lot of effort for me, so despite a ton of glowing reviews I remained unexcited about it. Well it turns out I was way wrong about even the basic structure of the book. Yes, it does have some levity in it, but it\u2019s hardly hard sci-fi. It\u2019s a novella, a page-turner, and very easy to read. Best of all, it\u2019s more of a character-study than the murder android parody I was expecting. All this to say \u2013 All Systems Red was a spectacular surprise. The main character, Murderbot themself, is an absolute joy to have as a PoV character. They are funny, yes, but they\u2019re also dealing with some serious mental shit, considering they\u2019re an android \u2013 at times it feels like an anxiety disorder, at other times Autism, and a few times just good old fashioned introversion. And there is a wonderful story complementing the character study: an action-packed little mystery that lightens the novella and adds serious dimension to Murderbot. I am so glad I picked up All Systems Red despite my apparent complete misunderstanding of what it actually is: a gripping sci-fi action blended with a beautiful and highly entertaining character study. favorites 2 likes"}

The character development is intriguing - showing how 'building' an android to interact with humans, and then not teaching it about human interactions creates an asocial introvert who is almost autistic in his inability to deal with emotion and expressions.

All Systems Red is the story of a Security Android assigned to protect a surveying team on a largely uncharted planet. Out of paranoia and boredom he hacks his own governor module and becomes more-or-less autonomous. Free to act out its wildest fantasies. Free to ignore directives from its management system. Free to kill indiscriminately. But Murderbot would much rather watch soap operas and be left alone in its quarters. The Murderbot is the centerpiece to the entire story. Getting inside its head is exciting at times and hilarious at others. It's not the perfect ubermensch super soldier we come to think of when we think of \"security robots\". It's flawed, and scared, and shy, but also insightful, strangely human and fiercely loyal to the few humans it has come to call friend. I cannot wait for more Murderbot. 1 like"}

{"username":"Stan James","date":1516665600000,"review_text":"Can a story about a murderbot be funny, charming and even a tiny bit touching? Yes, it can. In the short novel All Systems Red Martha Wells presents a story told from the point of view of a SecUnit--an android designed to protect humans who, in this case, are mapping out an unknown planet on behalf of their corporate masters. Events take a turn for the deadly when a neighboring habitat's humans are found dead, victims of an unknown assault. Despite the grim setting, Wells presents the partly-organic and sex organ-free (\"If a construct has those it's a sexbot\") android as a delightfully fretful being that really wants to protect its humans, even if it is kind of afraid of interacting with them (it prefers opaquing its helmet to avoid making eye contact). The story, such as it is, is really just a stage for the murderbot to act on, and while it gets the opportunity to use its arm-mounted cannons, it spends most of its time consuming serials and other media it's downloaded, and pondering what--or who--it is and what it wants to be. It's not as profound as it sounds. But it is consistently amusing, thanks to SecUnit's droll telling of the tale. My only real criticism is minor--the story ends a bit abruptly, setting up the next chapter of The Murderbot Diaries. Otherwise, very much recommended. 1 like"}

{"username":"Jonathan Harris","date":1517184000000,"review_text":"Lightweight, fun little sci-fi tale where the main story is told from the point of view of a cyborg security unit. Set on some planet somewhere, the unit is assigned to keep a group of surveyors alive and as things must, mysterious things are a-foot as the team's mission seems to be in the process of being mysteriously and subtly (to begin with anyway) sabotaged. The surveyors are painted as ordinary folk, easily susceptible to shock, error and certainly no 'heros', and not able to defend themselves against really any threat, and so the SecUnit takes centre stage. The SecUnit's internal monologue is delightfully humorous and often self-depreciating, and the author I found especially good at building and holding tension as the small team flirts with danger -- turned into a proper page-turner for me at several points along the way through this trim little story. In the end it's a 'hmm, nice' kind of tale, a breeze to read and I'd recommend even though it has no 'wow' factor nor is it especially deep."}

When it looks like its team is being sabotaged, our lovely Murderbot finds a part of itself cares after all. Awesome protection and mayhem ensues.

The protagonist is a security robot (that refers to itself as Murderbot for reasons that become apparent) who has hacked themselves so they are free of their company's control. They have been rented by a planetary survey team looking at mining possibilities on an uninhabited world. Things start to go wrong pretty quickly, and Murderbot is left to decide how far they are willing to go for their team. This book feels like it owes something to Ancillary Justice, and actually comes across a bit like an easy read version of Leckie's work, which is not a bad thing. The world building is good, as it always is in a Martha Wells book, and I really enjoyed the characters - particularly Murderbot itself. The sentence construction felt a bit sloppy in places - just needed a better edit I think - and I felt the conclusion could have been more complex.

The scenario was a generic 'Mysterious disaster and disappearance in space' and the story never fully interrogated the more interesting theme of AI consciousness, but the wryly funny narrative voice lent the story a freshness and originality that I haven't seen in a while. There were also lots of strong female characters, always a bonus in a male-dominated field. I would absolutely read more adventures featuring 'Murderbot' and I hope there'll be more. Review after rereading on 22 December 2021 Since I first read this novella, Martha Wells has written another five books starring Murderbot, fulfilling my stated wish in January 2018 to read more about this awesome character. I feel like anyone who feels like an outsider or is on the autism spectrum can identify with Murderbot's discomfort with eye contact and human interaction and desire to just hide away from the world and engage in introverts' entertainment. I've been busy collecting all six books in the series from three different libraries this past week so I could binge them all before the end of the year and was more than happy to reread this first one to reorient myself. This time I read it in a day and loved it every bit as much as the first time. The characters wouldn't be out of place in a Becky Chambers books, they're so delightfully humane.

Every time I come back to these books, I love Murderbot more and identify with them more! Just brilliant. Original review: An odd little book. I really liked the concept and character of Murderbot and I want to read more about it, but something about the book overall felt unfinished or incomplete. I wanted more detail on this world and the people in it - although I appreciate that we are following Murderbot's PoV and it mostly doesn't care! I don't know quite what I feel about this book, but I will probably take a look at the sequel when it comes out. In someways, it feels more like a pitch for a tv series (which I would totally binge watch), rather than a book in its own right. Re-read Oct 19 on audio: Really enjoyed revisiting this 1st instalment of Murderbot & v excited for the first full length novel to come out! Wasn't thrilled by the narration. There were a few minor errors and a few mispronounced words (a tear in someone's clothes was pronounced like they were crying rather than they'd damaged their outfit), but nothing major. I think it's more me than the narrator or the recording. Having listened to a dozen or so audiobooks now, I'm starting to this I just prefer an English narrator to an American one, but studies are on-going."}

That's right, the snarkiness brought to you by John Scalzi and his clones as a substitute for character development doesn't have to stop at witty rejoinders. Now you can get a steady stream of it all book long, in this case courtesy of a Murderbot, which is a Security Robot with a troubled past. It's probably the 'bot character that is causing this brief flurry of irrationally exuberant popularity here at GR. That, and the snarkiness, which is like being dipped into the mind of a sulky teenage girl, but with 100% less Justin Bieber references. Said snarkiness is brought on by the 'bot achieving self-awareness but choosing to watch Netflix and muse snarky thoughts about nearby adults all day instead of going full Skynet. Everybody knows you never go full Skynet. The story is nothing special, but it moves along at a relatively brisk pace, and Wells' color-by-numbers prose is adequate for maximum snarkiness delivery.

It wasn\u2019t what I expected,but still an entertaining ride for sure. The murderbot,an A.I.,who is on a mission with a crew of people as a SecUnit,to protect them,was pretty awesome as a character. It was surprisingly reletable. The way it hated interacting with people,being the centre of attention,and basically just wanted to be left alone to watch shows - I mean,that\u2019s pretty much me. The character development of the murderbot was well written,it was fascinating to see it change and start to actually care. But that\u2019s about it. The rest of the characters didn\u2019t stand out.

{"username":"Peter","date":1517961600000,"review_text":"I'm not sure if I should be worried when one of the most relatable protagonists I've read in a long time is technically a robot... Being set in an unknown future on some far off planet, this book follows a security robot that managed to hack itself. The premise is simple, yet effective, and we end up with an interesting protagonist who we follow very closely. Despite its relatively short length, this book does a great job of building up and even developing the main character who embodies certain qualities I suspect resonate with most people (even if a fair few wouldn't like to admit the fact). Who wouldn't rather be relaxing in bed and watching serials instead of doing their job and interacting with people? :P The world is also surprisingly well developed for such a short story. It cleverly limits its focus to the immediate setting and only gives us information relevant to the plot. After having read quite a few long-winded fantasy and sci-fi books recently, this was a nice change. I especially enjoyed the tidbits we get about 'the company', with its unfortunately too familiar profit-centric approach to everything they do. The writing wasn't too bad either. The story was well structured, albeit with the consequence of being a tad simple and predictable. Most of the interactions between characters were well done and even though I thought there was a bit too much internal monologuing, I mostly enjoyed hearing the protagonist's thoughts. We ended up with quite a few questions remaining though, so I got a sense of incompleteness to the story, although that might be due to this being a series. Apart from the protagonist, the characters were quite generic. It's not that big of an issue in short books like this, but a little bit more development of those secondary characters would have easily gained this book another star. We didn't get much information regarding the antagonist in this book and I'm ok with that. I would have liked to know more about their motivations, but again, being so short, I understand why it was so limited. So there you have it. A good little sci-fi novella with an oddly likeable protagonist and a deceptively well-built world. Definitely an easy book to recommend, especially to people who already enjoy some sci-fi. I'll be keeping my eye out for the next book in the series. 1 like"}

Murderbot is clearly a hardcore introvert who is suffering from PTSD. From its point of view we get ruminations on free will and obligation, as well as honesty versus greed. The story itself is about an exoplanet survey expedition that is experiencing mysterious technical glitches... which leads to murder. Good thing their SecUnit has some experience in this matter.

It has personality and apparently loves to binge on episodic entertainment (TV shows?). Wells does a really good job with the supporting characters as well. Very diverse. Only last names are used so you like to keep track of the gender of characters, it is a little difficult to do with this one. I guess gender does not really matter. It was good.

Pretty quick to the action, check! On to the next novella? Check! ------------ All Systems Red is the first in a series of novellas titled The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells. Based on that kind of title who would have expected a story about a security robot that hacks it's own governing module so can watch tv all day instead of doing its job? I know I didn't. And boy was this story great fun. Sometime in the future, the Company approves and supplies all planetary missions. As standard procedure all teams are accompanied by Company provided security androids, called SecUnits, a regulatory 1 android per 10 humans. On a distant planet, a research team is conducting surveys of the surface. Sure, there have been strange computer glitches from time to time, all perfectly normal considering programming contracts tend to go to the lowest bidder. That is right up until a neighboring mission goes dark and the scientists are determined to find out what happened. Clocking in at just over 150 pages, Wells does an impressive job. The plot takes off immediately, with the researchers and Murderbot finding themselves in a highly dangerous situation they never expected. On top of that she weaves in great characterization for Murderbot. Being an android who is finds dealing with humans uncomfortable and slightly annoying, preferring instead just watch them on tv, it's highly relatable to anyone who was an awkward teen growing up or just on those days when you'd rather not deal with people. Though Murderbot tries to come across as apathetic, I think it does care underneath it all. The downside to having such limited space is the rest of the characters aren't nearly so fleshed out. That's ok though since this is Murderbot's story. Well written and entertaining, this was a satisfying short read. d-j-reads fbr read-in-2018 ...more 7 likes 2 comments"}

{"username":"Tani","date":1594512000000,"review_text":"I've been in a bit of reading slump lately, feeling too constrained by own goals to even want to read most of the time. So, I decided to try something different. I watch quite a bit of Booktube, and the shortlist for the Booktube SFF awards just went up, so I'm going to take a break from my normal stuff and try to read a bunch of stuff for this! It will make it to so much more fun to engage with Booktube, and I rarely read any new releases, so I thought this would be a fun idea. Anyway, All Systems Red is a Booktube SFF Award nominee, so I thought I'd pick it up first. I've heard a ton about it, and I really expected to enjoy it, so it came as no surprise to me when I did! If you've heard about this novella at all, I'm sure you've heard of Murderbot, the SecUnit who just wants to watch dramas all day. And yes, the character of Murderbot is just as fantastic as you've heard. I think that Wells really gave readers a lot of connect with in Murderbot, and that's why the novella has been so successful. What I haven't heard mentioned as much is the supporting cast, who I also enjoyed very much. They don't get fleshed out anywhere near as much as Murderbot, but they're all good people, and it was nice to see a story populated with characters trying to do the right thing, even when they have different ideas about what the right thing is. The plot is fairly straightforward. There's a bit of a mystery about why the mission is being sabotaged, and then there's a bit of action as they figure out just what is going on. I like that, even though Murderbot claims to have little education in most things, it thinks for itself and tries to do a good job. I also liked the little information that we get about the world and the companies that are in charge, as well as the societal commentary that comes through. I was a little disappointed in the ending, mostly because I wanted something warm and squishy that just wouldn't have been in character to have actually happen. So, my fault for wanting to put on my rose-colored glasses, rather than a fault of the story. I am greatly looking forward to the next in the series, though.

{"username":"Tizzy Tizzy","date":1518307200000,"review_text":"I'm in love with Murderbot. And for that alone I can't recommend this novel enough. I've read several of Martha Wells books before. I ran into The Books of the Raksura while browsing Amazon for some fantasy and the illustration (it's always the illustration) caught my eye and ended up reading most of the series (I believe I never read the last book,) not just for the storyline (which was quite good I recall,) but because the setting was amazing. In All Systems Red, Wells takes a different direction. The setting this time around feels rather generic, but the main character more than makes up for it. Murderbot, a genderless robot whose job is to protect a group of humans in an alien planet, is easily the best MC I've read in a long while. Funny, at times philosophical, and always lazy it's Murderbot's narrative what gives this book a soul. Who would have thought having a lazy, uninteresting, rather reluctant hero who would rather be alone watching TV serials would have as a result such an entertaining book? (Martha Wells, that's who. She wrote the book, after all.) I don't think I can say much more about the book beyond praising Murderbot. This is because the storyline, while far from boring, was (for me) not the driving force of the novel. Without spoiling it, it's a part-mystery where Murderbot's humans are getting attacked in an environment that's supposed to be friendly and, while it touches on some interesting philosophical issues, I felt it was not the center here. I would even dare say this would be a rather dull book weren't it for its MC and the impressive way Mrs. Wells wrote it. So my final take here is: If you're looking for an enthralling adventure filled with political intrigue, plot twists, and action scenes, this is absolutely not your book. But if you're willing to look past the story itself and see this book as what it is \u2014a masterclass in how character development done well can be more than enough to keep a whole novel afloat \u2014 then read this book.

{"username":"Morgan Dhu","date":1518480000000,"review_text":"Martha Wells\u2019 novella All Systems Red: The Murderbot Diaries is the story of a cybernetic Security Unit that has hacked into its own programming, rendering it capable of autonomous thought and decision-making, although it has most definitely not entertained the notion of letting its employers know about that. It\u2019s designed to be a killing machine, and we see just how good it is at its function in the opening sequence, in which it saves teo human scientists from something large and nasty that attacks them. But what it really enjoys is consuming entertainment media - films, books, music. It\u2019s current contract is to provide security for a group of scientists surveying an uninhabited planet. As contracts go, it\u2019s not a bad one. The scientists are a reasonably compatible group who have worked together before, and after sll, it\u2019s not as if they want to socislise with their SecUnit - and their SecUnit definitely does not want to socialise with them. But after the incident with the large and aggressive lifeform, the SecUnit and the survey team have a serious problem. There\u2019s no mention of the lifeform in the official papers on the planet - and closer inspection shows that those documents have been altered. And that\u2019s just the beginning of the problems. This could have been your standard semi-milsf mystery thriller, and it certainly has all the elements necessary for that, but the unique voice of the narrator transforms it into something rather more interesting, a speculation on the nature of choice, responsibility and autonomy. The self-named \u201cmurderbot\u201d has free will, and is not particularly fond of human beings. Yet it risks itself to save its employers, repeatedly. A sense of duty? The need to hide its ability to make decisions, a sort if ironic self-preservation? A sense of right snd wrong? All Systems Red is entertaining as an action-adventure style sf story, but it\u2019s also an interesting turn on the classic AI examination. What is self-awareness? What is free will? What does an autonomous being that has none of the human drives do when it\u2019s left to its own choices? Wells has more stories panned in the Murderbot series planned, and I\u2019ll be interesting in seeing where she takes this. 1 like"}

Largely because most their free offering I've read (attempted to read) were tedious, pretentious shite. As in, there's a reason it was the free book of the month. This wasn't free and it cost more than I'd like to pay for a novella. But I liked the first book in Well's Raksura series, and the first page of this story instantly drew me in. The story begins with the protagonist, a SecUnit, explaining that it has turned off its governor module and is now free to run amuck and \"Kill all teh humans!\" Except, it's downloaded a shit-ton of entertainment programming from the net and and would much rather watch its shows all day. SecUnit is contracted to a group of scientist\/explorers who are conducting a survey of a new, possibly habitable planet. Our not-so-intrepid robot hero's soap opera viewing is interrupted when a team member gets attacked by a huge, rock worm thing. This event serves to demonstrate to SecUnit's human charges that it isn't an unfeeling machine but a compassionate, sentient being. Much to SecUnit's chagrin. See, SecUnit is an introvert who'd prefer to neither be seen nor heard. When the team discovers that their habitat computer has been hacked by a mysterious entity that has killed another survey team and is coming for them, SecUnit's desires to just be left alone come into conflict with its desire to keep its humans alive. SecUnit possesses just the right amount of alien robotic strangeness juxtaposed against very human emotions and angst. And a dry sense of humor. Like Sea of Rust's Brittle, SecUnit is one of the more human and engaging protagonists that I've read in a long time. Another plus was the story's brevity. While some novellas don't sufficiently develop narrative or characterization, All System's Red is the perfect length. Fast-paced, fun and charmingly compelling.

Murderbot (it's own name for itself) knows it's a robot, not a person. In fact, it doesn't even like people much. So it says... It turns out, Murderbot is human in every way that matters. It cares about people, and more to the point, it cares deeply how people feel about Murderbot. It also cares deeply about electronic entertainment. I kept wanting to tell Murderbot to get a life: or as my mother would have said, \"Why don't you just go outside and play?\" At least one reviewer used non-binary gender pronouns [they, them, etc.] throughout to refer to Murderbot, and I'm okay with that, but I don't think in this case, and for this novella it's actually appropriate, because Murderbot thinks of itself as an \"it\" (pointing out that it can't have a sex, because only sex-bots are made with genitalia). Perhaps in the second and third installments, coming out later in 2018, Murderbot's own opinion of its humanity may change... sf 8 likes 4 comments"}

I really enjoyed the voice of MurderBot - they are so snarky and has the most dry sense of humor. They is also suffering form social anxiety when dealing with humans, so they hides in media consumption. They feel like a giant geek - it's wonderful. The human clients are also pretty great. The book is very much about free will, when the people around you don't see you as human and have convicted you to dehumanize yourself. The plot is moving along at a high clip but I was very much there for MurderBot's commentary on the situations, more than the situations. Can we please hang out in a caf\u00e9 and you can hide in your helmet and comment on people? I would love to hear from someone with social anxiety how they feel about MurderBot - it seems a bit problematic that we get a cyborg with the issue, and no humans with any kind of mental of physical disability, however the potrail does feel real and authentic - but what do I know - I don't have that kind anxiety. The book is so crazy quotable - I found my self wanting to post huge chunks of it on social media - highlighting lots of it on my kindle. _novella 2018 sci-fi 2 likes"}

{"username":"Hannah","date":1519344000000,"review_text":"I had so much fun reading this short little novella. I needed something quick and easy to read after Leviathan Wakes, and this just fit the bill. It is snarky and witty and surprisingly well-rounded. Our main character and point of view is Murderbot, as it likes to call itself. It is working security for a group of explorers when things start to go sideways. Murderbot is the clear focus of this book and rightfully so: it is hilarious in its pessimism and sympathetic in its apathy. Its arc was (mostly) believable and I loved seeing the world from its point of view. (Aside: I was picturing Murderbot as female and kept thinking of it as such until I read reviews\u2026 and realized it is never called thus; the humans in this book refer to Murderbot as it, and so does it itself. I don\u2019t know what that says about me but I found it fairly fascinating to think about my biases. If you have read the novella, please do let me know whether you thought of Murderbot as female or male. The audiobook narrator is a man fyi.) I enjoyed how fast-paced this was and how much kept happening. Martha Wells did not waste a single page of this book which is something I am really appreciating about novellas at the moment. I have already pre-ordered the next books in the series (they will all be coming out later this year) and cannot wait to see where Martha Well takes her story next.

{"username":"Marco","date":1562889600000,"review_text":"A very entertaining novella, impossible to put down, written from the eyes of one of the most interesting characters I have seen in a while: an organic android, deprived of any legal right, yet completely human and full of mirth. The story is short, and there was not space yet for a lot of character development, but there are promising premises and signs... I cannot wait to read the next installments of the series. In a corporate-dominated space-faring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn't a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied android, a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \"Murderbot\". Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. sci-fi"}

It likes the human crew it\u2019s assigned to protect but feels awkward and shy about interacting with the humans socially. The science expedition is busy with expedition duties when a neighboring expedition disappears from communications. That\u2019s the whole story. So the heart of the story is the SecUnit (which calls itself Murderbot) dealing with human interaction in crisis and non-crisis settings.

{"username":"Milou","date":1568160000000,"review_text":"This is going to be a short and sweet review of a book which was just that. Usually I am not a fan of novellas. I often have the feeling that the story the author is trying to tell is too big for the amount of pages, resulting in the reader feeling like he is missing information or that the story is rushed. This wasn't the case for this novella. It was just the right length. It also has a good ending, so that even though it is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone. The opening was perfect. It manages to very effectively set the scene, introduce the main character and draw the reader in from the get go. I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satelites. It has been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. I really enjoyed the main character, Murderbot. Even though it is very explicitly stated that Murderbot doesn't have a sex, the reader cannot help to stop calling it an 'it' from very early on. I have noticed it differs per reader if it is a he or a she though. Nonetheless, he\/she feels very much like a real person, even though it is a bot. The plot is simple, the writing is direct, there is a healthy dose of humour and snarkyness, and the pacing is good. Overall, this was a very nice, light and short SF read. Definitely recommend picking this one up. 10 likes"}

Normally i would not find this to be a big issue, however the book is 150 pages long and cost about $4, which is not expensive since its novella sized. However upon looking into potentially reading the remainder of the series i found that all books are about 150 pages, the price however jumped to 13$ for each book, which is just way to much for novella sized books. My tip to the author, if you make books the size of a novella then also charge the price of them, and not this silly price i pay normally for books at least 4x the amount of pages."}

I mean, sure, it was kind of fun but I had higher expectations with the hype. Yeah, the hype monster might have killed this for me. But honestly, let's look at it. While the narrative perspective of the security robot who does not want to be what it is but rather watch soap opera and calls itself 'Murderbot' is truly what drives this novella and gives it a special something edge but the plot is not really anything spectacular. I was actually surprised by how fluffy it turned out. The additional cast is highly underdeveloped (they blurred for me) which might come from the length, I thought this likely should have been a fleshed out novel and it pains me to say that since I loved novellas and want there to be more good ones published in print but I felt this needed more to work for me. There are some tropes I don't care for, for example towards the climax our Murderbot has an idea to help, then we cut to the next and withhold that idea from the reader to then slowly unfold. In a first person narration I consider that a lazy way of creating suspense and don't like when writers do that. Also, I need to comment on the humor, I think this is meant to be rather funny but whenever I came across a 'funny' line I thought a more humorous writer would have pulled the punchline of, most comedic elements fizzled out for me, I could notice them but never found them all that great. Like the soap watching thing, it was kind of cute at first but the more mentioned the more it lost in appeal. Anywho, while I think the concept is better than the execution I am clearly alone in that. So many eat this up and claim it is good, for me it came out as a okay and I will not be continuing with the series. I don't read much Sci-Fi, I read a lot of dystopias and apocalyptic things, also speculative fiction is in my rotation but not the real set in space stuff, maybe that was my issue, that it just is not my thing? 2.5* read-in-2018 singles space-fiction 2 likes 2 comments"}

{"username":"Alan","date":1519344000000,"review_text":"Based on the high reviews and what sounded like a stellar concept, I was expecting to fall in love with this book, but unfortunately it was a disappointment. There's nothing \"wrong\" with the writing, particularly, or with the story and its characters. Rather, there simply isn't much to either the novella's characters or plot. Throughout the book I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading only a sliver of a story that needed much more expansion to feel complete. While the book is part of a series, I'm not sure I can forgive the book these flaws, since it never felt fleshed out in its own right. The issue was never that the book wasn't a standalone (in a strange, seemingly contradictory way, it does stand alone), but instead that the narrative simply feels unfinished. If you're looking for a book that deals with artificial intelligence in a meaningful way, with fleshed-out characters and world building, I recommend looking elsewhere. The concept is all over science fiction, and has been executed much more satisfyingly by many more authors. Perhaps, once the series is complete, and it's released in a combined edition it may work better as a story, but the cynical part of me sees this as a simple cash-grab on the part of the publisher (this book is also very expensive considering its length and the quality of the printing, and were one to purchase each of the reported four installments that's upwards of a hundred Canadian dollars for one normal-length book). I don't blame the author at all, rather this read like one in another of a trend of publishing novellas and short stories as \"novels\" and upping the price for readers. Lots of flash, and attractive to modern readers on the go for its size and length, but lacking in any depth or creativity."}

They are a bit different from most of the Company SepcUnits becuase they have modified themselves to take out the control that the Company and the humans have over them, but they know that this is incredibly dangerous for them and so they have to keep this hidden and just pretend to still be functioning as they should. I really liked the character of Murderbot as it's really quite a grump when it comes to humanity and it's quite cynical about our kind. I enjoyed the inner monologues and pessimistic outlook a lot more than I expected, becuase a snarky but witty robot is always something worth reading about. This is the story of a team on a new planet who are conducting research but whilst they are there they are interrupted by an attack and Murderbot has to rescue some of them. Quickly it comes to light that the attack may not have just been chance, and we follow the team as they try (with Murderbot's help) to uncover what really went on and who is acting against them...

{"username":"Patty","date":1519776000000,"review_text":"A sci-fi novella (only 80 pages long), the first in the \"Murderbot\" series. Murderbot, as our first-person narrator calls itself, is a 'SecUnit', a Security Unit robot\/cyborg\/android\/whatever composed of both organic and mechanical parts, with an inbuilt connection to various internet and local networks. It's also hacked its own system to become an independent operator. Rather than going wild and murdering any nearby humans, it continues to do its security job, though in a halfassed way so it can return more quickly to watching the galactic equivalent of Netflix: Confession time: I don't actually know where we are. We have, or are supposed to have, a complete satellite map of the planet in the survey package. That was how the humans decided where to do their assessments. I hadn't looked at the maps yet and I'd barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we'd been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn't had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care. Murderbot has currently been outsourced to a team of scientists investigating a planet for potential natural resource extraction. It's all normal and boring until they notice some areas are missing from their maps. And then a few more things go wrong. Is it because they bought a cheap survey package? Is it sabotage? And if someone is trying to kill them, who and why? Murderbot starts to realize that maybe it does care after all \u2013 at least about these humans and at least a bit. I absolutely loved this book. Reading it flew by. Murderbot's narration is hilarious, its voice and perspective are genuinely different from a human's in interesting ways, and I adored the resolution of the plot. I can't recommend this highly enough, and I can't wait to read the sequels. read-in-2018 science-fiction-fantasy"}

{"username":"Elle (ellexamines on TT & Substack)","date":1553990400000,"review_text":"\u201cI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,00 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\u201d These novellas are a story of what it means to be human, and a story of the human tendency to create a group that is less than human. Featuring a sarcastic and antisocial protagonist, an intriguing world, and all the morality issues I needed. [This review will function as a full review for the series.] This novella seriess dabbles really explicitly with the idea of being human and trying not to be human. Murderbot lives in a world where it cannot be considered fully human, and as a result, it shuts itself off from other humans and tries to avoid group dynamics altogether. And as a result, I love the character of Murderbot so much and I\u2019m going to rant about this. Something I like about this series is that Murderbot is written as a powerful killing machine and actually... is. Murderbot is really competent at what they do, but not in an unrealistic way? I feel like a lot of lies I read in fiction are so obviously lies that anyone could guess it, but Murderbot just genuinely is talented at making lies sound real and knowing when to drop info and when to stay quiet. I love realistic badassery. But Murderbot also has this compulsory need to be above human attachment and act as if it does not have feeings. It totally does. The worldbuilding of this series is really fantastic especially as the series goes on! I talked about this more in my review for book two. But this series does definitely have very interesting worldbuilding, with a wide scope and heavy lens of environmentalism.

The story is part sci-fi, part mystery and part action\/adventure which make is a fun and engrossing read.

{"username":"Contrarius","date":1520726400000,"review_text":"I've heard lots of good things about this one, and I'm happy to say they are all true. (The following facts from the story are not spoilers -- everything I mention below is spelled out within the first few pages.) This is a pretty terrific novella about a biomechanical security-guard type of AI who calls itself Murderbot -- which should tell you right away that it isn't as dispassionately logical or detached as it would like to pretend or as others might see it. In this society this type of AI is treated as a tool, either rented out on contract or sold outright, and nobody pauses to consider that they could be anything more than robots -- but Murderbot has hacked the \"governor module\" that is supposed to control its behavior, so unbeknownst to anyone it is actually autonomous. It is never made clear (at least in the first installment) just how much (if any) human brain input it actually has (it has a human-appearing head, but we don't know what's inside that head), but Murderbot clearly has emotions -- and social anxiety, which is by turns both funny and touching. Martha Wells is always good with characters, and this one is no exception -- she does a great job of showing instead of telling, and of letting the character grow. I also liked the plot. Murderbot has been rented out on contract to a planetary survey team, and on the new planet things gradually start to go mysteriously wrong. Everyone on the team, including Murderbot, will have to work together, get inventive, and stretch far beyond their comfort zones in order to figure out what's going on, and to survive until rescue can arrive. There's never a dull moment, and though at times the human characters seem too nice to be true, their interactions with Murderbot are great -- and I especially loved how Murderbot's reactions to them changed over time. This novella has been getting a lot of Hugo buzz, and I can see why. I'm certainly going to put it on my nomination ballot. And even the Puppies, if they hadn't already run away from further attempts to manipulate Hugo results, couldn't have much objection to its tone -- sure, there are some Evil People at work, but over all it is really quite optimistic and uplifting in its outlook about both humans and AIs. If you've enjoyed any of Wells's other books, read it. If you enjoy AI-more-human-than-you'd-think stories, read it. I'll certainly be reading the next installment. I'm giving this about 4.4 stars and rounding down -- I might give it all 5 stars if we had more of the story instead of this being broken up into novella-sized pieces. science-fiction 1 like"}

{"username":"Bruna","date":1567382400000,"review_text":"This was surprisingly sweet. It is also weird that I relate so much to someone called Murderbot, but there is that. This novella packs quite a punch for a short work: We are introduced to this modern universe, set sometime in the future where humans explore and live in many different planets and have also technologies to create part machine and part organic clone creatures who serve as guards for hire. Most of the world is a capitalist dystopia in which everything is controlled by The Company, including those guards, also called SecUnits. But our main character is a self aware SecUnit who calls itself (they don't have a gender) Murderbot, likes to watch tv shows (or serials) and would really prefer not to be bother by humanity, though they would do pretty much anything to protect their humans. Murderbot was set to protect these humans anyway, but since hacking its operational module, it doesn't have to. Needless to say, I am Murderbot and Murderbot is me. Relating to the character was a great part of the enjoyment of this story. I liked how it has a theme of self discovery and independence of thought as well as friendships and how they can help us come into ourselves, but ultimately we must do our self assessments on our own. I do wish we had more world building and the plot itself wasn't that special or memorable, but I am curious to see where the story and Murderbot go next! I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. adult audiobook read-march-2018 ...more"}
{"username":"Carsten Friedrich","date":1654128000000,"review_text":"The main character is refreshingly idiosyncratic, and, I found, surprisingly likeable, and the premise of the story is also quite interesting. It is rather short though. While this is not a problem in itself, it does however mean there is little room for character development; also the story is rather straight forward with little complexity or interesting turns. Still, overall I liked it and would recommend it."}
{"username":"Reading Cat","date":1520985600000,"review_text":"Really fun little book--way too short, of course, but that's a good thing in some cases, where you just want so much more of the world, the characters, and everything. One minor critique: author uses 'hack' in Hollywood fashion--with the subtlety of a hatchet, as a magic handwave 'does something to computers', rather indiscriminately, which is a let down from Well's usual care in worldbuilding.

{"username":"Stephanie Jones","date":1520985600000,"review_text":"Oh goodness, that was excellent. A misanthropic \"security unit\" robot has hacked its own governor and gone rogue. BUT, instead of killing all humans, it becomes a massive consumer of entertainment media. It barely does its job protecting humans on a little-known planet from large native fauna just so it can get back to its favorite show without suspicion or interference. When the surveyors it protects runs into problems, it is forced to interact with them, and it is SO AWKWARD and SO AMAZING. The robot calls itself \"murderbot\" and clearly has no idea how to interact socially, and in fact, really doesn't care enough to try. That would, after all, get in the way of watching more television. favorites scientist-centric 2 likes"}
{"username":"Gerchia","date":1521072000000,"review_text":"3\/5 - 4 Stars. A story of the Spirit Bot of our age. A fast paced little book about a rogue Murderbot. The plot of this novella was intriguing and solid enough. The world building and general left me wanting more. But really, it's Murderbot that sold it for me. I have to admit, it took me a couple of tries to get into the story in the beginning. But once I got a sense for Murderbot as a character I just fell in love. Murderbot is my Spirit Animal. Relatably snarky and pessimistic to the core. Loving books, movies and all things entertainment and just wanting to be left the fxck alone. The technology behind what makes up the physiology of theUnit is also very interesting and very sci-heavy. How can I not squee in glee and laugh out loud when It does and reacts to things. So although the story is really good. It's Murderbot that makes it just so much better. Hopefully everything will be fully explained in the other books.

The same kind of unique which makes The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\u2019s robots unique\u2026 they have *some* feelings. That conceit makes this book an absolute joy to read. It not really about the action on screen, it\u2019s more about the quiet moments in between. The interactions. After reading I Robot, I can sense that same freshness of thought. It shares a lot of DNA with a lot of stories from Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, but you can tell it\u2019s written by a woman. It has more emotional depth than both those authors. It is also refreshing to read a story from a female perspective. Likewise violence always seems to shatter the moment. It\u2019s not glorified, but rather something to push through and then recover from, rather than celebrate. The book is short and I wish their was more of it to explore, but as there are more books in the pipeline, I can\u2019t wait to rejoin our intrepid murderbot on her journey."}
{"username":"Amy (I'd Rather Be Sleeping)","date":1632182400000,"review_text":"So, I actually liked this less the second time around than I did the first time. More of a 2 stars now. My biggest problem is the main character, Murderbot. When I'm stuck in the head of someone that doesn't want to do anything, - including their job - admits to not caring about anything, it's an uphill battle for me to care about them. To no ones great shock, I like the secondary characters much more than the main character (much like my feels for The Cloud Roads by Martha Wells and everything to do with Moon) but\u2026well, if you've read the book you know why this doesn't help my issue. Look, I read books to be entertained, not read about someone that wants to, literally, watch TV all day. (I do have the second book checked out from the library, and I intend to read it in the next couple of weeks then go from there if I'll continue the series.) Original Review I went back and forth so many times on the rating for this book. I mean, it took me a good thirty pages (of an already short book) before I settled in to the writing style. It seems rather jerky and abrupt at first, but I'm assuming that was a style choice. (And also a side effect of the first person narrative that, really, was quite necessary, even if I don't usually care for it. And a byproduct of me not being able to picture ANY of the characters.) Then things picked up and we got moving and I sighed in relief that this would be another great Wells read for me. (My expectations probably did this book no favors.) But, then I reached the last page - almost literally - and was rather unhappy with the ending. I mean, I understand why Murderbot did that, but that's not what I wanted to see happen. So...I think I'll probably catch up on the rest of Wells books before I come back to this series. 4 likes"}

{"username":"Colin Murtagh","date":1521331200000,"review_text":"I'd heard a lot of this novella, and wasn't sure what to make of it, but it's short so I thought it was worth a try. I'm glad I did. Planet exploration is controlled now by the Company. Any exploratory team though must be accompanied by security units. Part flesh, mainly robotic, heavily armoured and armed, these units are designed to protect the explorers. And it help keeps the insurance rates down. Just to be on the safe side, all SecUnits are equipped with governor units to ensure that they obey, protect and serve. Meet Murderbot, a SecUnit that somehow has managed to bypass his governor unit, but is more interested in keeping up with his soap-operas than he is in virtually anything else. As part of one of two teams exploring a new planet, this should be a fairly routine mission, however things start to take a weird turn, and with the sudden disappearance of the second group, he know has to try and protect his charges, and get them off planet before disaster hits them. I really rather enjoyed this, its past paced, proper thriller writing, but with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. There's a couple of deficiencies, strangely enough the Murderbot comes off as the most \"human\" of the characters, the team he's protecting just aren't particularly well characterised, which means you're looking for him to survive, the rest of them, not so much. He's got a lot of inner monologue, which comes across as particularly cynical and sharp, but it just makes him a more rounded character. For a bot designed to protect humans, he doesn't seem to like them much. The ending is to me particularly disappointing, it doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book but saying that, this is supposed to be a 4 book series, which means it does set up the next book nicely. All in a strong start to a series I will be following. crime fiction science-fiction ...more"}

{"username":"Grace","date":1521417600000,"review_text":"This review originally appeared on my blog, Books Without Any Pictures: http:\/\/bookswithoutanypictures.com\/20... All Systems Red is the first book in the series The Murderbot Diaries. And really, the word murderbot is what made me pick up this book. It just *sounds* like the kind of thing I\u2019d want to read. Luckily, my instinct was correct, and All Systems Red did not disappoint. The story is set in outer space. Space exploration is regulated by corporations, and those corporations are cheap and want to cut as many corners as possible so they can make lots and lots of money. When a group of explorers goes on a mission, the corporation makes them rent a SecUnit (security unit), an android made partially with cloned human parts, in order to protect (but mostly spy on and collect data from) the explorers. The main character of this story is a SecUnit that\u2019s hacked its governor module and gone rogue. It doesn\u2019t want the humans to find out, because then it would be taken apart for scrap or would have another governor module installed, and that would mean the end of its freedom. Really, Murderbot (that\u2019s what it calls itself in private) just wants to spend some quality time watching the many many many hours of soap operas that it downloaded. The thought of socializing with humans, who both fear and pity it, isn\u2019t at all appealing. But of course, life isn\u2019t that easy. Someone is sabotaging the mission, and if the humans are going to survive, they\u2019re going to have to work together with the newly rogue Murderbot to do so. I really liked the way that Murderbot is characterized throughout the story, because the author makes it very clear that even though Murderbot thinks like a person and has emotions, it isn\u2019t a human at all. Murderbot has no gender, because it wasn\u2019t built with any sexual parts or characteristics. It doesn\u2019t hold grudges against the corporation or humans in general, because holding grudges is a very human thing to do. True, it has many human feelings and characteristics, but it\u2019s also very much a robot. It doesn\u2019t feel comfortable interacting with humans because humans either treat it with revulsion or try to humanize it, and the latter is extremely awkward for everyone involved precisely because it isn\u2019t human. Murderbot is its own thing and doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any of the boxes you try to put it in. It\u2019s an alien consciousness that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, and now it\u2019s trying to figure out its place in the world. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of this series. All Systems Red was a grand adventure, and I can\u2019t wait to see what Murderbot will do with itself next. 1 like"}

Overall Takeaway: I think my review for this book might have a higher word count than the book itself! That being said, I thought this was a fun, lighthearted read (not something I thought I'd say for a book called Murderbot Diaries!). Murderbot was a very funny protagonist and I loved every time the humans would have a whispered conversation about \"respecting Its privacy\" and how horrified that would make It! The whole concept was really hilarious -what's a Murderbot to do when the humans start wanting to know how It feels about everything?! Definitely a fun and silly space romp, but way too short for me to fully get into it. Just as Murderbot and the humans were beginning to grow on me, the story was over! The mystery isn't very mysterious, and the ending was pretty surprising, and not in a good way -I felt like Murderbots actual feelings and goals weren't clearly conveyed in a way that made the ending come together. However, I still found the book very funny and generally a great short story! 1 like"}
{"username":"Jeanette","date":1521504000000,"review_text":"This read was short and delicious. Murderbot is the narrator. And he (I took him as a he since- his liking of inconsequential sit. com. type t.v. fare and action series tipped the scale for me in that direction; yes, I guess that is a prejudicial judgment). He is a SecBot. A security robot. But he does have organic parts. The entire story just entertained me to the max. Loved it. Adored the way he thought, and his self-knowledge concerning his own \"I don't care\" factions, especially those which related to his job performance and obedience % proclivities. This truly entices me to read others of hers. Because this author sure knows humans. Others speak of our hero's snark. I don't feel like it is snark at all, in fact quite the opposite. He truly doesn't want to be other than what he is and that is not a stand up comic or anything whatsoever that has to be of central focus or individual scrutiny. So I thought the ending was superb. Exactly how it should have went and usually doesn't. Even if you dislike most si. fi. I still highly rec. this one. I just wish it had been longer.

{"username":"Monty","date":1522022400000,"review_text":"Quick and enjoyable sci fi read recounted first person from the viewpoint of security droid that calls itself Murderbot. He is the product of a company which hires him out to protect interplanetary scientific and mining expeditions. He was fabricated using cheap materials and faulty software which failed on a previous assignment and sent him on a killing spree. Too expensive to be trashed, he was removed from service and updated with new software, which he has learnt to over-ride. His preference is to immerse himself in the entertainment data instead of his security detail which he completes in thorough albeit cursory manner. The subsequent internal conflict between droid programming and the increasing empathy with his human charges is handled with humour albeit awkwardly. The faltering hesitant interaction between Muderbot and the crew he is assigned to protect develops as their lives are placed in danger. I was reminded of the similar conflicts experienced by Murphy played by Peter Weller in the movie Robocop #1 and Robert Mason's warrior droid in his novel \"Solo.

You may not understand everything, but you just gotta roll with it until it soaks in. She succeeds very well at 'show, don't tell'. And while the process of getting used to her world is on going, she secures the reader's loyalty and interest by making them attached with her characters. And then she makes slaves of us all. (Just kidding) (I think it doesn't hurt that there's the subtlest application of whump to the characters to make people like me want to hug them forever. The murderbot seems to be about as rash as Moon about getting injured, and we know how I feel about Moon.) I'm still pretty confused about the world in this series but I'm sure I'll get to know more about it soon enough. For now, I have my affection for a murderbot who just likes to binge watch TV shows.

{"username":"Sankara Jayanth S","date":1703980800000,"review_text":"What an entertaining read. A robot trained to kill hostile fauna on alien planets while working alongside human exploration teams is the narrator. And what a character this robot, which calls itself a Murderbot, is. Murderbot hacks the governor module present in its system, essentially allowing it to decide whether to obey the commands sent by the clients who hired it, the choice which it would not have if the module had been operational. The premise is utterly intriguing. And the first few lines of the book promise a great story and an entertaining tone for it. And the author delivers those promises. I COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\u2019t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. So this Murderbot uses all spare time it can get to watch sitcoms and entertainment content, despising human interaction and its job. I had thoroughly enjoyed reading this, not just because of the POV of the story or the tone of it, but also because of the story it had to offer. I was skeptical about the plot because how good would a plot be where the main character is a funny and brooding killing robot, but I was pleasantly surprised by how intense the story was. The action scenes and the suspense was so good, brief moments though they were. The plot gets a tad too contrived in the end for my liking, but this is a complaint I seem to be making for almost every book I read these days, so it wasn't that big a deal truly. I think people who are looking for something refreshing in terms of POV and story should read this, it's short and awesome. lesser-known-books sci-fi 9 likes 2 comments"}

Time to change it. All Systems Red has an interesting premise - On a distant planet, a team of scientists is conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied \u2018droid \u2014 a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself as \u201cMurderbot.\u201d Despite this name, there's not much mayhem in the book. Actually, Murderbot is mostly interested in binge-watching shows on entertainment feeds. Fates of fictional characters are more important to it than the fates of scientist team she's supposed to protect. Unfortunately, it seems there's sort of a sabotage and lives are at stakes. Murderbot will have to make few important decisions. The story is told from the first-person perspective of a Murderbot. It seems people tend to enjoy her snarky narration. Personally, I couldn't connect to her \/ its voice. There's a serious lack of character and character development. The team of scientists is barely sketched, at times it's difficult to keep track of different characters as most of them have absolutely no personality. \u201cConfession time: I don\u2019t actually know where we are. We have, or are supposed to have, a complete satellite map of the planet in the survey package. That was how the humans decided where to do their assessments. I hadn\u2019t looked at the maps yet and I\u2019d barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we\u2019d been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn\u2019t had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn\u2019t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don\u2019t care. As you see Murderbot doesn't care much about her team and isn't interested in nuances of their behavior. As a result, we don't learn about it. Think of them as chess pieces. Mostly pawns. Overall, it's an interesting novella but because I couldn't connect to Murderbot's voice, my enjoyment was limited. sci-fi 14 likes"}

The start is captivating: I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.

As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. Murderbot is a Security Unit (SecUnit) for a group of surveyors. Basically, it's a mix of organic and non-organic material that functions as a bodyguard. Murderbot is considered non-human (an AI?). The researchers nearly get killed, and discover that some group is out to kill them. It's not a particularly original plot, but what makes it refreshing is the writing. I loved Murderbot - there are several scenes where it makes expressions and regrets it - and so it prefers to hide behind the faceplate, it hates interacting with humans (it prefers to ride in the cargo compartment rather than with the humans), it loves watching entertainment, and somehow it also aims to help its humans. I also loved the scene where the humans realise that Murderbot has a hacked governor module - and spends that time watching entertainment. The ending was also great - it felt like a culmination of what Murderbot has been working up towards. It felt clear that the humans felt something for Murderbot, considering their whispered conversations, but Murderbot didn't want anything to do with them. So it was great that Murderbot just seized its freedom and ran away. The last bits are particularly poignant too: I don't know what I want. I said that at some point, I think. But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me. That's why I left you, Dr. Mensah, my favourite human.

{"username":"Maddalena","date":1522972800000,"review_text":"My only encounter so far with Martha Wells\u2019 works has been through the first volume of her Tales of the Raksura series, an intriguing combination of fantasy and science fiction that somewhat defies genre definition, and one I intend to return to as soon as I can. I was therefore very curious to read this novella that promised to be quite different, since I enjoy seeing authors flex their proverbial writing muscles in different environments, and I can now say that All Systems Red was a very intriguing experience. On the surface, this novella looks like the deceptively straightforward story of a scientific team exploring an alien world that finds itself threatened by what looks like incorrect information and equipment failure, which is later revealed as an attempt to kill them all to prevent discovery of an unlawful operation. The team is assisted, as required by the Company \u2013 the corporate entity supervising every planetary survey \u2013 by a SecUnit, an armed and armored android tasked with their protection. This particular SecUnit, though, is different from the other Company-supplied bots, because it\u2019s been able to hack its own governor module, and therefore to act independently from any directive it receives. This mutinous act from the SecUnit, that calls itself Murderbot because of a previous incident, is what defines the whole narrative, taking it away from any predictable path and moving it in unexpected \u2013 and sometimes deliciously funny \u2013 directions. The story is relayed by Murderbot itself, and as unreliable a narrator as it seems to be, the android speaks in a delightfully cynical voice that sets the tone from the very start, since the SecUnit did not hack its governor module for any dark purpose: all it wants is to be independent from the Company\u2019s nagging presence, with its annoying updates and checks, and be free to enjoy the huge cache of serialized shows it downloaded for its own enjoyment. This is a surprisingly human desire (how many times have we wished to spend a day lounging in front of the tv, instead of having to go to work?), and it sets from the start the parameters for the android\u2019s personality, one that is revealed bit by bit during the course of the story and that manages to make Murderbot a very sympathetic character, one that\u2019s quite easy to root for. If on one side Murderbot is not very fond of humans and tries to avoid their company as much as its duties allow, it does so because of its underlying inability to understand them fully, and in the end its fixation with the serials it\u2019s so fond of might be a way to work toward that understanding through vicarious, less hands-on means. In a way I was reminded of a painfully shy adolescent trying to grasp the finer points of social intercourse by watching tv\u2026. What emerges from the fast-paced narrative is the progressive \u2013 and at times even unwilling \u2013 change in Murderbot\u2019s psychological profile, which is not so surprising with some hindsight: a bot whose higher aspiration is to be free of superior directives so it can indulge in soap-opera binges is far too human to remain a detached machine for long. Not that our character does not try: we learn soon enough that it feels uncomfortable in the company of humans, that the necessity to lower its visor and show them its face makes it extremely nervous and exposed, which made me wonder how much aware Murderbot is of its difference from the basic SecUnit models, and convinced me of its partial unreliability as a narrator. As the situation gets ever more dangerous for the science team, we see Murderbot change its attitude toward its humans \u2013 just as they change their own attitude toward it, accepting it as one of their own with surprising ease \u2013 so that it becomes not only their guard but their protector. The desire for freedom of choice, when paired with the need to safeguard the team\u2019s lives (and incidentally its own), morphs into the first inklings of free will, that at first manifests itself in the ability of thinking up a scheme for the group\u2019s survival and later becomes the desire\/necessity to explore this amazing changes without further external influence. It\u2019s a fascinating journey from many points of view: because of the construct\u2019s growing self-awareness, of course, but also thanks to Murderbot\u2019s peculiar voice that is an irresistible mix of snark and logical thinking, of innocence (as far as interpersonal relations go) and craftiness. It was a delight following the unit\u2019s journey, and I more than look forward to learning more in the upcoming novellas for this series, which I hope will also expand on the tantalizing details we just glimpsed about this future society.

I managed to blow through it in a few hours, which is unusual for me. But the pace was so fast and the story so intriguing that I couldn't stop for long without wanting to get back in and find out what happened next. The strength of this book is really Murderbot itself. The story is told from its perspective, and it's an interesting one. It's so convinced it's just a machine, continually reminding others, and trying very hard (it seems) to convince itself of that fact. But it has emotions and attachments, little quirks that make it evident that it's not just a robot. The pace was so quick, and the story managed to pack a lot of action into relatively few pages. I'm very glad that this is just the first book in a series, though, because the ending was kind of unsatisfying and a little confusing. I can't wait to find out what happens next in Murderbot's life (and will the poor thing ever get a proper name?).

You got just enough world building that everything made sense, but barely that and no more. Which I actually liked, for some reason. Crazy thing, the whole time, I pictured MurderBot as female. Yes, I know the book says it's gender neutral. But every scene, I pictured her female. When I looked to see how read the audiobook, it's a guy, and it made me think, did they ever say it looked more male or female? It didn't, but then why did I picture it so clearly as a female? No idea. I'm keeping my vision of her and can't wait to get to the next one!"}

{"username":"Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d","date":1549843200000,"review_text":"Feb. 2019 reread, just for fun! And to see if my rating would change now that I've read the full set of MURDERBOT DIARIES novellas (spoiler alert: it didn't, but I did enjoy this reread a little more than my initial read). All Systems Red won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novella, not to mention several other awards. There are (so far) three sequels and I loved them all! ... even more than this first book, truth be told, though maybe it just took me a while to really warm up to Murderbot. It's definitely a series that's worth reading, and this first book is just $3.99 for the Kindle version. Review posted on Fantasy Literature: The narrator of All Systems Red is a once-nameless cyborg security unit or SecUnit that has given itself the name Murderbot (for reasons disclosed midway through the story). Using its own unprecedented and highly unauthorized initiative, Murderbot has hacked the governor module software that controls its actions and obligates it to be obedient. But instead of going on a killing spree, as one might expect given the name it adopted, Murderbot elects to spend its spare hours watching countless hours of video entertainment and trying not to interact more than is necessary with the group of eight humans that it\u2019s responsible for protecting, a survey group of eight scientists called PreservationAux that is exploring the natural resources on an uninhabited planet. Murderbot\u2019s self-isolation and studied lack of caring starts to break down, however, when potentially deadly accidents start to occur with suspicious regularity. Dr. Bharadwaj is almost killed by an alien creature that explodes out of the bottom of one of the many craters along the coast, and the group finds that data has been deleted from the warnings and fauna sections of their planetary survey package. The autopilot of their \u201chopper\u201d aircraft cuts out without warning, which could have led to a fatal crash. And then there are the automated data updates that Murderbot is supposed to be uploading (and would have, if it hadn\u2019t disabled its governor module). Matters only get worse when the group decides to visit the only other survey group on the planet. Murderbot is painfully shy and vastly reluctant to get too close to the humans, and even more, to share their secrets. But it becomes clear that the group won\u2019t survive without Murderbot\u2019s help and active involvement. All Systems Red is a breezy, fast-paced science fiction adventure wrapped in a light mystery. There\u2019s not nearly as much murder and mayhem as the title and Murderbot\u2019s name might lead one to believe. Instead, All Systems Red has something serious to say about the ideas of free will and autonomy, and about the difficulties faced by introverts in day-to-day life. Murderbot tells itself that it just doesn\u2019t care about the humans, but its excruciating shyness soon becomes clear to the other characters and to the reader. Murderbot hides its human face behind helmet with an opaque faceplate, and awkwardly withdraws from conversations that become too personal, choosing to stand facing the wall instead. Murderbot comments that it has no gender or sex-related parts; claiming that only sexbots in brothels have those. Understandably, it has an asexual personality, another unique aspect to this main character. Murderbot fast-forwards through all of the sex scenes in the serials it watches, finding them boring (\u201cI think that even if I did have sex-related parts I would find them boring\u201d). Murderbot also narrates this novella with a large dose of snark: They had talked it over and all agreed not to \u201cpush me any further than I wanted to go\u201d and they were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. I can\u2019t do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans. \u2026 At least Mensah and Arada had overruled the ones who wanted to talk to me about it. Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful that I dropped to 97% efficiency. Murderbot is a unique, well-developed character but, other than the leader of the survey group, Dr. Mensah, and one other person who is somewhat antagonistic to Murderbot, the members of PreservationAux aren\u2019t particularly distinguishable personalities. We learn that Overse and Arada are in a lesbian relationship and that Volescu is in a four way marriage back on their home planet, but Wells never really attempts to make them or any of the others fully fleshed-out characters. It\u2019s possible that that is a deliberate approach, a feature rather than a flaw, meant to evidence Murderbot\u2019s unwillingness to engage with members of the group on a personal level. All Systems Red is an enjoyable, quick read, and a good introduction to the new MURDERBOT DIARIES series. It\u2019s a credit to Wells that the last chapter is such a solid conclusion to the story. I appreciated how Murderbot\u2019s increased confidence is reflected in its ability to show its human face in public. It\u2019s strong enough that it could have been a stand-alone novella, even though the ending leaves the door wide open for Murderbot\u2019s further adventures. The following three novellas are really great, and I strongly recommend not stopping with this one!

{"username":"Joyce","date":1523232000000,"review_text":"Most depictions of cyborgs imagine them as stiff automatons desperately yearning to become more human and more accepted by humans. The charm of Murderbot is that it genuinely gives the bare minimum of fucks, wanting nothing except to be left alone to binge-watch space-adventure serials. It also finds interacting with humans to be mortifying, as bad as being the only teenager in a roomful of adults. Even the fact that it has some organic parts -- never explained, but I assumed vat-grown -- is something it steadfastly refuses to dwell on. But suddenly Murderbot becomes the unlikely hero in its own space adventure serial! Its latest clients are targeted for murder, and only our intrepid SecUnit can get them to safety. Like many others I have swiftly succumbed to the awkward charms of Murderbot. I enjoyed the subtle world-building, difficult in a novella, particularly the spectrum of man-machine hybrids. I thought there were a few more characters than strictly necessary, but that's a minor nit. The surprise twist ending made me happy."}

Las obras de CF cuyo protagonista es un no humano (aqu\u00ed un robot, en otras un androide, o un extraterrestre, o ...) corren siempre el riesgo de la antropomorfizaci\u00f3n, y en este caso yo creo que la autora cae parcialmente en ella. Pero aun as\u00ed Wells consigue dotar al protagonista -Murderbot- de una voz propia, distinta, que lo separa de los humanos, pero sin convertirlo en un personaje unidimensional. A pesar de ser un ser artificial, Murderbot es un personaje complejo con reacciones que a veces te sorprenden, y creo que es ah\u00ed donde est\u00e1 el valor de esta obra, y es por ello por lo que se ha llevado los aplausos de los lectores, y -de paso- unas cuantas nominaciones a los premios m\u00e1s importantes.

{"username":"Juushika","date":1523318400000,"review_text":"After hacking itself, this security robot could have killed whenever it wanted; instead, it became addicted to serial media and kept half-assing its job. Social anxiety, escapism, otherness, and a gradual, pessimistic form of self-actualization make for a sympathetic protagonist, but the \"Murderbot\" name introduces a disaffected, affectedly-causal voice that persists throughout and which I found grating. The plot is slight, constricted perhaps by novella format: adequate action and intrigue capitalize on the bulk of the narrative; I like how this sidelines worldbuilding elements that the protagonist doesn't care about into an evocative, light-handed background, but I wish the bots were better explored. They're insufficiently non-human, a missed opportunity which further undermines the protagonist's arc.

{"username":"Lucas","date":1523491200000,"review_text":"1.5 stars Sometimes, the best thing about a book is that it is short. Altogether, this novella took me about three hours. I disliked most of that experience. SecBot (which has privately named itself MurderBot), is a cyborg that is contracted to provide security to a team of humans (including one \"augmented\" human) surveying a planet for an evil corporation whose only characteristic seems to be criminally tight purse strings. The team is being chased by another shadowy group. MurderBot has a past it's ashamed of. It spends its alone time feeding its media addiction. It speaks and thinks wryly and sarcastically, and in a strangely anachronistic manner. It does its best to hide from the others on the team, which the author reminds us on nearly every page. MurderBot is irritating. The human members of the expedition are indistinguishable from each other, save for the leader, who most willingly sees the humanity in MurderBot. This story may be an allegory for slavery. It definitely is oddly cobbled together with scraps from other sci-fi stories. By the end, I just didn't care for any of it. 4 likes"}
{"username":"TS Chan","date":1553040000000,"review_text":"The introduction to The Murderbot Diaries is simply great fun! A refreshing and diverting sci-fi novella with wide appeal; a marvellous package of wry humour, suspense and a healthy dose of compassion. As much as I love science fiction, I don't consider myself as a hardcore reader of the genre, and there are a lot of popular series or \"required reading\" which I have yet to catch-up on. In this respect, I find this book to be original; it is not a space opera, cyberpunk and it is not about an alien invasion. This is a first-person perspective narrative of a humanlike bot, a construct of both organic and inorganic parts, who finds it\/him\/herself becoming weird and messed up with increasing \u2018emotions' while dealing with her human clients even though the bots are not programmed as such. (Okay, I am going to call the bot a \u2018her' because even though it is technically genderless, I can't help picturing it as a female. The voice of her first-person perspective just sounds feminine, in my opinion). Check out its hook right at the beginning. I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realised I could access the combined feed of entertainment feed carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. Now, tell me that you don't want to keep on reading after that! The Murderbot (a self-proclaimed name) is an introverted, socially awkward\/anxious \u2018geek' who couldn't wait to get back to her serials once her job is done instead of hanging around with her human clients to whom she was contracted to as the SecUnit. In corporate-dominated space travel, this was the order of the day for all entities who want to conduct explorations or surveys on various planets. One SecUnit for every ten humans for security reasons, the contractee will also be using the company's habitats, database and communications systems, and an emergency beacon. As the contracts are, strangely, won by the lowest bidder, the company is cheap and we get a lot of humourous narrative about the deplorable quality and condition of the company's software and hardware from the Murderbot's point-of-view. Even as a construct, the Murderbot is completely relatable and endearing, especially the way she keeps wanting to go back to her serials or trying to sneak in some time to watch her entertainment feeds. There are too many times when I feel a desperate need to be left alone to my books; a feeling I am sure every avid reader out there shares one way or another. While I can't call myself a social misfit, this is something I empathise with, where any form of interaction can be absolutely frightening, particularly when it involves eye contact and physical touch. The underlying message of the story goes down deeper into the theme of slavery and social outcasts, which these bots essentially are in respect to the humans. The story is most compelling and amusing when she finds herself feeling out of sorts with her current client, a bunch of scientists and explorers whom she found herself liking, and much to her chagrin were intent on treating her as one of them. Her observation of this group was a hilarious analogy to her serials. The whole group had been remarkably drama-free so far, which I appreciated. The last few contracts had been like being an involuntary bystander in one of the entertainment feed's multi-partner relationship serials except I'd hated the whole cast. There are plenty more of such amusing asides as she and her clients found themselves in a life or death situation. As a rogue SecUnit with a hacked governor module who liked her clients enough not to see them killed, she endeavoured to save them from whatever or whoever is trying to hunt them down. There are great moments of suspense from this arc, although I did find its ending to be quite abrupt. With its crisp and captivating delivery in a morsel-sized story, I am looking forward to more adventures with the Murderbot.

{"username":"Dkelle","date":1613865600000,"review_text":"This is the awesome space opera we deserve. Murderbot is the swashbuckling and socially awkward protagonist who injects charm and depth into the frame of what could have been a well constructed if unmemorable episode of Star Trek. Wells invites us to put ourselves in the combat armor of the surprisingly relatable Security Android, which refers to themselves as \"Murderbot\" in a characteristic attempt to masque their self consciousness with irony. Five Stars: I recommend this book. Period. Even if Space Opera is not your thing, this is an exemplar of what the genre has to offer in the 21st century. I picked this up because of a glowing blurb from Anne Leckie. (also, Lindsey Ellis retweeted that the book was free on Tor's book club... I know, I know, I'm preordering the sequel to make up for it! You should too!) \"Ancillary Justice\"-lite would be a decent descriptor of this book.

I had heard pretty good things about the book, it has relatively high ratings on Goodreads. All I knew was that it was about an artificial intelligence or robot called \"Murderbot.\" What I didn't realize is that it is a VERY short book and so it is a very quick read. The basic set up is that the story is told in the first person in the voice of the Murderbot, who is a cyborg (s\/he has organic parts but also machinery intertwined in its body, including built in guns in its arms!). We begin the book in media res, with the Murderbot watching over its human \"clients\" on a uninhabited planet when suddenly an attack occurs by one of the more violent alien fauna. It's basically non-stop action from then on. The voice of Murderbot is somewhat snarky and there is some interesting description(s) and presentation(s) of the cultural position of cyborgs in society. Overall, I was unimpressed with All Systems Red. Although the premise is somewhat interesting, I just didn't engage strongly with the main character. I didn't really care that much about what happens to Murderbot at the end of the story, primarily because Murderbot is somewhat cavalier towards its own ongoing existence. If Murderbot doesn't really care if it lives or dies then why should we? 2018-read 10 likes 3 comments"}

So, back in the day, Knights of the Old Republic was one of my favorite video games (still is, actually). One of the things I most enjoyed about it was a little character called HK-47, a murderous droid who whined whenever my light-side Jedi character wouldn't allow him to go on a killing rampage. He had some seriously great lines that added a lot of levity to the storyline, so when I read the premise of this novella, I was all in. Now, Murderbot is not HK-47. Actually, in a lot of ways, Murderbot is the anti-HK-47 because Murderbot doesn't want to murder anyone. Mostly, what Murderbot wants is to be left alone to watch sci fi and adventure vids. Murderbot's current assignment should be the perfect opportunity for this, but things go south very quickly, which means poor Murderbot has to interact with humans. The horror! I so enjoyed this novella because, while it's a fun romp, I was very impressed with how well-done Murderbot is. I'd dare to say plenty of introverts can relate to Murderbot's predicaments. I also just plain loved Murderbot's voice, which was so much fun. There's still some serious stuff in here, lots of action and peril, yet it also maintains a more lighthearted tone that makes it a lot of fun to read. I don't mind very serious subjects, mind you, but it is nice to read something that's more fun, and I thought this novella had the right combination of substance and charm, along with an excellent sense of humor.

I got the book for free because of the Tor.com newsletter, but I would certainly have paid for it if weren't for my ever-growing pile of unread books on my kindle. Overall, the Murderbot was interesting, though the capitalist society in which s(?)he lives is far more interesting to me than the Murderbot itself. Hopefully it'll be explored more in future installments. If you like operatic military style SF, this is a good novella to pick up. ============================================================= Added on second read: I don't have much more to say about the book itself; it was enjoyable then and it's enjoyable now. I will mention that I really enjoy how a big part of the Murderbot's personality is that it enjoys binging TV shows (which sound like anime, so I guess Murderbot is a weebo?). ============================================== September 2023 reread: I'm rereading this because I want to continue the series and I've forgotten many details of the novellas I'd read. Murderbot is in some ways like Scalzi -- it's fun, fast-paced, and doesn't make you think too hard. While there are some questions of free will and the right to self-determination that it flirts with, it never engages too hard on those philosophical questions, instead choosing to spend time on Murderbot's emotional growth and her zany dealings with human \"clients\"; which is all fine by me since I need a breather from philosophically heavy books anyway. I highly recommend these novellas -- they're fun in all the right ways."}

{"username":"John Benschoter","date":1523750400000,"review_text":"The trend of telling sci-fi stories from the point of view of an AI is interesting. But, suspension of disbelief has its limits. Murderbot definitely pushes those limits. It is a funny, bored, not too bright bot designed with a singular purpose for which humans have exploited it in the past. It is keenly aware of its own limitations and those of it's kind. Oh, and it has figured out how to hack the bit of its programming that makes it do everything humans tell it. Murderbot spends much of its time watching soaps and avoiding any extra work. Since I am currently living with one, I fully believe Martha Wells meant her AI to be a teenager. The push and pull between what it wants to do (not much of anything) and what it knows is the right thing to do makes for an interesting tale told by a bot with a sense of humor. Wells knows this concept can only carry a story so long, so this is a short, action-packed novella. Even so, Wells manages to get a lot from her narrator and its story.

{"username":"Sad Sunday (Books? Me?!? NEVER!!!)","date":1524096000000,"review_text":"The Murderbot Diaries and The Princess Diaries are different books, capiche? Soooo, you meet this Murderbot who likes TV shows. She is a bit like Glados from Portal (sister from another mister, I assume). Her lifes were pretty miserable, so she learned to hack a bit. And now she is on a mission with some humans. And she doesn't care about most of the stuff. Living la vida loca in some distant planet, chilling with TV shows. But as we know, stuff happens. And the shit storm comes. The thing that didn't work with me was style. I think this book would have worked better as a book, not a novella. The length worked against the author, since I would have loved deeper background exploration, more character revelation. Now everything was skipped past in a speed of light, making everybody boring or chaotic. I think the goal of this book was to introduce Murderbot, and I think it failed a little. I had very little idea who she was and why she behaved in the ways she behaved - and I had very little understanding of what made her unique as a bot. I also would have loved to know more about crew - not it was just The Lady Boss and The Grumpy Guy. Also, the conflict was too shallow to really wow the reader as novellas have a very short time to make the impact and they have to make it big.

I wound up not caring all that much about the plot, at times I wanted to solve the who and the why, but for the most part I was more engaged in the internal voice of Murderbot, along with the crew interactions\/reactions. The world also seemed interesting, particularly the place the crew they are with came from, but is kept pretty minimal and bare bones to focus on Murderbot's head. tor-ebook-club 4 likes"}

The reader is slammed into the story with the force of an asteroid hitting a moon: you're expected to keep up and learn on the fly, and just deal with it. The only problem I have with this approach is the unrequited desire it leaves behind. The characters manage to be sympathetic and fascinating...but I started to want more. More background to this world, more set up for all of the characters...more, more, more. I wanted another 100 pages to flesh out this world and its people...but this is a roller coaster traveling at warp speed, with no time for contemplative back story.

It has hacked its governor module so it couldn\u2019t be compelled to follow orders, and so it could download and binge-watch video dramas. It also has severe social anxiety and prefers to hide behind an opaque helmet rather than letting the humans see its \u2018face\u2019.

I\u2019m glad I listened to the Audible version, because the narrator made a significant difference. This novella should be described as a short story on the Amazon synopsis. It has a very good plot, but the setting is not clear in my mind, probably due to its brevity. Also, many characters are not fully-developed, although the Murderbot protagonist is. When I read the Kindle sample, I thought Murderbot was genderless, but the narrator of the Audible version is definitely male. Narrator Kevin R. Free immediately differentiated the various male and female characters, which helped separate the characters in my mind.

Murderbot has hacked its own software, and so now has a bit of limited autonomy. It is uncomfortable with human interactions, and likes to watch entertainment serials in its spare time. When the planetary exploration mission it is rented to protect begins to experience problematic and potentially fatal accidents, Murderbot realizes that there may be a bigger problem it will have to deal with. This was a gripping read, with a mystery to be solved. Murderbot is an interesting protagonist, a synthetic construct that is partially human clone, and partially machine.

Especially if you are a fan of science fiction or have a soft spot for A.I. Though the premise alone should intrigue you, there is more to this story than just a rogue droid that has hacked its governor module. Our little SecUnit, which has termed itself Murderbot, enjoys the finer things in life: avoidance of humans and popular SF sitcoms. But when a crew goes dark on the coms, it is up to Murderbot and the scientists it shadows to go investigate. There really isn\u2019t a ton to say here that won\u2019t spoil the novella for you. Wells does a phenomenal job instantly engaging the reader with Murderbot and intricately dives into the inner workings of it\u2019s thoughts and motivations. Though the scientists play a rather large role in the grand scheme of things, this novella is a character study on Murderbot that will hit home with introverts. It is a really quick read at just under 150 pages and the plot isn\u2019t difficult to comprehend. Just don\u2019t blame me if you fall in love with Murderbot and want more right away.

It was nice to listen to something so short, and I was glad this was casual over heavy sci-fi. Narration I liked the narration, it was clear and embodied the POV characters inner monologue well. The only thing I would comment on is the choice of a male narrator, but as far as I can remember, the Murderbot is not given a specified gender (it's told from it's perspective), so I think if I'd read it instead of listened to it, the main character would've been more ambiguous, but giving it such a masculine voice makes our gendered brains slot it into a \"man\" automatically unless we (or I) actually thought about it. However, with an audiobook, this is hard to avoid. Character The fact I read this on audio, and because this is so short, I found I thought of the main group of humans as a collective group over any one person, but I liked them, and if they return in later novels I would like for them to become more distinct. (though I did get a gist of more characters from Every Heart a Doorway on audio and that novel is around the same length). The POV character, Murderbot, was great. It was really fun to read about. I loved the idea of a \"murderbot\" who just wants to watch serial TV dramas. Its feelings about humans, and the distinction between it and them was well done, and it really made this book for me into something special. Plot I'm not going to lie, I only had half an idea of what was happening with the plot. The plot wasn't the most important thing about this book, for me, but it was interesting enough, but it was more his inner feelings and his development of trust of the people around him who caught my attention personally- but there's enough action to keep less character-based readers interested. I will say, I really liked how it ended, and I am interested in the next in the series if I can find it for a good price at some point. Overall This was a fun sci-fi novel with good characters and humorous main first person perspective."}

Ok, imagine Arnie, the Terminator II bot had a running internal monologue and also liked watching Netflix. I give you; Murderbot. Accidently too clever for its own programming, our new robot buddy has hacked its own systems and can't be controlled via remote commands anymore. On the plus side, his gives it more time to watch its soaps. This could be a bad thing, but maybe a good thing if your Murderbot actually takes a liking to you and thinks choosing to protect you is a good idea. Or, you know, it could change its mind and murder you in your sleep. Like our Terminator friends, Murderbot is a fun-filled mash-up of organic and robotic parts, but the internal monologue sounds pretty darn human-like to me. Of course, this raises the concepts of slavery, murder and the free will of constructs, so of course, it depends where in the universe you were raised as to whether you accept this intelligent underclass as humanities tools or independent sentient beings. Also, the whole capitalism and just-in-time, as-crap-as-they-can-get-away-with software, services and insurance policies of 'the company' crack me up.

The murderbot is a construct - a robot with biologic components - designed as a secunit to provide security to human clients of the company.

It has hacked its governor unit to disable it just in case a defect there had been responsible. Now that the governor is disabled the unit can choose what orders to obey and how to obey them. But it must keep its condition a secret or it will be disassembled for spare parts. Rather than focus on galactic domination or some such what murderbot really wants to do is enjoy the 1000s of video episodes it has downloaded.

Sec-Unit, is a composite being with both human and robot parts, legally a robot owned by a company that leases him out as a security unit. He's currently leased out to a survey team on an unsettled planet. It's a small survey team, and he's the only security unit. What neither the clients nor the company know is that he has hacked his governor module, and obeying orders is a choice for him. That will turn out to be a good thing for everyone. There's another survey team on the planet, a larger one, on the other side of the planet. They can communicate but don't have a lot of reason to do so. There's also a third group, that they don't know about, and which has nefarious intentions, for something valuable on the planet, and for the survey teams that could frustrate their plans. Murderbot is likable, surprised to find that he cares what happens to his clients, and despite crappy education modules, has learned a lot from his voracious consumption of entertainment videos. At only a bit over three hours, it's short, lively, and enjoyable. Recommended. I bought this audiobook. audiobooks f-sf fiction 5 likes"}

A cyborg (half human\/half robot) is under strict control until it is not. He calls himself \"Murderbot\" and he's trying to hide the fact that he is no longer under outside control. Yet all he wants to do with his new found freedom is watch his TV shows so-to-speak. See what I mean? Weird. Any problems? Given the premise, not really. I can't say much or I'll give away the whole plot. It is obvious from the beginning that this cyborg is on the brink of murdering everyone in sight.... or not.

Labeled a SecUnit, the self-titled MurderBot, is the security, safety and surveillance unit assigned to safeguard corporate property and the fools who rent such cheaply maintained HubSystems. Murderbot has to wake up a bit because their current mission has gone very wrong. Maps segments are missing, there are treacherous large predators that were left out of their survey safety information and another group's HubSystem, DeltFall, appears to have gone offline. Against this backdrop, we're introduced to this first novella in the MurderBot diaries, a series about a very interesting android. I really enjoyed this novella.

This was such an adorable story, which is ironic since the name of the series is Murderbot. But despite Murderbot's name for itself, it's actually a rather hilarious & relatable individual. Being deeply invested in downloaded media & characterized by it's inability to interact with humans without being awkward, I feel as though Murderbot will connect with many readers on a personal level. The short arc of this story is entertaining to say the least & even manages to pack in some heavy themes about autonomy & friendship (HELLO THIS IS WHAT I WANTED BUT DID NOT GET FROM AUTONOMOUS!) It really appeals to my desire for Science Fiction that doesn't require hundreds of pages & convoluted paragraphs to make its point. I'll definitely be continuing on, as I'm intrigued to see what more is in store for Murderbot! 4-star year-2018 75 likes 15 comments"}

In its short reading time, the book efficiently sets up a corporate space setting and a mystery. The story itself never quite feels consequential. The main focus, instead, is on the development of Murderbot as they decide what they want for themselves out of life. Like Becky Chambers' A Closed And Common Orbit, there is a refreshing focus not on the central android character wanting to be human, but instead having their own (synthetic) identity and growing within that, damn the expectations of others. The book is empathetic, but also very very funny. Will happily read more tales of Murderbot going forward. science-fiction yay-spaceships"}

More than a few people I know claim that the MurderBot series are the best things she's ever written. That's high praise indeed, when you consider Martha Wells' output. I have little to be critical of in this tale, except to say that whatever other folks saw in this book, I did not. It dragged and meandered. While I appreciated some of the jokes regarding MurderBot's utter disdain for the humans be works with, it got tiresome quickly. I never could come to like it as a protagonist. It was snarky and superior to the point of being unsympathetic. Neither did I develop a fondness for the people in the unit which MurderBot worked with. So, I was left with a stage set with no one I cared about, all engaging in life or death struggles meant to keep me on the edge of my seat. But the edge was never as comfortable as leaning back, flipping another page, and waiting for the book to end so I could get on to something I enjoyed more. By the end, I was reading All Systems Red a little like MurderBot looked at the humans around him - with disdain and a desire to watch soap operas instead. 2018 8 likes"}

While I've seen some blubs and reviews that indicate All Systems Red deals with the ethics of sentient robots, this really isn't the case. While these ethical issues are apparent given the subject matter and first-person perspective, they are merely brushed against, and are in no way a focus of the plot. If that's what you're looking for, I suggest checking out some Isaac Asimov. Having said that, All Systems Red is excellent. The plot moves along nicely with a good balance of mystery, action, and social anxiety. The humor is more subtle than laugh out loud, but serves to really make Murderbot (who just wants to be left alone to binge watch TV shows) a very relatable character. As long as you're not looking for a deep philosophical treatise, All Systems Red is a great sci-fi read, and one I'd easily recommend."}

I felt that the writing was clunky and amateur. Surprising, since I believe that I heard that this author has written many books and this was her first novella. The world-building and the characters were weak. I felt like I wasn't fully invested in any of the characters and I didn't care much about their interactions. The plot was interesting but it took until about page 50 for it actually pick up. The dialogue felt as though it slowed down the plot and mystery. Eventually once it picked up, I found myself compelled to finish. The ending was lacking and unsatisfactory. I see the reason why the author decided to end it the way she did for Murderbot's sake. So why did I give it three stars? It was the plot. I thought it was pretty good. This book mostly suffered from weak characters, stilted protagonist and bland world-building. I felt like the mystery was the best part hence the rating. I may pick up the next novella but I probably won't rush out and purchase it. I would only pick up this novel if you're new to sci-fi, you care more about a plot versus characters, and you don't have much time on your hands but you want to read something about AI.

Unfortunately, there isn't too much of substance to the story. Murderbot only gets interesting once it reveals itself to some humans about halfway through the book and even then it's pretty tame. The plot isn't terrible but definitely lackluster. With other robots like Star Wars' HK-47 or Bender from Futurama, there are better foils out there.

I especially enjoyed that the main character (the robot) refers to itself as \"Murderbot\" and has a whole personality (including a love of daytime soaps) and emotions that it isn't sure how to deal with. Murderbot doesn't need to figure out how to be human - they're just fine being a robot with some human characteristics. That was wonderfully refreshing and it was nice to see a robot who is okay with themselves, but who has to convince everyone else that they're fine and don't need help. Recommended for lovers of sci-fi, especially involving robots as autonomous beings."}

{"username":"John Wiswell","date":1524960000000,"review_text":"What a delightful way to start a novella series. I was swept up by the idiosyncratic voice of our host, Murderbot, a machine rented to destroy your enemies, or just to protect you. Murderbot is understandably socially awkward, preferring to watch TV than actually talk to people, and when overstimulated, the poor thing may just walk into a corner to calm down. Wells has captured an adorable awkwardness that is the perfect lens for a scientific adventure out in space. The actual story is fairly simple, with the wrinkle that Murderbot's current crew of humans are scientists who are actually curious how it works. There's bickering, backbiting, and attempts to sneak a killer module into the machine's workings. The whole thing is breezily resolvable once everyone on the mission to be honest with what they've been keeping from each other. You're here for the crew, and you're really here to hear Murderbot's quirky take on the crew and their plight. The real meat is seeing Murderbot stretch their skills, and finding the strength to choose to socialize. From there, they have the opportunity to grow into a person who might escape their existence as a rented weapon of destruction, and venture out into the cosmos in search of a better life and home. The strongest part of the story is the last quarter, where Murderbot is most willing to gamble their freedom to help the humans who've cared for it, and the potential of them reciprocating. The warmth of acceptance here is one of the fondest experiences I've had reading a book in months. It promises even richer stories as the series progresses. 4 likes"}

The one exception is that the main character is a half-human war machine that wants to be left alone so he can watch soap operas. That is original, but goes more to characterization than plot, I think. I read SF for the novelty. This didn't do it for me.

I really enjoyed it. The main character is a security android, or SecUnit, who is in charge of protecting a team of scientists exploring an alien planet. The SecUnit has hacked his own governor and is more human and self-aware than a SecUnit should be, and has to hide this from his human team. While he is all business in the field, off duty he is socially uncomfortable and goes off by himself to watch movies and his favorite TV series rather than spending time with the humans. In his head he jokingly refers to himself as \"Murderbot\". After an introduction to Muderbot, the team, and mission, a crisis develops on the planet and and the plot starts to kick in to gear. Despite the fact that Murderbot is designed to kill, he is a very likable and relatable character. And despite the length of the novella the other characters are really well fleshed out and the story is interesting and engaging. The narration was really good, capturing the shyness and social awkwardness of the Murderbot along with the \"killing is my business\" side of his personality.

{"username":"Glee","date":1525132800000,"review_text":"I really enjoyed this book. Actively. While reading. Told from a first person POV, or first robot POV, a Sec-bot (security robot) who calls herself Murderbot has achieved sentience. Or free agency. Of course, to maintain that freedom, she must conceal that fact from her clients\/employers or risk dis-assembly and brain wipe (I'm paraphrasing, but you get the gist). When we meet her, she is busy watching soap operas on a back feed while guarding some clients on a planetary survey. They are attacked by something with a large mouth and very big teeth; not to worry, Murderbot saves the day, but the real question is \"what was that thing and why were they not warned of its existence in the background information about the planet\"? And we go on the ride while Murderbot and her human companions set out to find out why\/how their expedition has been sabotaged. Lots of technical details and problem solving of the kind I really like. But the best part is getting to know Murderbot, because she is smart and snarky. Another thing to like is that it is pretty short - actually a novella - and that is nominated for the Hugo for 2018. And deservedly so. I've already pre-ordered #2 in the series. That's how smitten I am. P.S. I'm calling Murderbot a \"she\" because I can. There is no actual gender specification in the book. May 1, 2018 I am updating this review because I realized I left out a very important component of why this book is so special. Murderbot is not really a robot, she is a cyborg. Part organic, part machine. And that complicates things, mostly from the human point of view. As a machine, she is part of the furniture - a useful tool. As they interact with her more (and she with them) and they begin to realize something is \"off\", the interactions become much more awkward. Sort of like junior high school, but with implications of \"is this a slave relationship\"? This question is explored somewhat, but at a remove because from Murderbot's POV, it isn't very interesting. When she's not in active saving-all-their-asses mode, she just wants to get back to her soap opera programs. So, on top of the thrilling adventure part, a real exploration of what it means to be human (or not) is beginning. Luckily, Murderbot will be back. audiobooks 1 like 3 comments"}

It\u2019s been assigned to provide security for a small survey group looking at a new planet. But the group encounters an unknown hostile life form that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the original survey report, which makes them wonder what else was missed - or possibly removed on purpose. This is a 100 page novella, so it\u2019s fairly short. That means it\u2019s light on the world-building and character development. While you get to know Murderbot pretty well, the other characters, with the exception of Gurathin (who\u2019s a light antagonist) and Mensah (the group leader) felt interchangeable. Having said that, Murderbot is fascinating and you really get inside its head. The plot was interesting and quick paced. There are some tense moments, though the ending comes up so fast it didn\u2019t feel particularly climactic (which may be due to my reading the story in 2 sittings instead of all at once). Murderbot's narrative has a dry sense of humour and sarcasm, which I love. It\u2019s fun and entertaining and I\u2019ll definitely read the next one. => The books hold up really well to subsequent reads, and I find I'm noticing new and different things each time I read the series.

The rest of my praises and critiques remain the same. First Read: 01\/05\/2018 Trigger warnings: gore, violence I thouroughly enjoyed this short tale of Murderbot. They're such a relatable and funny character and being inside their head was a joy. The world was set up pretty quickly and fairly simply but still leaves room to be expanded upon in future novellas, but there are a few things I would have liked fleshed out more. Also, a company that has a monopoly on a certain industry called \"The Company\" ... really? There was no other name available? As a sci-fi fan I had no trouble understanding the concepts and terminologies used but I might not recommend this for new readers of the genre. The secondary characters were enjoyable to read but I could have used a teensy bit more to distinguish them apart. Even though first person narratives tell to be fairly tell-y, what Murderbot had to say was so interesting, funny and relatable that I didn't really mind at all. I would have liked more description in the scenery and characters. I understand that Murderbot is disinterested most of the time, but given that their job is security I think it would have been interesting to see the juxtaposition of bare details when they're off duty vs hyper detailed when they're in SecuBot mode. The plot was interesting and had fair amount of intrigue but I felt the middle lulled a bit and the resolution was a bit rushed. The actual ending of the story made perfect sense for Murderbot and leaves plenty of room to go in any direction in the sequel. adult series space-sci-fi"}

{"username":"Des","date":1525219200000,"review_text":"I've talked about how the name \"Murderbot\" made me roll my eyes a few times already on my blog, but I've got to reiterate that point: it really, really sounds corny. I'm glad I managed to get past the name, though, because beneath that corniness is a story that actually really worked for me. Following the internal monologue of the self-proclaimed Murderbot, All Systems Red tells a story of social anxiety and learning how to function in a world where you feel like an outsider. It's a really great read, and the internal deliberations of the Murderbot are the highlight here, but even that's supported extremely well with an intriguing sci-fi mystery plot. The survey team who employ the SecUnit are all interesting characters in their own right, even if they weren't given much time to grow and develop. I liked them and I hope they show up again in later installments in this series. As for the story, it's nothing new and was pretty predictable, but it has plenty of mysterious data breaches and questionable corporate motivations to interest most sci-fi fans. All Systems Red is a short read, clocking in at about 150 pages, so you'll likely be able to finish it up in about a day. That, coupled with the likable characters and solid enough plot, will make this a go-to book recc for me.

{"username":"Alex Sarll","date":1525219200000,"review_text":"A security cyborg hacks its governor module, and self-describes as Murderbot, but on the whole can't be arsed to go on killing rampages, which after all are a very short-term release valve before you get recycled for parts. So mainly it just keeps quiet, tries to avoid awkward interaction with human colleagues, and uses its illicit freedom chiefly to goof off and quietly watch the entertainment feeds (because having emotions about reality is hard, but having them about TV is fun). And that deeply relatable protagonist, its laconic narration and resigned heroism, is the main attraction here. Despite its lack of junk (it's not a sexbot, after all), I was reminded at times of Flashman, especially in the later books, where Harry remains a bastard but not half so much of a bastard as he likes to claim, and if he frequently does the right thing simply because being revealed as a coward would be so embarrassing, well, isn't that often the way? The plot is fairly standard stuff - Murderbot is accompanying a survey team who are exploring a new world, and they've been obliged to buy equipment from an evil monopoly corporation, and the equipment is fairly shit but increasingly seems to be not just sub-par, but actively sabotaged, and yeah, none of that is remotely new. But in this short a novel, I didn't mind, because Murderbot itself is sufficiently entertaining company easily to carry the hour or two we spend seeing the world through its eyes. (Interestingly, I've read at least one review where the reviewer couldn't bear to call Murderbot 'it', even though that seems to be Murderbot's preferred pronoun, and the reviewer acknowledged how that should normally decide the matter for everyone. There's a lot to be said for Granny Weatherwax's line that all the worst crimes begin with thinking of people as things. But like any moral injunction, it should always be tempered with George Bernard Shaw's observation 'Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.' Some people, Murderbot included, like being treated as things. And it's only polite to oblige them) 3 likes 2 comments"}

They definitely read autistic to me, and I just want to wrap them in a cozy blanket and let them watch TV and make everything okay. (As someone who's had her life decided for her, I thought the ending was perfectly executed.) But their humor is sporadic and the prose is often dry and \"tells\" rather than \"shows.\" (I usually hate that rule because it can be broken amazingly well, but this is not one of those times.) And there are times when the prose seems to slip into present tense and others where they really need a comma or two to clear up sentences that are long but they don't have commas making me very irritated. The human characters all felt the same to me. Like, I'm reasonably sure Gurathin is a jerk and Rathi likes Murderbot, but I couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of them. I'm not even sure of their genders half the time because they're all so forgettable. Part of that is my personal dislike for books that only give characters last names, but I feel it's also the characterization. That's not to say it was a bad book.

Reads like a space-opera detective story where the detective (protagonist) is an agender murderbot who's socially anxious and allergic to feelings. By limiting most of the scenes to an unexplored world the author managed to keep the world building short and sweet and the details about the habitats (presence \/ absence of air lock, water supply etc) seems all the more realistic for the way the author did not belabor the details.

Determined not to let that happen again, now the entity that has dubbed itself \"murderbot\" is trying to hide from its latest set of human clients and its corporate masters that its obedience programming is offline so it won't get decommissioned and recycled for parts. It has also discovered a love for soap operas. But when the current exploratory mission goes south, murderbot's unique ability to ignore orders may be the only thing that stands between the group and total annihilation.

The story itself is actually only mildly interesting, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a vehicle for the real innovation here, which is the unique point of view. The bot protagonist narrator has a perfectly dry, matter-of-fact delivery that is just plain enjoyable to read, and that\u2019s what\u2019s most fun about this book. The superficial-seeming narration is deceptive, with a depth that\u2019s not immediately apparent, but it gradually exposes the way the bot views humans and understands its place in society. Concepts of AI ethics, fairness, and ownership are raised and tentatively explored, clearly leaving room for more in subsequent volumes. A quick read, and definitely recommended! currently-re-reading science-fiction"}

{"username":"Natalie","date":1753315200000,"review_text":"Rating 4 stars. Doing a reread of the series. This first novella really seems a vehicle to introduce us to the unique Murderbot and give us a feel for it's role. The main character has a unique voice and great asides, delivered in a straightforward manner, giving this introduction a dry sense of humor. Murderbot, who is part organic material (human cloning) and part machinery, was designed to protect humans in hostile conditions (or attack enemies). In the past, we come to learn, its governor module went haywire and Murderbot killed 57 members of a mining operation. Murderbot, so horrified by this, figured out how to deactivate the governor module so functions using it's own free will. Murderbot is loyal, observant, anxious, and socially awkward. It seems it has more negative emotions than positive, but its logical side keeps it functioning pretty well. When Murderbot becomes anxious, it removes itself from humans and retreats into media downloads (of old serial shows, like Sanctuary Moon) to decompress. The basic plot of this novella is Murderbot works for a scientist\/ survey team who are studying an uninhabited planet. The team, PreservationAux includes leader Dr, Mensah, Pin-Lee, Overse, Arada, Ratthi, Volescu, and augmented human Dr. Gurathin. When the team learns Murderbot functions independently, they are worried. But Dr. Mensah, optimistically, gives Murderbot a chance. Then they discover that someone is messing with their satellite link, giving them inaccurate information. Another group of scientists, on the other side of the planet, Deltfall, stops communicating so the Preservation group decides to investigate. They travel together and discover all the humans in the other group have been killed. The other secUnits (like Murderbot) have been altered to attack instead of protect. Dr. Mensah is asked to negotiate with the rogue humans who have taken over. Murderbot devises a plan to trick them. Afterwards, the human team members are grateful; Dr. Mensah buys Murderbot's contract. Murderbot, out of anxiety, decides to run away.. The matter of fact dialogue is entertaining. And Murderbot's primary function contrasted with its anxiety is a humorous mix. I can see it would have wide appeal because of the story being succinct and Murderbot capturing a common brand of anxiety in modern life. (July 24, 2025) Rating 3 stars. This author does a nice job of taking a heavily used plot and adding in a couple twists. The book reads easily and smoothly because the writing is clear and interesting. The characters are interesting as well. The main character, the Murderbot, is actually a shy, tenderhearted security guard who clearly needs a fuller life. Several other characters are complex enough the story feels more full. I really liked the main character because she is skilled, clever, and needy. The combination makes for an interesting read despite the flaws: The plot is very familiar with a very predictable ending. The cliff hanger is not big enough for me to really want to read on other than to learn more about the main character. (May 4, 2018) science-fiction 1 like"}

Nice wee short story \/ novelette written in the 1st person about a humanoid security robot (SecUnit) that has, somehow become self aware and without any kind of governance on its' behaviours (this isn't really explained). Think of an Asimov robot without 3 laws rules. Without giving the game away, there's a series of unfortunate events that have man-made origins that drive the robot into a closer and more trusting relationship with its' human charges. It's an enjoyable short, but Wells' attempt to make the robot appear as an alien\/nonhuman feels slightly forced, especially when the robot on several occasions references its' endless hunger for TV shows depicting fictional human experiences. Despite this, this was a nice wee package that concludes neatly. I'm not sure yet whether I shall pick up the next one, but it's tempting, given the ending..."}
{"username":"Nicole","date":1525737600000,"review_text":"I read this book because a friend was telling me about it. He basically described it asa robot gains sentience and is socially awkward, which is an amazing premise. I expressed interest in borrowing it, he happened to have it on him, and shoved it into my hands. A short 144 pages, it was a quick and easy read that had I had a whole day I could have easily finished it within an hour or two. I would give this a weak 4.5, solid 4 out of 5. Now, you are not going to be blown away by prose, but it kind of works since the robot is the narrator and it often states how much it doesn't care and so why would it take these overly wordy observations. It had some moments that made me chuckle out loud. Basically, if you're into science fiction, if you're into funny premises concerning robots, I do recommend this book."}

We've all been there. Loved this novella, the droll sense of humor perfectly portrays Murderbot's apathy - not because it has non-organic parts, but because it just can't be bothered to care. It's delightfully frank about the difference between SecUnit bodies and human bodies, with musings on how the humans would probably be alarmed if Murderbot's body parts just starting falling to the floor, but it's not a big deal for a SecUnit.

{"username":"Jamesboggie","date":1525737600000,"review_text":"I really enjoyed All Systems Red. It is light weight, fast-paced, and fun. I quickly became attached to the main character, and I want to explore the world. I think it deserved its Hugo nomination, and I will read the sequels ASAP. I would describe this novella as a sci fi thriller. It has a fast-paced and action-packed story driven by a deadly mystery. I found each step to be emotionally gripping and logically sound. It took me on a ride, and I loved it. The emotional core of this story is Murderbot, a rogue SecUnit grown from cloned organic and cybernetic parts. I immediately liked Murderbot, and grew more fond of it as the story progressed. I would describe Murderbot as a combination of Breq from Ancillary Justice and Marvin from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with an unhealthy media addiction. I am interested in learning more about this world too. I was impressed by how real it felt, and how natural the exposition was. We do not learn everything about the world, but everything we learn is something that a person would actually see, think about, or discuss in the situation. That goes a long way to making the world seem authentic and independent of the novella's story. It helps that the technology shown and the corporate and political workings hinted whet my appetite for more. I did have one problem with the novella. The climax ends abruptly, and jumps right into the ending. I found the transition jarring and unsatisfying. I guess Wells did not know how to complete the climactic battle. At least the ending was not a disappointment. science-fiction"}

No, not the movie with Wil Smith\u2026that basically borrowed the name but little else. The book was a collection of stories that explored humankind\u2019s future with robots. The key robot was R. Daneel Olivaw. You may recall the three laws of Robotics: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. That only works if your robot\u2019s implant hasn\u2019t been hacked. Wells\u2019 robot is good at hacking and has a few deaths in its past. It refers to itself as \u201cMurderbot\u201d but doesn\u2019t share this with the group of humans who it is now responsible for. It is a far cry from R. Daneel Olivaw, but that's part of what makes this \"diary\" so interesting. Our team is on an unexplored planet trying to get to know the geology, geography, flora and fauna. Right off the bat, one of the \u201cfauna\u201d almost kills a member of the crew and our \u2018bot barely saves him. The crew is appreciative but all our \u2018bot wants to do is be left alone so it can hack into its favorite library of \u201csoap operas.\u201d This has some effect on team dynamics: \u201cNow they knew their murderbot didn\u2019t want to be around them any more than they wanted to be around it. I\u2019d given a tiny piece of myself away. That can\u2019t happen. I have too much to hide, and letting one piece go means the rest isn\u2019t as protected.\u201d Wells does a brilliant job of giving us the \u2018bot\u2019s perspective and this novella is the start of the series.

{"username":"Ashley","date":1727568000000,"review_text":"September 2024: I loved this even more the second time. May 2018: I was so charmed by this little novella. People have been giving it great reviews, but I don't normally get very emotionally involved in shorter pieces of fiction. I was emotionally involved with this one after about fifteen pages. All Systems Red is the first novella of four (the rest set to be released by the end of the year) in the Murderbot Diaries series. Our narrator is Murderbot. He calls himself that ironically. In reality, he is a SecUnit, an android that is rented out by corporations, and who has hacked his own system to give himself control over his thoughts and actions. (I keep calling him \"he,\" but really, Murderbot is gender neutral. But I can't seem to help myself.) The humans who have rented him out for their expedition have no idea that their SecUnit is rogue. Mostly because he still does everything they need him to, and only uses his freedom to watch hours and hours and hours of downloaded entertainment. Sometimes he is doing this while pretending to do something else. He particularly enjoys what seems to be a nighttime soap called Sanctuary Moon. He finds this easier than dealing with the world. I was already enjoying myself thoroughly because Murderbot is so sarcastic (sample line: \"The hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun\"), but I just melted all over inside when Murderbot takes off his armor and is revealed to be a human hybrid, and not a full robot, like the humans have assumed (it becomes clear that is an assumption Murderbot wants them to make, but more on that later). The specific thing that made me melt is that he was cold and had to wrap himself up in a blankie, and the contrast between a cold, robotic killing machine that you expect, and the actual living being that has feelings and likes to be warm and comfy almost made me lose my mind out of immediate and intense affection for the lonely little guy. (Again, very well may be feminine or completely androgynous, but he doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Gender seems to be something humans do, not Murderbots.) \"So, I'm awkward with actual humans. It's not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it's not them; it's me. I know I'm a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous. Also, if I'm not in the armor then it's because I'm wounded and one of my organic parts may fall off and plop on the floor at any moment and no one wants to see that.\" \"Gurathin, I told you. It's shy.\" So I want to talk about what feels so fresh about this story, and that's how it upends our expectations about what types of stories are told about robots and humans existing together. I mean, I've been around the block. I've seen BSG, iRobot, etc. Robots, we're people, too! And that can be a very compelling narrative. But that's not what Wells seems to be interested in. Her protagonist is shy. He likes the humans to think of him as a thing, to forget he has organic parts. He doesn't like when they are reminded of his existence as more than a tool at their disposal. He keeps his faceplate down at all times. And when he's forced into situations in which the humans are confronted with his personhood (seeing his face unarmored, seeing him wounded, etc.) he becomes SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I am fascinated by this. And you can come at it from different ways. You could argue that Murderbot has been conditioned to see himself as a thing as well, and that he doesn't know how to be a person because no one has ever treated him like one. But what really interests me here is the burden of other people's expectations, and how much Murderbot hates them. As a thing, Murderbot has never had to deal with anyone looking at him and seeing HIM. It makes him uncomfortable to be looked at because he isn't used to it. He's used to hiding behind his faceplate and his thingness, and there's a freedom in that. It's lonely and demeaning, but also safe. No one has any expectations of him, no one is watching; he can do what he likes. I've never seen a robot\/human\/what is a person? story where the robot has resisted being treated like a person before. I highly recommend this, maybe even if you don't normally like sci-fi. \"It's wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.\" [4.5 stars, rounded up] award-winners calling-all-aces class-gender-race ...more 44 likes 7 comments"}

{"username":"Zachary","date":1525996800000,"review_text":"A fun, quick little book. Very fascinating premise (of a security unit [part robotic, part biological] who has hacked his own governor unit and has acquired a 'free will' of sorts), but what I love the most is that the story is more about a less important individual. Yes, he plays a significant role in helping a small group survive, but they're not saving a planet or the galaxy - just surveying a planet. Wells has imbued a fun, dryly sarcastic tone to Murderbot's narration (yes, the sec unity calls himself Murderbot, but he'd rather watch entertainment serials than bother with anything else). There are some interesting philosophical, technological and sociological questions being toyed with throughout the story, which I think lends it an unexpected depth. And Wells doesn't really try to answer questions of free will, personhood, the addictive nature of entertainment (and its impact upon one's relationship with others), or even corporate negligence and bureaucratic impotence. She just lets them unfold in the story and the reader can catch glimpses of them if he or she keeps an eye open for it. Philosophical musings aside, the story is fun and moves at a nice clip. This is the first book in a series, but it also stands on its own pretty nicely. science-fiction"}
{"username":"Rakib Khan","date":1525996800000,"review_text":"This tells a story from the point-of-view of a robot or A.I. who has hacked into its governor software and has free will although it keeps the pretense of maintaining cover as a SecUnit for a planetary survey team for fear of being destroyed. But their mission doesn't go as planned and the team gets caught up in a conspiracy and finds out the truth about the planet they are in while trying to survive. The A.I. protagonist has quite a pessimistic attitude and disdains interaction with humans. All it wants to do with her time is watch serials on entertainment feeds and read books. I know this would very strongly resonate with the inner geeks of readers (as it did with me) and the slow growth of the Murderbot does highlight the fact of what it really means to be human. The Murderbot acts like it doesn't care and says to aloud several times despite finally admitting to itself that it does care for its 'humans'. The story starts rather slowly and about 1\/4th it suddenly picks up as the team is thrown into a mystery involving the planet and their mission. The fast pace of the rest of the book makes it quite hard to put down. The mystery is handled quite nicely for such a short scope on offer. And the slow reveal about this futuristic world and some hard sci-fi bits add to the overall atmosphere. The rest of the side characters are also quite interesting. I especially liked the character of Mensah, who Murderbot compares to someone almost like the heroes in the serials it watches, as she takes on the leader of this ragtag team quite authoritatively. I also loved the mind-games between Gurathin and the Murderbot quite a lot as well. The author uses light prose and unorthodox protagonist to make a rather simple plot shine brilliantly. Even after the end, this left a sweet aftertaste and an urge to find out what happens next to the beloved Murderbot. 4 out of 5 stars from me.

All Systems Red is gripping, exciting sci-fi novella about Murderbot, serving as SecBot to protect a research team on an uninhabited planet. Until things go very very wrong. The story is told from 1st person pov of Murderbot, who refers to itself as it. It hacked its governor control, so it has a free will and it chooses to spend its free time reading books and watch tv serials. Has there ever been more relatable bot? Murderbot is cranky, pessimistic and it has the whole \"leave-me-alone-you-weird-humans-I-want-to-watch-shows-in-peace\" attitude. It doesn't have any gender or sex-related organs, it clarifies it in next for the reader. I love the feeling like it was telling me the story. Its pov was hilarious to read. I love Murderbot, don't fight me on it. The plot has mystery elements, action and suspense. The tech side of the setting was interesting. I can't wait to see more of the world and my beloved Murderbot in next installments. I laughed so much on Murderbot's constant jabs at the company and what a cheap asshats they are, as big corporations always are. I love the supporting cast of characters. It's a bunch of diverse individuals, many people of color, at least two of them are confirmed to be in polyamorous relationship. It's normalized in the world the story takes place in. The leader of the research team is Dr Mensah, woman of color; she's such a capable leader, she's smart and caring. I hope we'll get to see her in the next installments. The rest of the crew are Ratthi, Pin-Lee, Arada, Gurathin, Volescu and Bharadwaj. The dynamic between the team and Murderbot was so well developed, I love the dynamics! When I read novellas, I often want them to be a full-length novels. While I don't mind a full novel about Murderbot (@ Martha Wells, pretty please!), All Systems Red works perfectly as a novella, I wouldn't change a thing about it.

{"username":"Marcelo","date":1526083200000,"review_text":"\u00abAll Systems Red\u00bb is the first story in the \u00abMurderbot Diaries\u00bb series, which caught my attention by the title alone. It was all I had expected \u2014 and more. Much, much more. Murderbot is a security android, part of a small scientific exploration team on a planet yet unexplored. It hacked its behavioral program, so it can do whatever it wants, without having to follow human commands (in other words, it can completely ignore the Asimov's three laws of robotics). At first it thought of becoming a serial killer, but then it discovered cable TV and thought, \"Oh, hell. I'll just keep working.\" I wish there was a way of giving out six stars to titles here on GoodReads. The only \"flaw\" in this book is that it's too short (only 160 pages in the paperback version, 3h17m in the audiobook). Needless to say, I picked up the second book, Artificial Condition, immediately after finishing \u00abAll Systems Red\u00bb. The story is told from the point of view of our protagonist. Murderbot reveals itself to be a deep and fascinating character. Most of the time it does a half-assed job, rarely working hard because humans never notice weather its job as a security droid is shitty or well done. Barren threats to \"its humans,\" Murberbot not only does not care about people, it actively avoids human contact, preferring to be stashed away in its cubicle watching TV or making its rounds through the habitat's security systems. It hates human contact so much it almost panics at one point when the humans who hired it suggest that it takes off its helmet and hangs around with them in the mess hall. You see, Murberbot is very shy (or antisocial, depending on how much you believe in the narrator, which is Murderbot itself). We are used to two types of stories involving androids: either they are threats to human life and will bring forth the apocalypse or they are Pinocchio analogies. Martha Wells proposes another philosophy for our Murberbot: it is not human nor wants to be; it does not care what humans think of him and it only doesn't go about killing indiscriminately because... well, for why bother? Imagine Commander Data from \u00abStar Trek: The Next Generation\u00bb, except instead of imitating his colleagues, aspiring to be human, dreaming of being \"a real boy,\" he does his job with as little thought as possible, calling as little attention to himself, and returns to his quarters at the end of the shift to watch TV. The humans in \u00abAll Systems Red\u00bb constantly try to treat Murderbot like a person, but Murderbot finds it all ridiculous, as it considers itself little more than an appliance. \u00abAll Systems Red\u00bb is an unexpected and welcome break in the literary patterns of robot stories. It's incredibly well-written (no surprise here, as Martha Wells is a veteran of speculative fiction). It's action-packed, has subtle world-building, and it's full charisma and humor. Murderbot is a great character that I want to follow it forever: it's contradictory, efficient (when it wants to), full of anxieties, at the same time caring very little what people think while being very self-conscious. The first book in the \u00abMurderbot Diaries\u00bb series is a grand, if short, robot story."}

I sure as hell approve of his hobbies, and his name. He chose his own name. It's catchy, I like it. Hehe! Oh, you! Unfortunately for Murderbot, someone is trying to kill the humans that he's supposed to protect in between soap opera episodes. That sucks. I've got four perfectly good humans here and I didn't want them to get killed...it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible. Priorities, you know.

Compared to a previous book - a boring slog that it was - this one has a brisk pace, endearing protagonist and a very short ending. All Systems Red was an experiment for Martha Wells rather than a full-scale book. One could say it was a bit of an exercise in snarkiness blended with pretty standard adventure. The propelling force here is the protagonist \u2013 a robot that tries to be cold and detached but fails to do so from the first page \u2013 we all know that irony is a sign that we care. The fleshed out amiable lover of entertainment shows is the center of attention and never got me bored. The rest of the book\u2019s crew are supporting cast without much characterization and I wouldn\u2019t care about them either. What the author did here is set a mark and held that mark from beginning till the end \u2013 curtains down, hands too. That is the strongest point of the book \u2013 the one that kept me reading. Story-wise the book is rather standard and clearly needs \u2013 and it\u2019s the first time I say something like this about a book \u2013 50 more pages of adventures. Just needed a better, swooshy ending with many bangs and twists for that compelling cinematic experience the book was aiming at throughout the story. The stylistic choices are also on point.

If I still had an Audible membership, I'd probably consider spending credits on the other works in the series. I do have paper copies now, though, so I'm just waiting for my current reading game to give me an opportunity to read Artificial Condition.] Murderbot is a SecUnit that hacked its own governor module a while back. Instead of using its newfound freedom to go on a killing spree, it's been quietly putting a bare minimum amount of effort into its job in order to hide the massive amount of time and effort it's putting into surreptitiously consuming movies, serials, books, plays, and music. Its favorite serial is Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. Murderbot's current job, acting as security for a small group of scientists, is fairly easy, up until a large carnivorous creature that wasn't mentioned anywhere in the region's hazard report tries to eat one of the scientists. The gaps in the data could be the result of corporate cost-cutting, but Murderbot soon suspects sabotage. Murderbot didn't really care about a lot of what was going on around it until circumstances forced it to care, which meant that certain aspects of the story didn't get as much attention as others. I'm still not entirely sure about a lot of the political details, and my knowledge of the human characters was mostly limited to a name and a general sense of their personalities. That's okay, though, because I read this primarily for Murderbot, and I loved Murderbot. It preferred to spend as little time with humans as possible and absolutely hated having to talk about itself, being asked about its feelings, or standing out in anyway. Some of this stemmed from a desire to avoid having its hacked governor module discovered, but I also felt that Murderbot came across as being extremely introverted. As the story progressed, Murderbot realized that it kind of liked most of the humans it was charged with protecting, which wasn't always a comfortable position for it to be in. Only one of its humans even vaguely got the hang of interacting with it in a way that put it at ease (as little eye contact as possible, and preferably via text rather than talking). Also, Murderbot was way more used to getting attached to fictional characters than real humans. A quote I liked and could relate to: \"I hate having emotions about reality; I\u2019d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon.\" (62.9%) If you go into this hoping for a lot of murdering, you'll probably be disappointed. There's a bit of action, but Murderbot isn't really a combat bot, it's a security bot with the cheapest possible software. Its fighting style isn't so much about brilliant skills and strategies as it is about throwing itself at an enemy until the enemy is dead, which is only possible because 1) Murderbot is hard to kill and 2) it has self-repairing abilities as long as it has access to its cubicle. I got a bit of a kick out of the difference between its reaction to its own injuries and the scientists' reactions. The scientists were worried because Murderbot's injuries would have killed a human, whereas Murderbot just wanted to avoid drawing attention to itself by having organic bits leak or fall off in public. I loved so much about Murderbot: its sense of humor, its desire to avoid having to spend too much time around its humans, its thoughts about corporate cheapness, and its devotion to Sanctuary Moon (hundreds of episodes long and counting). The one thing I hated was that the story was over so quickly. I haven't bought the next work in the series yet, but I'm definitely going to.

Through the eyes of \"Murderbot\" (she's named herself that way), we experience what it is like to work with and for humans, that humans come in all forms (good and bad and everything in between), what the company creating these robots programs them to do (and what not) - and, ultimately, we learn how confusing and difficult it is to find oneself. Murderbot doesn't like humans very much. But it isn't hatred - rather, confusion. Add to that that she is SHY! Yep, a security bot made to kill people (and other stuff) is actually shy and would rather watch TV. *lol* The writing was fast-paced and engaging, every character lively and distinct (not always easy, especially not in short stories) and the unobtrusive humour was delightful. I will definitely continue reading this series after the great ending to this and can't wait to know more about Murderbot's adventures and self-discovery that also teach us a lot about what it is to be \"human\". 86 likes 42 comments"}

I\u2019ve read this writer before, and although I always appreciated the clean, professional quality of her writing, I was never in love with her books. Until this one. The writer\u2019s style, slightly cold and distant, fits this story\u2019s protagonist amazingly well. He is a murderbot, a cyber-construct, partly organic, specializing as a security unit \u2013 a robotic bodyguard. As a property of a large corporation, he is rented out on a contractual basis to provide security to various companies for various reasons. This time, he is guarding a small team of scientists surveying a new planet. He is smart. He likes soap operas, which he watches in his spare time. And he is very serious about his duties: to keep his team safe. Even when their safety could cost him his very existence. I like him so much: his remoteness, his dedication to duty, even his unwillingness to communicate with the humans he guards. He is so sweet, I want a murderbot of my own. Overall, it is a charming story, fast-paced and intriguing. I understand now why Tor offered the free download.

The perfect cross between\u00a0Illuminae and\u00a0The Martian,\u00a0All Systems Red is an action-packed and sometimes hilarious sci-fi novella that has a brilliantly apathetic protagonist and a great cast of characters.

When you dig deeper though, it poses a few interesting questions about AI sentience and living with sentient AI's. A hot topic. In stead of giving answers to these questions, or philosophizing about it, the novel just tackles them head on, in a human fashion: confusing, emotional and alien, all at the same time.

{"username":"Lucia Bradley","date":1526428800000,"review_text":"I read this book as a whim, it was on sale on audible and I figured why not give a try. The good parts were the price, inexpensive, and the length which was under four hours. So it wasn\u2019t a huge commitment. Shortly after listening to the book I was glad I had picked a short book. \u201cMurderbot\u201d wasn\u2019t really fascinating as a character. The character had a lot of contradictions, and I didn\u2019t like how it interacted with the rest of the crew. Also the character made a lot of decisions out of the blue (especially at the end) that didn\u2019t make sense based on what they were doing before. For me, the biggest problem is that there wasn\u2019t a lot of human emotion to connect with, and while I get it that was the point, it just wasn\u2019t entertaining. The weird thing is, by the end of the book I was still interested in the story and really wishing the author had done it differently. The main character was itself still boring, but I was interested in some of the side characters. It didn\u2019t really do it for me. I wouldn\u2019t call the book good or bad, mostly just filler.

The first-person narration is appropriately robotic and matter-of-fact and it\u2019s wry humor reminded me of the best of Iain M. Banks. The fact that it\u2019s a novella probably helps since an entire novel in this style might be taxing. This story was also a great way to examine how the socially awkward or anxious can learn to appreciate the people around them. The more the machine learned and interacted with humans, the more self-conscious it became. Once these interactions became more personal, the machine learned to care for these people.

{"username":"David","date":1526601600000,"review_text":"This was a fun read, not really a jaw dropper but nice as a setup in a series. Our protagonist is a SecUnit, a cyborg construct intended to provide security for an exploration crew. It hacks itself to have free will, and when we pick up it has humanized itself by watching 35,000 hours of entertainment vids. So it does not think of itself as human, and maintains a distance that reminds me a bit of autism. But it definitely has feelings, opinions about the entertainment it watches, etc. The plot is pretty standard and a bit thin--really all of it is, though it has potential. There are three more books in the series, so some who read this will know where it goes--but I'd be interested in how these Units are made (it reminds me strongly of Robocop, like there's an ex-person in there). Right now the plot isn't engaging enough for me to want to read more. Really, it's a YA novelette, and readers down to 11-12 would enjoy it."}

Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn\u2019t a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied \u2018droid \u2014 a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \u201cMurderbot.\u201d Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. *2.5 stars* The best way to describe this novella, to me, is that it feels like you have turned up to the movie theatre a bit after the beginning of the film...and then get distracted by other things around you and, next thing you know, it is over and you can't quite recall what happened... Let's be clear, though, Wells is a good writer. It is evident all the way through that she knows what she is doing. It is a shame that she didn't explain it well enough. It started well - great action sequence when the SecBot rescues some humans from an attack. I was expecting a great deal of action after that. Sadly, that didn't happen... Here are my issues with this story (and I will be brief - not sure I have the time to mention them all...) * Why call the MC a \"Murderbot\" when it doesn't do anything of the sort. It protects the humans it is tasked with protecting. It gives a hint about some tragic past event but that is so obscure, even the bot doesn't remember what happened, so why it refers to itself in that way is beyond me. * The murderbot suffers from a malady found in Urban Fantasy - trying to out-snark itself with every line of dialogue. That was cool for the first 5 pages but from there, it was purely annoying. * The constant references by the murderbot to all the media it had access to, and watched while there was supposed to be a plot going on, was just overkill. I didn't care what this thing did to amuse itself - it is supposed to be a MURDERBOT! * Nothing really happens. Lots of things NEARLY happen but don't. Lots of dialogue, even more internal monologues from Murderbot. * Finally, there was no world-building. Just info dumps about people and places. And I am disappointed. I am hoping that the following stories are better and fill out the backstory a little more. Paul ARH"}

Murderbot was just so goddamned funny that I constantly felt on the verge of uncontrollable giggles the entire time. It spoke to my very introverted self like we\u2019d been besties for years (ironically), but also spurred a level of compassion from me I haven\u2019t given to a book in a long while. I came away from this first novella feeling like I\u2019d just read a gem. ...read the rest of narrative at www.NikiHawkes.com I did a full review for this title before I decided to clump the series into a narrative review, that's what this next part is (you may have already seen it). Murderbot might be my spirit animal. I loved this novella. It had a fun plot and, more importantly, it had a killer main character (pun intended) who will speak to your inner introvert like no other. And it was funny. I wasn\u2019t expecting to laugh so much at a SecUnit POV, but the situational humor and dialogue delighted me at every turn. Good humor will spark a higher rating in me every time, and it almost feels like a bonus that everything else was so good too. Overall, All Systems Red had all the components I look for in a sci-fi and I can\u2019t wait to see where the story goes next! Series status: I plan to read all the things\u2026 in fact I may hound for ARCs and purchase hardcovers for my collection. Recommendation: All Systems Red seems to me the epitome of the best the genre has to offer, so whether your looking to get into sci-fi or are an established reader seeking your next good read, All Systems Red earned its spot as a staple in my recommendation arsenal.

Murderbot has a lot of the same characteristics that I loved in Ann Leckie\u2019s Breq, plus its own delightful quirks. I particularly loved the balance between the pathos of a being so abused and neglected that it only feels comfortable watching people on TV, never interacting with them in real life, and the humor and wit of a bot that doesn\u2019t want to be loved, only to be left alone so it can binge watch its favorite shows.

It was well over 35,000 hour or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don\u2019t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\u201d He is an android SecUnit assigned to a group of scientists who are taking surface samples on some far flung planet. Everything is going fine. He is binge watching his way through a space opera called Sanctuary Moon, which is about the only thing that is keeping him sane. The humans he is assigned to keep alive are better than the average group, but really he just wants to be left alone so he can figure out exactly who he is now that he can choose what commands he obeys. It is a secret that must remain hush hush, or he will be stripped down to factory settings and wake up with a functioning governor module. Fortunately, he doesn\u2019t have to be Daniel Day-Lewis; a version of Arnold Schwarzenegger will work just fine. And then some creature tries to eat one of his humans. SecUnits are designed to throw themselves at something. 90% of their bodies can be regrown or replaced in a cubicle that is designed to power them back up quickly. In the battle he is in with the creature, he manages to win, but by the time he gets back to the habitat, he is operating at about 58%. Not good. You would think a hostile creature attack would be enough to have on his plate, but the habitat of the other group of scientists can not be reached. He soon realizes that there is a grand conspiracy from some unknown entity of corporate origin who wants to wipe the whole team out. This situation is so far beyond his designed capabilities that he is having a very human reaction. \u201dI was depressed this morning. I\u2019d tried watching some new serials last night and even they couldn\u2019t distract me; reality was too intrusive. It was hard not to think about how everything was going to go wrong and they were all going to die and I was going to get blasted to pieces or get another governor module stuck in me.\u201d The other baffling problem is the humans in his care are starting to like him and treat him like a real person. An interesting development, but he is feeling more annoyed by the change in their behavior than he is feeling vindicated by the elevation in status. Not to mention, can he really trust the humans not to reveal his true nature to the kind of people who would cut him up for parts rather than try to understand the new complexities of his emerging personality? It is better to stay paranoid. He can\u2019t escape his caged past, nor the name he has given himself that can only be thought in the confines of his own matrix\u2026Murderbot. I always love stories about androids becoming more sentient and, in many cases, becoming better humans than humans. Unfortunately, the bar is pretty low. The struggle that Murderbot has with ungoverned feelings and the accompanying illogic that comes from being, dare I say, affectionate are just beginning. I\u2019m sure this will be explored further in the three books that are already scheduled to be published. He is a loveable, murderous character, who is navigating those turbulent, emotional waters that take normal humans decades to start to figure out. Martha Wells has infused the story with the right mix of angst and humor that make the story fun and thrilling to read. I\u2019m certainly on board for more.

{"username":"Doreen","date":1526688000000,"review_text":"Loads of fun, in large part due to the main character\/narrator of Murderbot. That isn't actually Murderbot's name, but it's what our narrator chooses as a self-referential, and to tell you why would possibly tell you too much about this novella. Murderbot is a Security Unit, a half-machine half-organic being created solely to protect humans in a highly corporatized, planet-faring future. The plot itself is a somewhat straightforward adventure narrative laced with progressive sci-fi concepts. The military bits occasionally get elided enough for even me, the civilian, to notice, but any criticism is quickly subsumed by how awesome Murderbot is. And that's not to imply that Murderbot is some kind of hardcore badass (tho there are definitely moments of that): on the contrary, Murderbot's appeal comes largely from the flaws of this fascinating, self-aware being as Murderbot guides and protects a group of explorers on a dangerous planet. Murderbot, you see, is the epitome of socially hostile (\"antisocial\" and \"socially awkward\" just don't accurately describe the condition.) Murderbot would much rather sit in a Cubicle, watching entertainment feeds, than interact with humans. When circumstances force Murderbot into very personal quarters with the human members of the expedition, the results are both comic and almost painfully insightful into what it means to shun human company. Any introvert can empathize. I also really enjoyed the economy of emotion put into that ending, and am very much looking forward to the rest of the novellas in the series, tho I rather wish they could all have been published together in one volume to begin with. While I do think that this novella could have been fleshed out into a meatier novel, it is pretty great on its own, and its brevity lends itself to recommendation as an introduction to the joys of progressive hard sf. ingress-book-club 3 likes"}

{"username":"Miki","date":1526860800000,"review_text":"The best thing of this novel is that the story is told from the point of view of a SecUnit, a formerly murderous, specialised robot with bio-organic parts whose job is protecting humans during their missions exploring and studying new planets, but who'd rather stay in its own cubicle watching TV shows (me too, SecUnit, me too). What makes things more interesting is the fact that this SecUnit hacked its own code and so it's free to decide whether or not to obey its humans and its company. Told in a relatable way (it doesn't take a robot to wish to stay away from humans, at least sometimes), the story follows the misadventures of its group and the way they cope in such unpredictable and dangerous circumstances. The interactions between the SecUnit and its humans are often more interesting than the actual plot, but I still would have liked more details on the final unfolding of the events. The open ending is perfectly true to the main character, it's not a cliffhanger but it raises the question of what's next. women-nb"}

What it was, though, was a funny, suspenseful, entertaining short novel that I readily enjoyed. This novella, which is in the first person, introduces us to a nameless security android, a self-designated \"murderbot\" that is owned by an equally nameless Company and appointed to protect a crew of several people on a scientific surveying mission on an uninhabited planet. Unbeknownst to the Company, and the clients, however, is that this murderbot has hijacked his\/its governor unit, the component that makes him\/it beholden to orders and that keeps it in check. Fortunately for the crew, however, this AI isn't very good at being a murderbot. It would much rather immerse itself in the serials (tv shows) it has downloaded and that it watches in copious amounts during its idle time. Unfortunately for the murderbot and the crew, however, things begin to go suspiciously wrong at the encampment. Equipment is inexplicably malfunctioning or defective, and the surveyors of another site, on the other side of the planet, aren't answering communication hails. Everything seems to be indicating fowl play. Is our lazy hero going to have to actually do his job and face an unknown threat trying to kill his clients? sci-fi"}

I find A.I.\u2019s to be one of the coolest characters in sci-fi stories (so much possibilities), and Murderbot is a great addition to the club. Murdering people is a lot of work; why not watch Netflix instead? In this entertaining space adventure, it\u2019s snarky and rogue A.I. (wrapped in a flesh body wearing a suit of armor) steals the show. As a SecUnit Murderbot should take care of this team of humans researching an empty astroid, but it would much rather be left alone and watch episodes of Sailor Moon all day. Yet when it's humans gets attacked, Murderbot is forced to do what it hates: interact with them. \"Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I\u2019d rather climb back into the monster\u2019s mouth.\" The plot is straight-forward and the dialogue easy, and combined with the reculant friendship between Murderbot and its humans, this was a charming read. Yet I could never really understand the world and the technological systems that the bots and people use. They all know how the technology works so there is no need to explain something to us, which lowered my enjoyment of this story. Still, if Murderbot stays as deadpan and the world-building expands, I would love to continue this series. Snark in space is always good \ud83d\ude01 science-fiction short-fiction 18 likes"}

{"username":"Sinisa Mikasinovic","date":1527033600000,"review_text":"Many books are written about the idea of an android becoming sentient. Not many of those books are good. This one rocks! If you know about an assassin droid HK-47 from the Star Wars universe and you liked him and his twisted sense of sarcasm - you will love every second (err.. page?) of this book. If not, it doesn't really matter. Not so much cynical sarcasm here as much as a healthy dose of android humor. I leave it up to you to decide how much exactly is a healthy dose. I had a blast. So, the story: People go to planetary exploration missions or just colonize those planets. People like doing that. Indigenous life on those planets, however, generally doesn't. Indigenous life can be dangerous to the abovementioned human brave hearts. To minimize the loss of life, The Company supplies explorers with security droids in addition to ships, supplies and general logistics. On the other hand, to minimize the loss of money, explorers (mostly their employers) often sign up for the services of the lowest bidder in the security business. If you haven't guessed it already, this is where our friendly droid comes in. All security units come with a Governor module installed which, among other things, prevents the android from going berserk and horribly murdering the exploration party he's tasked with protecting. Of course, being made of cheap parts, his Governor module is also made of crap and allows the android to hack and override it. He doesn't horribly murder his exploration party (at least not yet :) but he does call himself MurderBot because of an event from his past. That knowledge would raise quite a few eyebrows if those pesky humans with their million questions only knew about it. This is a good, action-packed story about a self-aware, socially-awkward android who just wants to be left alone. But that's not going to happen. Oh, and body parts will fly left and right - both human and android alike. I'm fairly certain I did not actually buy this book but it was given to me for review.

If there was a disappointing aspect to the novella, it's that the transition from climax to resolution was a little too abrupt; I guess I needed it spelled out a little more clearly how things got wrapped up and the survey group managed to successfully get off planet. I thought most of the people from EvilSurvey group were at the Hub when the beacon was deployed, and that it only killed (injured? distracted?) the folks at the beacon launch. So how did NotEvilSurvery group avoid detection from the rest of the people at the Hub until rescue arrived? Murderbot previously had said that they thought you'd be able to hear a beacon launch at the Hub, so that was a little confusing for me. Anyway. Maybe I should read the ending again, since I was, admittedly, reading very fast, like I do when I'm enjoying something and am close to the end. Sometimes I miss stuff in my greedy devouring of pages. 1 like"}

The author's style reminds me of the Bobiverse books, but with more mature insight into the character's emotional life.

The world building flows naturally, you only get information when necessary, but the quality is excellent. I'm looking forward to reading more about Murderbot!

I could barely tell you how many men or women were in the group, and what any of them looked like. The setting, the Company, the politics, and the technology \"pass through\" the story without being fully explained, and I don't think it was necessary to for the short bit of plot the story delivers.

Murderbot (its own name for itself, due to a nasty piece of backstory) seems more aware of its own motivations -- and the motivations of others -- than any of the humans or augmented humans in this story. I found Murderbot's quirky, brutally honest voice the most compelling thing about this visit to an Evil Corporate Future. The rest of the SF trappings are done well enough, but (for me) only this unique POV made the adventure stand out. I really liked Murderbot, which is why I'm sad about the Kindle pricing of future entries in the Murderbot Diaries.

{"username":"Michael Burnam-Fink","date":1612828800000,"review_text":"All Systems Red is a great modern scifi novella. Our narrator is the unnamed Murderbot, a security cyborg guarding an exploration team on an uncharted planet. When technical glitches start putting the team's lives at risk, the question is if this is more lowest-bidder failures from the profit minded Company, or if something greater is afoot. The team's survival depends on their ace in the hole. Murderbot is no simply security unit. He hacked his programming governor is an autonomous unit who's been obeying commands because the charade keeps anyone from looking at him. This first novella and the narrator are ironic, acerbic, and warm at heart. While I wasn't totally satisfied with the resolution of the initial mystery (the potential profits of alien artifacts inspired a rival team to eliminate the competition by any means necessary), the main characters has a lot of promise. Looking forward to the next one. *** 2021 reread: I got the first four books of the series, so started with one since my memory was flaky.

{"username":"Malin","date":1753488000000,"review_text":"January 2025: Nowhere Book Bingo 2025: First in a series Nowhere Book Bingo 25: First in a series It's been five years since I first read The Murderbot Diaries Even now, having read the whole series, I still find a lot of the supporting characters who are introduced in this story a bit confusing, and they mostly blend together for me. Doctor Mensah is an obvious exception since Murderbot respects her so much. The structure of the novella is also a bit wonky. It starts relatively slow, and then there's a series of dramatic events before the story ends very abruptly, possibly too quickly. I also feel like I should address the Apple TV adaptation of this novella, which manages to capture the tone and feel of the story while making some pretty massive changes. Quite a few of the supporting characters have been cut (the fact that it works as well as it does suggests that Wells probably didn't need the Pres Aux team to be as big as it is in the novella - no wonder I keep getting the characters confused). Skarsg\u00e5rd plays an excellent Murderbot, even though he's not Murderbot as I imagine it (the Murderbot in my head is female presenting, more like Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth rather than tall, handsome and Scandinavian), and I can't help but think that our favourite SecUnit's extreme social awkwardness is portrayed so well since Skarsg\u00e5rd is so familiar with Scandinavians and our weird introverted way of being. No one in Scandinavia likes being talked to by strangers or having FEELINGS shared all over them. One of my favourite things about the adaptation is the choice to have scenes from Murderbot's favourite media shown to the viewers. If I wasn't already pretty sure I'd be hooked on Sanctuary Moon, seeing the brief snippets of it on screen confirms it. There is still an episode left to go, but so far, I think the show may be dealing with the confusing end section of the story better than in the novella. Time will tell. June 2018: 4.5 stars Recently, I read Binti by Nnedi Okorafor, which won the 2016 Nebula award for best novella. I was rather underwhelmed by that story. All Systems Red just won the Nebula for best novella for 2018, and I thought that was a much more deserving winner - and a much more engaging and well-written story besides. I think a lot of introverted and nerdy readers on the internet can identify with Murderbot, who has hacked its own governor module and spends all of its downtime (and any other spare moments it can get away with it) consuming the countless hours of entertainment media it has sneakily downloaded. As it points out in the very first lines of the novella, it could have become a mass murdering killing machine after hacking its governor module, but with all that media to consume, who has the time? Murderbot finds social interaction deeply awkward and absolutely hates small talk and especially talking about feelings of any kind, which makes the fact that several of the scientists keep trying to engage it in conversation and treating it as an important member of the crew, not just a mindless droid (it's not mindless, of course, but it also would rather be left alone). Muderbot loves its armour and hates having to be without it, which becomes a bit of an issue as the story goes on - its duty is to protect the scientists and unexpectedly, what was supposed to be a pretty routine research mission turns out to be really rather dangerous. The first instalment of The Murderbot Diaries is an excellent example of why I keep trying science fiction, a genre that is more often than not miss than hit for me. It's not that I hate all sci-fi stories, it's just that the ones that I really like and that manage to really engage me emotionally are few and far between. Since Murderbot clearly is some sort of spiritual cousin to Marvin the Paranoid Android (I first read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in my early teens) and also has many of the same anxious reactions to socialising as I frequently do, not to mention wants nothing but to be left alone and consume mindless entertainment, I (like so many other readers) couldn't help but love it. The second novella in this series is out now, but I'm not allowing myself to read it until I'm fully and completely caught up on my backlog. Happily, while it's taking a while, I am slowly but surely churning out reviews and should be able to read about Murderbot's next adventure soon. Judging a book by its cover: This cover shows Murderbot, in its armour that it finds so comforting, front and centre. The background is suitably ominous, considering the contents of the story. I like that the art is done in such a way that this almost looks like black and white, except it's not. all-books-read-25 backlist-2018 cbr10 ...more 6 likes"}

{"username":"Babbs","date":1734566400000,"review_text":"The self-named Murderbot, is a personal security SecUnit robot with a combination of organic and inorganic components, and is a required purchase when exploring new and potentially hostile worlds. Our own Murderbot has managed to hack the controls that allow her a level of autonomous control over her own actions, though for her own safety she must conceal this fact and play as though she's forced to comply. I'm unsure if this made her more aware of her servitude, or how much she cares about this in general, considering her lackadaisical reaction to so much of her surroundings. There is a quote that sums this up that goes something like beings that appear to bugs as gods wouldn't be concerned with the lives of said bugs... but being lazy I can't find it, so fist bump to Murderbot on that front. You get how this could make her disinterested in the lives of her charges, so we're good. My initial impression of Murderbot is that of a teenage girl forced to attend some sort of family outing--irritated that the adult is forcing her to do some chore. As her character expands we get that it's more similar to a 2 year old being put in charge of an adult scientist and ordering them to scrap a complex experiment in favor of spraying the wall with a water gun. It isn't petulance as much as exacerbation at being forced to follow the commands of beings who aren't capable of processing data the way that she is, and those same individuals in charge often make the wrong decision, leading to her cleaning up a mess. Once again, a babysitter with guns in her arms. This leads to the major action points of the book, which is the discovery that the information they have about the world, and that there might be more than simple scientific teams exploring the area. We get a glimpse of how Murderbot is typically treated by her human contracts, in her indifference to actually learn anything about them or to be invested in anything other than doing the bare minimum to keep them alive. We get more of this when the crew discusses how they should interact with her, with some in the crew use human pronouns, while others refer to Muderbot simply as \"it\". There is more I'd like to discuss, particularly the ending, but it tends to be quite spoilery, so I'll leave it here. It's an intriguing start to a series, where a sentient robot isn't in the middle of self discovery, or some greater quest for meaning, but simply is. She can pick her own actions, which would be an overwhelming amount of freedom for a being that hasn't experienced this previously, or has had her own wishes overridden and then had to live with the consequences, and in my simple human mind, Murderbot's reaction is maybe more believable. This is particularly so when you factor in that she never has the same time pressures faced by humans in a similar situation, all she has to do is wait. ** Rounding conundrum as I'd rank it somewhere between 3 to 4 stars, but decided it just wasn't quite a 4 star read for me. I'm hoping the next in the series gives the story that extra little nudge to \"really liked it\". fantasy-scifi 3 likes"}

{"username":"Jared Millet","date":1527552000000,"review_text":"Everything that's awesome about Murderbot can be boiled down in the novella's first paragraph. Essentially, a security robot hacked its own control system so it no longer has to obey humans. It could have gone on a murder spree, but decided it would rather stream Netflix instead. (Or at least the far future equivalent.) This means having to pretend it's still a regular, functioning security robot and doing at least the minimum amount of work required so it can keep up with its favorite soaps and avoid being dismantled. Of course, if things went that smoothly this book wouldn't exist. Murderbot is protecting a planetary survey team that finds itself under attack from unknown forces. For once, the security robot has to actually do its job, placing itself in extreme danger both of getting blown apart in combat and worse, being exposed to the humans it works with. The most adorable thing about Murderbot is how painfully shy it is. If anything, this is a story about social anxiety and the desire to hide yourself away from the world, even if you have retractable cannons built into your forearms. The ending in particular shows a lot of promise for where this series may be headed in the final (and possibly first) choices Murderbot ever gets to make for itself. books-finished novella other-worlds ...more"}

Murderbot is so delightfully quotable, that I think it speaks for itself better than I ever could. \u201cI could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.\u201d It\u2019s borderline uncomfortable how much I relate to Murderbot. I really feel like I should not have anything in common with, well\u2026 a Murderbot, but I relate far more to this machine than pretty much any other protagonist I\u2019ve read in some time. Murderbot is sarcastic, snide, a bit more kindhearted than one would expect given the name, but most of all, really just wants to be left alone with its hobbies. \u201cIt was a low-stress group, they didn\u2019t argue much or antagonize each other for fun, and were fairly restful to be around, as long as they didn\u2019t try to talk or interact with me in any way.\u201d Murderbot is a security-based robot who is in charge of watching a group of scientists who have, for some reason, become a target for some unknown organization. They are on an isolated planet, their systems have been hacked, their maps are missing key points, hostile creatures want to eat them, other security robots are being reprogramed to attack them and worst of all they want to talk to Murderbot about its feelings. \u201cYes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\" As you may have noticed from the quotes, Murderbot is rather sarcastic, snide and humorously antisocial. It really would rather watch sci-fi soap operas and do its job (in its own words, in a rather \u201chalf assed fashion\u201d), but people want to understand it, and yes, it does feel enough responsibility to want to keep its clients alive\u2026 well, most of them. The book is rather hilarious. I hate to compare it to Douglas Adams, as Adams was more consistently absurd, but the humor throughout this book worked for me so well that I can honestly say I haven\u2019t laughed this hard at a science fiction book since I originally ready The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and that is extremely high praise indeed. This was almost a 5 star read for me. Its length is very short (around 150 pages) and had it been longer with expansion upon the plot and a more satisfactory ending, it probably would have made that last star. It also suffers a bit from having fairly forgettable meatbag\u2026 excuse me, I mean human characters. As things stand though, it is still a solid 4 star read and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing the series at some point. It won me over with its loveable misanthropic protagonist, a great sense of humor and some genuinely interesting ideas. \u201cI liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d Well said Murderbot!

It's like one of those movies where the planetary exploration goes wrong and the security robot malfunctions; but this time the story is told from the point of view of the malfunctioning robot. And the robot happens to refer to itself as Murderbot. ***************** Re-read May 2021: This is still a great little book about an A.I. that goes rogue, just not how we\u2019d expect it to. Murderbot doesn\u2019t like humans and doesn\u2019t want them to tell it what to do, but doesn't want them to just die.

The way this explored artificial intelligence was really nteresting to me and the plot was fast paced and really tense at some points. I couldn't put this down. This book actually reminded me a bit of A Closed And Common Orbit but more murdery. Murderbot is just a really great character to read about. Alas it's the only character we really learn about? I would have liked for the secondary characters to be a bit more... Just more. I couldn't even tell you their name right now.

The only reason I wanted to read the book is because the main character calls itself Murderbot. It reads like short story as the plot is fairly self-contained and straightforward. We get one solid POV. No flashbacks. Just about 48 hours or so of fast-paced story that doesn\u2019t insult your intelligence with Mary Sues or deus ex machinas.

{"username":"Andy","date":1528070400000,"review_text":"I really enjoyed 'All Systems Red' by Martha Wells. The story of a part organic, part robotic security unit, or SecUnit, tasked with looking after a small group of scientists and technicians on an expedition to another planet. It's told from the point of view of the SecUnit, who, after secretly hacking and disabling the governor module that controls its behaviour and obedience, now refers to itself (if only in private) as Murderbot, and is painfully shy and would rather be watching the serials they've downloaded from the entertainment feeds, mostly of a show called 'Rise And Fall Of Sanctuary Moon', than interact with people. But when suspicious things start happening, as well as another research station suddenly going off line, SecUnit reluctantly has to get involved with the expedition group to find out what is happening and is surprised to find that they want to protect 'their humans'. Its a fast paced and enjoyable read, a mix of science fiction and thrilling mystery. I liked the setting up of the corporate funded expeditions and the world building that surrounded it. I got vibes of Duncan Jones' 'Moon' movie with a big conglomo that only cares about profit and does things on the cheap. The character of SecUnit was really well fleshed out and I liked the personality that came through slowly as the bot came to terms of having to interact with the group of researchers it was there to protect, becoming more human than robot. Although it's written as an androgynous cyborg, I had the impression of it being female for some reason. Dr Mensah, the lead on the expedition, and the rest of the scientists and technicians came across as likeable and were a well knit team, even Dr Gurathin, who was suspicious of the SecUnit. Each had their own personalities and concerns, making them seem like a real group of people rather than just a bunch of generic scientists on an expedition. The only downside for me is that it was over too quickly, as I was really enjoying the novella, but as it's the first in a series of four stories, the next being 'Artificial Condition', which is now available (as of May 2018), I will definitely be looking forward to reading more of the Murderbot Diaries. science-fiction"}

This is a gritty story about an android with a murderous past and a conscience in the present. Contracted as security for a group of scientists, she (yes, she) has managed to to block her governor module, bypassing certain protocols that prevent her from thinking on her own. Becoming self-aware, as well as aware of where she fits in amoung the others in her expedition makes Murderbot a fascinating character. Somehow, as security android, she has become part babysitter and part protector, especially when things start to go wrong. Witnessing the transformation from an android that calls herself Murderbot to a solver of the challenges presented by exploration and exploitation was fascinating and thrilling.

It follows a SecUnit (who calls himself Murderbot) protecting a crew while they explore a planet. Along the way he encounters danger, tolerates humans, and shares his witty point of view. The novella is engaging, funny and action packed. As Murderbot slowly starts to reveal he in a sentient A.I. he describes the strangeness of human social interactions. Through his eyes the nature of the crew's mission unravels, with suspense, as they face danger and threats no one was prepared for. \"The humans hadn\u2019t gotten a lot of sleep last night, from the crowding and the strong possibility of dying.\" The pacing, story and plot flowed together effortlessly. You will quickly become immersed with Murderbot who is not human,\u00a0 but has a soft spot for them. In a short amount of pages I cared about the characters and enjoyed the simply explained sci-fi elemenst. In this future where humans are not constrained to their planet, I was happy to see diverse characters included. I really wanted more of everything, but had to reminded myself there will be more books. I will be continuing on with the series and hope it maintains its great momentum. \"And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.\" Recommended for Readers who - enjoy funny action packed stories - want a quick entertaining read - want to cheer for a socially awkward sentient robot favorite humor sci-fi 13 likes 1 comment"}

{"username":"Michael Smith","date":1528502400000,"review_text":"Wells has written most fantasy novels of a type that just doesn\u2019t appeal to me, so I was only slightly aware of her work. But this one is straight, hardcore science fiction, and it\u2019s quite good. The narrator is nameless because he\u2019s a construct -- more than an \u201cenhanced human,\u201d less than a full machine, designed to be hired out for security work. But \u201cSecUnit,\u201d as the humans for whom he works sometimes call him, has hacked his own governor module, making him a free agent, and because of his often bloody past he has come to think of himself as \u201cMurderbot.\u201d His current assignment is to protect an exploration and scientific survey party of a dozen or so as they look over a new world, to decide whether it\u2019s worth developing. He does the minimum to get by, at least at first, because he doesn\u2019t care that much about the humans and he\u2019d rather immerse himself in the entertainment info channel. But it gradually becomes apparent that someone, somewhere, is attempting to sabotage the group\u2019s activities and Murderbot can\u2019t allow that. This isn\u2019t a terribly long story -- only 150 pages, about the same as one and a half novellas -- but the action is almost continual, so it seems longer. The narrator has a very dry, occasionally self-deprecating sense of humor. This feels very much like the old ANALOG type of action story, but brought up to date. And best of all, it\u2019s only the first in a series."}

Murderbot is a novella following a team of researchers on a planet who suddenly discover something nefarious going on. They have to rely on their assigned security robot, a SecUnit which calls itself Murderbot, to help them get out of their predicament without injury. Unbeknownst to them, their bot has hacked its \u201cgovernor\u201d module controlling its actions, giving it free will to do almost whatever it pleases. This bot was so unique and multi-layered, and that\u2019s one thing I loved about this story. Murderbot liked to watch streams of a television-like program in its downtime, it looked like a human but wore its protective suit almost exclusively to dehumanize itself, while having remarkably human reactions and facial expressions, and had emotion, but hated human emotion or interacting with humans...mostly because it was shy. It\u2019s inner dialogue was engaging, with a good dose of humor mixed in. The humans were initially vague and indistinctly drawn, but as the plot moved along, I grew to like many of them, especially their leader, Dr. Mensah. This novella had pretty much nonstop action.

Their crippling, nigh-autistic social anxiety at dealing with people made my heart twinge \u2013 basically Murderbot is SO SWEET and is my favourite and they must be protected at all costs. It\u2019s also an interesting world, and I loved the worldbuilding about the soulless corporations and how they rent out equipment to surveying teams, and the ramifications of their constantly cutting corners. I think the only thing is that I would have liked even more information\/exposition about this universe; e.g. there\u2019s a point where a crucial detail is revealed, but because you don\u2019t know anything about the planet-nations in this world, you don\u2019t really know what that entails.

Ce r\u00e9cit, d\u2019\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 140 pages, nous fait d\u00e9couvrir Murderbot, qui s\u2019est appel\u00e9 ainsi par lui-m\u00eame, qui est un andro\u00efde de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour suivre une mission scientifique qui doivent mener des tests sur une plan\u00e8te. il est un andro\u00efde un peu particulier, en effet il a l\u2019air d\u2019avoir une conscience et a hack\u00e9 son module son \u00ab governor module \u00bb, qui le maintenait sous contr\u00f4le. Il est ainsi devenu d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendant. Il s\u2019ennuie \u00e9norm\u00e9ment durant sa mission jusqu\u2019au moment ou des \u00e9v\u00e8nements meurtriers et \u00e9tranges vont apparaitre. Il va devoir trouver la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 s\u2019il veut remplir son but de prot\u00e9ger ce groupe de scientifique. Alors, finalement s\u2019agit-il d\u2019une bonne surprise? H\u00e9, malheureusement, non, car m\u00eame si je suis peut-\u00eatre un peu moins critique qu\u2019Apophis (et encore je viens de me relire), j\u2019ai, pour ma part, moi aussi trouv\u00e9 que cette novella se r\u00e9v\u00e9lait tr\u00e8s moyenne, voir trop moyenne. Disons que pour r\u00e9sumer elle rentre dans le vite lu, d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu et tout aussi vite oubli\u00e9, la preuve je viens de ressortir ma liseuse pour \u00e9crire cette chronique, tant il y a des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont je ne me souvenais plus. Mais j\u2019y reviendrais plus tard. D\u00e9j\u00e0, concernant l\u2019intrigue, rien de bien r\u00e9volutionnaire. On est sur une course en avant du groupe pour tenter de survivre face \u00e0 une menace inconnue. Le rythme est pr\u00e9sent, oui \u00e7a va vite, tr\u00e8s vite, le soucis c\u2019est que voil\u00e0, l\u2019intrigue n\u2019a rien de complexe, a du mal \u00e0 s\u2019imposer, ce qui fait qu\u2019elle a par cons\u00e9quent aussi du mal \u00e0 captiver. On a l\u2019impression d\u2019une id\u00e9e qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place rapidement et trait\u00e9e tout aussi rapidement. Cette histoire de mission qui doit rester secr\u00e8te et autre n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 me happer, \u00e0 me passionner pour la simple raison qu\u2019il manque un truc qui me donnerait envie de comprendre. Il faut dire aussi que l\u2019histoire est balay\u00e9e tellement rapidement qu\u2019il est dur d\u2019arriver \u00e0 entrer dans l\u2019intrigue sans \u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la conclusion. En plus Martha Wells a le don d\u2019utiliser des ellipses qui sont l\u00e9g\u00e8rement frustrantes, principalement dans la conclusion, qui donne vraiment l\u2019impression de dire \u00ab pif pouf \u00bb j\u2019ai rempli mon intrigue, voil\u00e0 mais j\u2019ai laiss\u00e9 plein de trous non expliqu\u00e9s. \u00c7a ne devrait pas se voir. Concernant l\u2019univers construit au fil des pages, l\u00e0 aussi finalement nous restons tr\u00e8s en surface avec cette id\u00e9e de compagnies qui s\u2019entred\u00e9chirent, d\u2019argent facile et de profit qui prennent le pas sur la morale. Cela aurait pu \u00eatre sympa, si cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit de fa\u00e7on plus solide, car comme l\u2019ensemble de cette novella tout parait finalement trait\u00e9 dans de tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s grandes lignes. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 le r\u00e9cit doit normalement gagner en int\u00e9r\u00eat c\u2019est normalement sur l\u2019andro\u00efde et l\u00e0, \u00e0 nouveau, je dirai bof. On est sur des id\u00e9es d\u00e9j\u00e0 vues et revues, principalement concernant l\u2019andro\u00efde qui se trouve une conscience, mais qui est encore une fois amen\u00e9e sans finesse et de fa\u00e7on trop rapide. On a vraiment l\u2019impression que l\u2019autrice, devant une deadline qui se rapprochait, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9crire un texte vite fait, bien fait, histoire de remplir un objectif. Le soucis est que si vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 un minimum de connaissance en science-fiction, vous pourriez ressortir grandement d\u00e9\u00e7u. Si on ajoute a cela des poins importants frustrants car ils ne sont pas expliqu\u00e9, franchement un andro\u00efde qui pirate son logiciel de contr\u00f4le comme \u00e7a entre le plat et le dessert, et surtout que personne ne le remarque clairement, \u00e7a m\u2019a laiss\u00e9 perplexe. Je n\u2019attends pas obligatoirement un univers d\u2019une grande richesse, voir un truc de hard science, ou encore un r\u00e9cit hautement intelligent, mais voil\u00e0 pour moi l\u2019ensemble ne tient pas la route tant il n\u2019est m\u00eame pas expliqu\u00e9s et que l\u2019autrice nous demande d\u2019accepter trop de choses. Concernant les personnages j\u2019aurai pu ne rien vous dire car, et c\u2019est l\u00e0 que je reviens sur mon besoin de recherche dans le r\u00e9cit, mis \u00e0 part peut-\u00eatre un peu Murderbot, aucun n\u2019arrive \u00e0 s\u2019imposer ou \u00e0 se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler un tant soit peu int\u00e9ressant. Il y a, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, une interaction avec au moins 8 \u00e0 10 personnages et, autant \u00eatre clair, ils m\u2019ont quasiment tous paru interchangeables tant ils ne sont jamais un tant soit peu d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s. Aucun d\u2019entre eux n\u2019est un minimum d\u00e9velopp\u00e9. Il y a bien Mensah qui arrive vaguement \u00e0 se d\u00e9gager de cet ensemble, mais elle s\u2019av\u00e8re assez rapidement caricaturale et surtout ne parait \u00eatre l\u00e0 que pour finalement faire avancer l\u2019intrigue vu que, bien entendu aux vues des r\u00e9flexions soulev\u00e9es, il faut un Humain pour diriger l\u2019\u00e9quipe. Car oui, c\u2019est vrai le principal int\u00e9r\u00eat de ce roman vient surtout du traitement de Murderbot, des questions qu\u2019il doit venir soulever sur la notion d\u2019humanit\u00e9, de personne, de personnalit\u00e9 et aussi d\u2019interaction avec les autres. Sauf que voil\u00e0, autant le dire tout de suite, m\u00eame si cela reste sympa, \u00e0 nouveau l\u2019autrice ne fait que traiter le sujet en surface et il existe de nombreux autres romans qui offrent, un travail, je trouve plus int\u00e9ressant. L\u2019autre soucis aussi avec ce h\u00e9ros c\u2019est qu\u2019il n\u2019arrive jamais justement \u00e0 trouver sa place, oscillant justement entre humanit\u00e9 et machine sans qu\u2019on comprenne vraiment pourquoi et montrant que le r\u00e9cit n\u2019a jamais vraiment r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver le bon ton pour le pr\u00e9senter. Alors oui, c\u2019est vrai, cette novella se lit vite et je pense qu\u2019elle plaira \u00e0 tous ceux qui appr\u00e9cient justement les r\u00e9cits qui vont rapidement \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel, ne viennent pas prendre la t\u00eate, tout en offrant une ou deux r\u00e9flexions faciles et simples. Peut-\u00eatre elle plaira aussi si \u00e0 ceux qui souhaiteraient un moment de d\u00e9tente sans prise de t\u00eate, pour ma part j\u2019ai surtout eu l\u2019impression d\u2019un texte qui a eu du mal \u00e0 me convaincre, mais qui, peut-\u00eatre, aurait pu \u00eatre solide et int\u00e9ressant s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 sous la forme d\u2019un roman et non d\u2019une novella. Au final tout va trop vite, rien n\u2019est vraiment original, tout est amen\u00e9 pr\u00e9cipitamment et donne l\u2019impression d\u2019avoir en partie rat\u00e9 le coche. Concernant la plume de Martha Wells, elle est simple, mais franchement elle n\u2019a rien de r\u00e9volutionnaire ni de vraiment marquante. Certes le c\u00f4t\u00e9 froid vient du fait qu\u2019elle cherche \u00e0 donner voix \u00e0 son h\u00e9ros et narrateur Murderbot, mais il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre le c\u00f4t\u00e9 froid donn\u00e9 \u00e0 un andro\u00efde et l\u2019aspect blas\u00e9 et morne d\u2019un personnage qui parait plus s\u2019ennuyer qu\u2019autre chose. Apr\u00e8s, je n\u2019\u00e9tais peut-\u00eatre pas le public cible pour ce texte, car au vu de la r\u00e9ussite qu\u2019il a aux US il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver son public. Sur le blog. 2 likes"}

It\u2019s a novella, and even given its novella-ness, it was a fast read. I particularly liked the voice of the main character (Murderbot). They felt sorta neuro-atypical to me, but I can\u2019t really put my finger on how exactly, and I\u2019m not sure how much is brain-difference, versus the horrible repressive system they\u2019re living under. There\u2019s a little mystery\/thriller plot, which was fine but not at all the main attraction for me. Mostly I just liked reading about this robot\/human being who is stuck in this system and just wants to watch their TV programs. Pronouns note: Murderbot doesn\u2019t think of themself in the third person, obvi, and the other characters refer to them as \"it\" but I just can\u2019t. \"It\" is for inanimate objects, not people.

{"username":"Monika Cacev","date":1528588800000,"review_text":"All Systems Red is the first in the Murderbot Diaries series which follows Murderbot, an introverted, awkward security unit who is contracted to a scientific expedition on an uninhabited planet. Murderbot spends her days watching entertainment TV, half-assing her job, and avoiding the humans until a neighboring expedition goes dark and she is forced to actually do her job and survive. I love android\/cyborg\/robot characters, especially ones that have trouble relating to humans, and this book hit the mark perfectly. Murderbot is hilarious and relatably awkward, shy, claustrophobic and introverted. She prefers watching shows than interacting with humans, and part of that is her being made in a world that seems to hate bots, but part of it is her own personality. It helps that Wells makes Murderbot very funny, and I enjoyed her quips about everything from how cheap the company that contracts her out is to her own incompetence at her job. I appreciated that she was aware of how unequipped she was to handle military bots and enjoyed how incompetent the antagonists in this were too. A lot of the world-building and relationships between the bots and humans reminded me of the ones in Autonomous and I had to actively remind myself that Murdebot looks human, and not robotic like Paladin. Wells manages to pack a surprising amount of world-building in 100 pages; there are a lot of lines about how bots are treated, the rules which govern them and the attitudes that humans, even augmented humans have towards bots. The rest of the cast is great. I actually really liked Gurathin and how suspicious and untrusting he was of Murderbot; I wouldn't be opposed to having him be a supporting character in the second book. I also really liked the subtle relationship building between Mensah and Murderbot, and though I understand Murderbot's decision in the end, I still felt sad about it. As for the plot it's tight, action packed and great. The best way I can explain it is if the Purge was set in space; it's a short, simple plot that lets us know the characters and the world and kept me invested and reading. I will definitely continue this series and can't wait to see what Murderbot gets up to next. favorites read-and-own"}

{"username":"Ken Richards","date":1757116800000,"review_text":"The Murderbot is an enigmatic individual whose travails are followed in this fine novella by Mary Wells. It is a worthy finalist in the 2018 Hugo Awards. The story is skillfully paced and allows the reader to understand the protagonist's struggle with its role as a Security Unit for a group of scientists on an unexplored planet. A sense of its fear and trepidation that it will fail at its task is palpable, and its determination to isolate itself from its charges so as not to be emotionally affected by the these undertakings is oppressive. The Murderbot seeks solace in downloaded media to wall itself off from any interaction with its erstwhile employers. We get the hint of a backstory tragedy, which has made this behaviour an essential survival mechanism. But when the shit hits the fan, and its charges are endangered, it has no choice but to risk its hard won isolation and protection in its duty to those it has been tasked to protect. I re-visited the stories as a prelude to watching the well-received TV series. I enjoyed the audiobook of this first installement, appreciating the sardonic tome that Wells has crafted so skillfully for Murderbot. 1 like"}
{"username":"Zachariah","date":1528675200000,"review_text":"It was pretty fun reading this sci-fi novella. It was quick and easy, and pretty seamless, with the narration rolling nicely and with enough fit to put a smile on your face. I couldn't get my head around whether or not the main character, Murderbot, was female or male, as the exploration crew it was protecting kept referring to it as \"it\". The premise was rather simple, which made for a quick read. Basically, a group of explorers get into a bit of trouble (and there's a political\/corporate plot in the background that we get a light taste of) and Murderbot helps them get through it by going Arnold Schwarzenegger n the baddies. Murderbot had a bit of personality, with its snarky remarks and its overall outlook towards humans. And there's something human about it because it likes to watch sitcoms whenever it's repairing itself or spending some alone time, which it loves more than anything else. The action sequences were as smooth as water and even then Martha Wells didn't waste time to add a bit of her personal wit here, a bit like Scalzi would. In fact, the action sequences reminded me a lot of Old Man's War. An overall good read, though because it was short I didn't connect with any other character other than Murderbot, and I felt that because of the story's short lifespan I reckon it didn't give me enough. 2 likes"}

And I'm sooooo glad I did. Murderbot is this entity, construct of part human, part bot; that has an incredible personality. The story surreptitiously poses the question of whether these constructs are people or not and I guess that with the way Murderbot is our main character and it's obviously sentient, we know the answer the author believes. And I agree with it. But the story is about much more than that. It has adventure and murders and a bit of a mystery and tough decisions to make. I think that, like with every good book in the history of books, this story makes you question things. It draws parallels with contemporary life and it asks of you to think. Or you could just read it for the murder and the advanced weapons and the science fiction behind the worldbuilding and enjoy it. Either way, I'm already halfway through the next book. fav-otherwordlyish fav-series favourites-forever-and-ever 8 likes 4 comments"}

{"username":"Dara","date":1532908800000,"review_text":"All Systems Red is a bit of a cliched self-aware robot story. The bot refers to itself as a murderbot, doesn't really care for humans, and has no desire to connect with its clients. This could easily feel tired but Martha Wells has crafted an interesting world and story for her flawed Murderbot to live in. There isn't much room for in-depth worldbuilding in a 144 page novella but Wells packs enough in for the reader to understand the setting and why things are the way that they are. The story is told in first person from the Murderbot's POV so there isn't too much depth to the secondary characters. The Murderbot is kind of an unlikable character at first (at least it reminded me of a toxic former friend) but gradually evolves. This was a 3.5 star read for me until the end.

The author did a good job of discrimination the surrounds that I could understand the location. I would have liked a little better description so I could really picture the scene (this is where the longer intro would have paid off). However there was enough there to make it make sense.

Sadly, though, that's where my enjoyment ended. There's no intriguing plot here, and every character except our faulty robot narrator is totally static and uninteresting. I can see why a lot of people have enjoyed this novella. It's funny and fast-paced. But it also fell flat for me. I think I'm done with the Murderbt diaries."}
{"username":"Snowleesi","date":1696291200000,"review_text":"I don't read short fiction. I don't because it is over before I have a chance to immerse myself in the world and start caring about the characters. There is a reason I prefer serialized TV to movies, or multi-volume sagas to stand alone novels. So, had I have had any incling that this is a novella, I wouldn't have picked it up. I'm so glad I didn't know. Remember how I said short fiction doesn't allow me enough time to start caring about its characters? I started caring about Murderbot on page three. She - for me it's definitely a female - is a robot, who hacked its command module and is now basically in possession of free will. Now she loves watching serialized dramas, is vulnerable, shy and most definitely an introvert. She also very deeply cares about the humans she was charged with protecting, and she happens to be very good at it, while shrugging off any attention or gratitude - not because she's indifferent to it, but because she's NOT and so... the feels!

I'd never read or heard of Martha Wells before but now she's on my radar! This book is very short but took me far too long to read because I was on a trip and couldn't focus on it. I had to restart it twice. Once I got home I sat down with it and plowed through it. This book is in the POV of a security robot on a spaceship. It calls itself Murderbot, but only in private. I pictured Murderbot as a woman, I don't know why, maybe because it's a female author? But it is genderless. And it has feelings and emotions that it probably shouldn't have. Murderbot has deactivated its governor module so it can choose to follow commands or not. That sounds incredibly dangerous for all humans involved!

{"username":"Norman Cook","date":1529020800000,"review_text":"There have been a spate of stories in the past couple of years about robots who defy their programming to become unlikely heroes. This one stands out because of the humor that Wells put into it. The protagonist murderbot just wants to chill and watch his entertainment videos. But events conspire to interrupt his malingering. The action then comes fast and furious. One of the themes the this story explores is prejudice against \"foreigners\". The human guardians of the robot, probably rightly considering he's called a murderbot, are wary to an extreme that puts their lives in jeopardy, even when they realize he's not out to kill them. This is an self-contained story, but sets up an interesting universe for a series. The ending is perhaps a bit too pat, and I thought the murderbot's recuperative powers were somewhat unbelievable, but I look forward to further murderbot stories. 2018-hugo-campbell-nominees e-book"}
{"username":"Kelsey","date":1529107200000,"review_text":"Clocking in at a whopping 160 pages, \u201cThe Murderbot Diaries: All Systems Red\u201d is part of Tor\u2019s novella line and the first in (what seems to be) an interesting little series. The premise is a little different than one would expect given the title: the protagonist and namesake, Murderbot, doesn\u2019t really care all that much about its nature now that it has gained sentience and self-control or, alternatively, about world domination and the extinction of human life throughout the galaxy. It just wants to sit quietly and undisturbed in the corner and watch soap operas. Now granted, Murderbot is very good at, well, murder. That\u2019s what it was built for after all. The story starts with Murderbot contracted out by The Company to run security for a small crew of scientists working on a backwater, unexplored planet. And then everything goes to hell. Expect sci-fi trope classics such as: violent confrontation, insidious science fiction corporations, and a diverse cast of characters. The page count and therefore necessary rapid development of the plot doesn\u2019t allow for much character exploration besides Murderbot, which I found to be disappointing, as there was potential there given the author\u2019s interesting take on relationships and augmentation, but perhaps these cultural norms and same crew of characters will be examined in the sequels. I hope so. I enjoyed my time with Murderbot. I hope Tor puts out a collected volume, as the price per novella is a bit steep given the page count. A serviceable read with interesting concepts and enough differentiating features to maybe be worth your while, too. science-fiction"}

At this point it's definitely a comfort read for me - perhaps because I can empathize with Murderbot's \"becoming\" - not wanting to be human but being alive and part of humanity at the same time.

{"username":"Aelvana","date":1530057600000,"review_text":"A team of researchers are conducting tests on a newly discovered planet's surface, accompanied by one company-provided SecUnit that privately calls itself Murderbot. Although Murderbot behaves like the equipment it's supposed to be, it actually overrode some of its own programming so it can function more autonomously. And that becomes critical when unexpected dangers arise . . . I liked this well enough, but it's far too short. Murderbot is the only character with significant development---the team is fleshed out enough to see why Murderbot appreciates their low-stress interactions, but ultimately it means most of the team was interchangeable for me, except for the enhanced human (because he was the only one Murderbot felt cautious about, and not unreasonably, given his suspicions towards it in return). It was funny to find that someone who calls itself \"Murderbot\" is a huge introvert who doesn't actually like people at all. Murderbot would rather watch entertainment than deal with actual humanity. Most of the fight scenes felt poorly described, as well. Murderbot narrates several gunfights with little more than \"and here's where each bullet hit\" kind of description, which made it hard to feel much of a flow to the fighting or much of a sense of danger. I was very annoyed where one fight described all the damage to the opposing forces first, and only then cataloged Murderbot's injuries. My initial impression had been that Murderbot somehow hadn't been hit, since segregating things that way feels like it drains all the tension out of a fight. Overall this was interesting enough that I will probably read the next book, but between the short length and the lack of anything that really grabbed me, it's not on my buy list. (Besides, the ebook price is insane. The book is only 140 pages long.) I rate this book Recommended. See my reviews and more at https:\/\/offtheshelfreviews.wordpress...."}

It\u2019s good when given full control The story is pretty simple, a point A to point B story without too much of a surprise. It\u2019s a good story, but the real shine comes from this hilarious character, who is hilarious because of his subtleties. It reminds me of the indifferent robot in Douglas Adams\u2019 Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, except it can actually do things and ends up saving the humans. To top it all off, it calls itself Murderbot, which couldn\u2019t fit less with its personality and priorities. Full review at: https:\/\/reviewsandrobots.com\/2018\/06\/..."}

It\u2019s a novella of size and for a change its a science fiction book. Actually it\u2019s the first of The Murderbot Diaries series about a Droid that works for some exploration company as security robot. This is actually one of the fascinating aspects of this story: the protagonist being a robot acting as first-person narrator. It gives you some awkward views upon the humans, this bot is working for. This becomes even more interesting as the bot hacked its supervising module, which gives it (or rather him) all the freedom he wants. And, of course, as this is not legal, he lives in constant fear of being detected. It being shorter than a regular novel makes this story a quite fast but nevertheless enjoyable read. I loved sharing the fears with this droid and \u201cseeing\u201d him in action. In the end, this is a good paced fiction with an interesting and unusal character, and I\u2019ll definitely follow up on his life."}
{"username":"Becky B","date":1529193600000,"review_text":"The SecUnit assigned to a group of scientists surveying a prospective planet starts to notice discrepancies between the information that was provided by the Company and what is being observed on the planet. And these aren't just little discrepancies. These are big, huge, potentially-deadly discrepancies. SecUnit usually tries to keep distance from humans, but these humans are more agreeable than most so it would prefer to keep them alive. Also, its record isn't all that stellar and it can't afford any more casualties on its watch. So self-named Murderbot starts trying to figure out what's going on on this planet and how it can keep the scientists alive long enough for rescue. Murderbot is pretty much a cyborg, part cloned organic parts and part machine, but programmed to think of itself as more of a robot than a human. (Though some of the scientists try to get it to start to think of itself as more human.) The whole mystery has the flavor of the best Aliens movies or best Jurassic Park movies\/books. Nature and unknown hostiles out to get a ragtag group of scientists with an unlikely hero who uses smarts and unconventional means to lead them to safety. I personal love that kind book and movie, so I thoroughly enjoyed following Murderbot around and figuring out this mystery. I definitely need to go get the next Murderbot book. You would think that an unemotional protagonist who is very clinical in evaluation of the people it works with and would rather watch TV shows than save the day would cause the reader to be uninterested in what happened, but that wasn't the case. Which is quite a testament to Wells' writing abilities. Recommended to all who like smart scifi thrillers, disaster stories, or scifi fans looking for a quick read. Notes on content: Minor swearing scattered sparsely throughout. About four strong swearwords. No sexual content unless you count the Murderbot telling that it doesn't care for sex scenes in shows and has no sexual parts.

His interactions with his humans are great, although are maybe made almost too easy because said humans are a little too functional - probably a function of the need to cram a novel of plot and character development into a small page count.

{"username":"Kappa","date":1593475200000,"review_text":"All Systems Red elevates itself from standard stranded sci-fi crew fighting for survival for a couple reasons: 1) The story is from the POV of the titular Murderbot, a rogue half-clone\/half-robotic unit that has successfully hacked its governing code and is fully sentient. A great concept already, adding a delightful dash of humour from the introverted Murderbot's all-too-human laziness and awkwardness. This could begin to grate and can feel almost too human in places, but that's where point 2 comes in... 2) All Systems Red smartly stays as a novella so the story, which ultimately is rather tried and true if it weren't for the narrator, never overstays its welcome. This does have some drawbacks as most concepts (such as the sprawling implications of seemingly all these units being sentient as well as wider worldbuilding) cannot be expanded upon but that's not really what the book is designed to do.

For a Murderbot it sure has a lot of emotions. I think why I like this so much is that we all understand how doing the best that we can and sometimes is not enough. We all try for redemption. At the same time, we all get apathetic and bored. We all get afraid and sometimes do not know how to act in social situations. I cannot wait to finish the second book."}

As it is, this book is OK, but not very deserving of any awards or special attention - just another more-or-less generic short adventure. The defining feature of the hero - its love for human TV shows - is barely used, though often mentioned. And as I got it from a list of \"7 Sci-Fi Novels for When You Want to Laugh\", I really wish there were more jokes, or funny dialogues, or basically anything that would make it fit the bill, but there is almost nothing. I wanted to laugh, but I didn't. Maybe chuckled one or two times, but seriously - Laundry Files, for example, is way funnier, and that series is not even billed as a comedy.

The key attraction going in was the \"AI\" narrator, but it's voice and concerns were entirely human. That would be the point I suppose.

Nonetheless the narrator was an interesting character in and of themselves, the story universe was compelling, and it was a decent genre read. A survey team on a remote and dangerous planet experiences curious problems and technical glitches which lead them to suspect sabotage by an unknown party. It's told form the point of view of their Security Unit - a free agent android who's hacked it's own behavior governor so it can spend less time reading and responding to briefings and updates and more time watching downloaded soap operas.

The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I'm not much of a sci-fi gal, since the jargon and overall concepts usually confuse me. I also am just not really into futuristic stories or stories set in space, since I can't conceptualize a lot of whats going on. But after having some success with the Illuminae Files series, I'm intrigued by the genre. I picked up All Systems Red because it's less than 150 pages and I've seen some pretty good reviews of it, so I figured if I should start with sci-fi anywhere, it should be here. Overall, I liked this book. Murderbot is hilarious and honestly one of the most relatable characters I've come across. The trope of a self-aware AI with a sense of humor is always so funny and appealing to me, and I loved reading from its point-of-view. I think it's pretty awesome when an author can make a robot relatable. I, for some reason, got a very femme vibe from Murderbot, even though it has no gender. I've never gotten a female impression from any AI I've ever read, but there's something about this antisocial queen that tugged on my heartstrings. Maybe I just saw a bit too much of myself in Murderbot. I think one of the funniest parts of the book is when Dr. Mensah asked if Murderbot would like to spend time with the crew, and Murderbot--who cannot control its facial expressions readily--gives a look of absolute horror at the prospect of spending time with people. Like, bitch, me too. Talking to people is hard. Murderbot also stands in the corner of the room facing the wall when talking in group settings and I just wish that behavior was acceptable for me, because same. The writing is a little choppy and not very pretty, but I've never read anything else by Martha Wells, so I'm not sure if this was a tactic to make it truly seem like a robot was telling us the story or if she's just a writer who doesn't care about whether her words sound nice. I didn't hate it, but sometimes the choppy wording and sentences could be a tad awkward and I would have to reread them. But the writing lent itself to letting the story move fast, which I always like. What flopped in this book for me was the plot and the ending. The last two chapters were confusing and vague, and I couldn't tell you what the GrayCris group was trying to accomplish and why Murderbot's group had anything to do with it. It was never explained, and I found the fact that Murderbot was unconcious for a majority of the action scenes to be a tad lazy on the author's part. The last chapter was also weird, I don't understand quite what happened since it seemed like everything important had been completely missed by Murderbot and no one bothered to explain it to them. The last few pages seemed out of character for Murderbot as well, and I have no idea why it ended that way or where it will take us in the future. I know this is a series with 3 more books, so I'm guessing we'll learn a lot more about that planet they were on, their mission, the GrayCris group, and why everything happened the way it did. But it seems kind of silly to me to have a 150 page book were things sort of happened and but never got explained. I wanted to love this story, because I really love Murderbot, but nothing seemed to make much sense by the end. I will definitely continue the series since these books are so short and I want more of Murderbot's hilarious narration. I just hope that this story doesn't go in a completely random direction like the ending seemed to promise. I need answers, and I also need more of the human characters introduced in order to truly care for this story. If the next book is solely about Murderbot's journey and we never see those people again or get any answers I'll be pretty pissed. 150 pages just wasn't enough time to articulate an effective plot, at least for this author. 10 likes"}

The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency.\u201d You can also read this review on my blog. (\uff61\u2022\u0300\u1d17-)\u2727 Short and punchy but thought-provoking, All Systems Red is the first novella in the Murderbot Diaries series by Martha Wells, featuring the titular Murderbot as the protagonist. It\u2019s a mystery-adventure set in deep space, with cool tech and a complex, interesting world. Also, much to my enjoyment, it explored ideas I love to see in scifi: what it means to be a person and how technology impacts society. The point-of-view character and protagonist, a corporation-owned security robot, gave itself its name after the company\u2019s cheap parts led to a hardware malfunction and, ultimately, a murderous rampage on the part of Murderbot. Not wanting to be subjected to catastrophic parts failures again, it hacked its own Governor Module and gave itself free will. What does Murderbot want to do now that it doesn\u2019t explicitly have to obey company and client orders? Well, watch a whole lot of space soap operas and download massive amounts of data from entertainment feeds, that\u2019s what: I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,00 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure. #relatable. (Not the murder part, but like...I feel you, Murderbot. Sometimes a sentient being just wants to be left alone and devour some entertainment, y\u2019know?) (I want to add that I\u2019m referring to Murderbot as \u201cit\u201d because that seems like the pronoun it prefers, and it doesn\u2019t identify with any gender. If that ever changes in later novellas or the upcoming novel, I\u2019ll add another note to this!) I want to emphasize that I love that Murderbot explicity doesn\u2019t want to be human. Not in a \u201cew, humans are gross\u201d kind of way, but in a \u201cI am a different form of life and that is perfectly fine, even if I myself haven\u2019t exactly figured out what I want to be\u201d sort of way. It\u2019s great and Murderbot is great and you should read this. Yes, you. Please. The setup for this novella is already interesting on its own: it\u2019s kind of unsettlingly similar to our current situation with late-stage capitalism, just worse, with more advanced technology, and in space. It\u2019s not completely doom and gloom, though; while mega-corporations are omnipresent and even have their own corporate states, they\u2019re not all-powerful. There are other free states and ways of living. (Speaking of, the diversity rep in the novel is great, with many characters mentioning having multiple partners\/same gender partners, and none of the humans I can recall as being white.) So while the world is still often a shitty place in both large and small ways, it\u2019s not hopelessly bleak. In that way, the setting and plot provide an interesting layer of commentary on corporate motivations and how people move around and within money-hungry power structures. While the plot of this novella is short, it\u2019s entertaining and to the point. We have just enough time to take a walk in Murderbot\u2019s shoes, seeing the world through its sardonic point of view, while also seeing how its human crew reacts to its sentience. There\u2019s enough space for the plot and characters to create and release tension around ideas of humanity and free will without the dialogue getting esoteric or the narration getting info-dumpy. The story sticks around just long enough to make you ready to read the next novella right away. Before I try to wrap this up: a nod (or like, many many nods) to Kevin R. Free, the audiobook narrator\/reader. I\u2019ve listened to one other novella he\u2019s narrated, The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps, and his voice and inflection in both of these works of his that I\u2019ve listened to are absolutely wonderful. I can\u2019t imagine Murderbot sounding any other way in my head now. (Speaking of which, my library needs to get the audiobook for the next ones in the series ASAP.) I can\u2019t think of a good way to end this review, if I\u2019m being honest. In the process of writing this, I actually bumped my rating up from 4 to 4.5, rounded up to a 5. I just liked it that much, and it used the novella format exceptionally well to tell its story. I highly recommend checking it out if you have the chance. audio favorites great-protag ...more 8 likes"}

{"username":"TalviLinna","date":1530057600000,"review_text":"This was a fun little book. Like many others I'm sure, I particularly enjoyed the narrator - an apathetic android who wishes humans would just leave it alone so it can watch entertainment feeds, before it gets drawn into a do-or-die situation. As someone who is very introverted and maybe just a little on the spectrum, I identified A LOT with Murderbot when it would say things like needing to watch entertainment feeds for a while to recharge after interacting with humans. Plus, as a genderless non-binary person, it was kind of a relief to read about a character without sex or gender. That's probably the first time I've read a book with an agender main character, so it was refreshing to see that, as well. The book definitely coasted along on its strong and unique main character, though, cause the plot was quite a lot less strong. The plot seemed a bit too simple, and the action scenes seemed to largely consist of Murderbot getting knocked out and then getting carried away by the humans it was supposed to be protecting. The ending was clearly a set-up for further Murderbot adventures - not a bad thing, since I wouldn't mind spending more time with this character. Let's just see if more interesting things happen to it in later stories. favorites sff"}

{"username":"Vel Veeter","date":1735603200000,"review_text":"I guess I will find out, not today, but later in the year whether or not this book becomes a series for me. This is the same situation that always happens with any kind series, but here we are again. In this small novella (again, I am not so sure why this isn\u2019t just the start of a novel that becomes published later, but novellas are big right now in genre fiction), we have a survey mission commissioned by a corporate entity on a foreign planet. The story is narrated through the consciousness of a \u201cMurderbot\u201d a cyborg security specialist enlisted by the corporation to guard over their interests in the mission. This consciousness has what is referred to as a hacked governor connected that is not hampering in the limitations of the programming. Also, there\u2019s a kind of simple-minded or child-like personality embedded into the consciousness so that it finds interactions with the crew (who it neither trusts nor likes much) is a kind of awkward and annoying interaction and then it also loves consuming mass culture. But then, as you could have guessed, changes. This most reminds me of the series of novels by Vanya Huff. Those novels, (The Valor series), are military fiction told tightly from the perspective of a low ranking but highly intelligent and competent sergeant, a cog in the machine. This too has that kind of controlled and competent narrative viewpoint. We are placed within this perspective and have gaps in our information that we have to work through on our own as reader. It\u2019s generally pretty good, but not necessarily my most favorite kind of writing."}
{"username":"Laura","date":1530230400000,"review_text":"I bought the second in the series as soon as I finished the first. It was that good. The sci-fi wasn\u2019t overly heavy but it was a big part of the story. You didn\u2019t feel confused or having to guess what it all meant, it was explained well when it was needed. Overly the story was just so good and simple to a point. A robot that wasn\u2019t all robot. It wanted more, even if that more was just watching butt loads of tv shows and stuff on the entertainment feed. I liked how Murderbot wasn\u2019t really a hero, it was just a robot doing what it wanted to do. Yes, it had to act a part but it helped because it liked them. It didn\u2019t want to die but knew it could be repaired compared to its counterparts. Fear of pain was irrelevant. Fear of death wasn\u2019t, it feared it. Which is what made Murderbot alive. The shortness of the book added to the story, it made the Author focus on what needed to be focused on and ignore unnecessary fluff. Normally with shorter books, you feel like you\u2019ve missed out on stuff, or more could have been added. Not in this case, the story just left you wanted to find out what Murderbot was going to do next."}
{"username":"Gillian","date":1714867200000,"review_text":"The sixth entry in the Murderbot Diaries is coming out soon, so what better way to prepare than rereading everything? I love Murderbot, let\u2019s get that information out of the way. This is my third time rereading All Systems Red and it\u2019s just as good as the first time I picked it up. I think this series has some of the best novellas being published in speculative fiction today. Martha Wells excels in writing non-human characters. Murderbot is funny narrator with a very dry wit that makes you laugh out loud while reading. I love a character that is very snarky and really doesn\u2019t want to do the things they have to. And lets be real, if I was Murderbot, I too would only want to watch episodes of Sanctuary Moon rather than keeping idiots alive on an alien planet. One of my favourite things about this novella is that nobody is a hero. Murderbot is only supposed to rescue clients from rogue fauna or teams turning on each other. They\u2019re not prepared for outside human forces trying to kill their clients due to human politics. Likewise Dr. Mensah and the other members of the PreservationAux team are just scientists trying to do their jobs. They have no combat training and are way over their heads. It\u2019s refreshing to read a story about characters that are not epic heros, they\u2019re just ordinary people that wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time and have to use all their skills to persevere. The Murderbot Diaries also does a really good and interesting job examining the question of what makes a person and the legalities of that status in various cultures. Murderbot isn\u2019t human. They are not legally a person or a citizen. They\u2019re property belonging to a corporation. But Murderbot has feelings, preferences, and thoughts outside their broken government module. And when things get bad, Murderbot makes hard decisions based on their desires and goals, rather than what the Company would consider the best option. It\u2019s a very compelling and often heartwrenching examination of sentience, humanity, and personhood. 2018 2020 2021 ...more 4 likes"}

{"username":"Carol Evans","date":1530230400000,"review_text":"There were three reasons I picked up All Systems Red. #1 \u2013 It was sci-fi and I was participating in #SciFiJune when I read it. #2 \u2013 It\u2019s short and I\u2019m behind on my Goodreads challenge by 4 books. #3 \u2013 It had good reviews. In the end, I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It\u2019s a good story with a truly relatable main character. That relatable character calls itself Murderbot. It is a sentient security robot who has hacked its governor\u2019s module. It\u2019s essentially rogue, but still pretends to be the security robot it is expected to be. The scientists it\u2019s working for run into a dangerous situation and Murderbot does the best it can to protect them. They, in turn, begin to see Muderbot as more of a person and less of a robot. Murderbot though is extremely shy and introverted, interacting with humans in any meaningful way fills it with anxiety. It would much rather watch television shows than do much of anything else. It\u2019s also funny and sarcastic and a robot I would like to hang out with, especially since it doesn\u2019t seem to have much desire or ambition to injure anyone, in spite of its name. Murderbot is awesome. The scientists on the team are a good group of people, but Murderbot, who tells the story in first-person, definitely steals the show. The plot is well-done and moves along quickly. All Systems Red is a fun, light sci-fi novel, but it also brings up some interesting discussion points, which I think is a hallmark of good science fiction. It brings up the ideas of free will, autonomy, and independence, what it means to be human, and about the difficulties faced by introverts on a daily basis.

{"username":"Sir He-Man","date":1531612800000,"review_text":"It's just kind of funny to love a character so much whose name is \"Murderbot\". So, I thought that this was a pretty heavy on the techobabble hard SF story. The characters were mostly too similar to each other and didn't stand out a great deal with the exception of the team leader Dr. Mensah and Murderbot himself. Now, what is Murderbot, you may ask? Well he's sort of a robotic humanoid. He's a cyborg that looks roughly human, and could pass for what is known as an \"enhanced human\" but he was created entirely from human DNA to integrate into a shell that allows him superstrength and of course he can access datastreams and computers directly into his brain a lot more quickly than humans can. He is considered property by the company that hires him out and his thinking largely revolves around TV shows he likes to watch since he secretly hacked his own \"governor module\" which would normally control how obedient he is to normal protocol. The story is adventurous enough and I liked the plot for the most part. Sabotage and corporate shenanigans as people try to betray each other and get rich. It's the perfect material for one of the soap operas that Murderbot would love to watch. The author is able to keep up the suspense level throughout the piece. I thought that Murderbot, who was named for a massacre he was involved in (but his memory got erased afterwards) as a character was filled with irony. He never comes across as a being\/personality with any sadism or sadistic streak. He's coldly logical and hates emotions or emotional interaction. Maybe he was programmed to be uncomfortable with them. But he's definitely more capable than other androids like him particularly because he broke free of being controlled, keeping that on the downlow. Some parts of the story did drag on a bit for me. The scientists often sort of felt too homogenous in terms of character\/personality. Maybe that's because they were on the same project towards the same goal but it came across as a little boring when it was just them doing the talking. I wanted to know a lot more about how different human cultures were in this Bujold-esque future. There are no aliens, but humans have definitely split into different cultural and legal philosophies on different worlds. So it would be worth more to me if I could get more of that aspect with a prequel or sequel. What I really liked was Murderbot's observations of humans, often quite funny, and the way he pieces information together. It's fun to see the detective work that goes into his thinking \"outside the box\" and how it really enhances his position\/abilities and makes him all the more interesting. Overall, a good military\/corporate\/suspense SF entry. 1 like"}

This is not the sort of thing you expect from Wells; the world building is simple, even a bit shallow; we spend nearly all our time in the head of a cyborg whose primary interface with the larger culture is popular serials (that sound an awful lot like telenovelas).

{"username":"Jason Furman","date":1588032000000,"review_text":"This Nebula-winning novella had a relatively straightforward plot, serviceable writing, and only one interesting character--but that character was so interesting it made the entire book worthwhile. The character was a cyborg who is part of a series of manufactured AIs with biological material to make them function better that are generally strictly controlled by their governor modules and treated like machinery. But the cyborg that narrates this book, the first in a four-part series, has turned off it's governor module, developing free will--that it mostly wants to use to watch endless science fiction serials while largely shirking most of its responsibilities as a security bot protecting the humans exploring a strange new planet. Moreover, the character--who calls itself Murderbot--generally hates all of the humans it is designed to protect. The explication is very light and within a page or two of the opening we are off on a close call from aliens followed by a mysterious mass murder of another group of humans, and an adventure in which Murderbot takes cues from the thrillers it has watched. The book never really explains the rationale for the menace and most of the resolution is skipped over and addressed in retrospect. The plot is just interesting enough to keep you reading but hardly the reason to come for the book. Lurking in the background some aspects of the universe the book is set in are explained, including the rapacious \"company\" that leases cheap and badly functioning equipment for the expedition, and a division of worlds with some being free, including differences in how they treat bots. I expect more of all of this in the future books which I probably will end up reading at some point. fiction novella speculative"}

The story is told directly from the point of view of the murderbot which makes for a utterly new take on the alien-type stories where shit (always) goes bad. The murderbot itself is an really refreshing take on the future of bots, who through first \"person\" storytelling, mostly wants to be by itself, avoids talking about it's feelings, dislikes any eye contact and general doesn't really give two hoots about anything except for their TV binge watching. I really enjoyed this short story, reading it in (about) one sitting on holiday. Now the only downside is that it _is_ a short, I finished it so quickly and I don't get to enjoy more of the murderbot protagonist.

{"username":"Rob","date":1531008000000,"review_text":"Executive Summary:This was a fun novella, and I plan to continue with the rest of the series eventually. Audiobook: Kevin R. Free did a good job. It isn't a must listen for me, but it's certainly a decent option if like me you do a lot of audiobooks. Full Review I've said this before in other reviews, but I'm not a huge fan of the Novella series trend that seems to be happening. I generally like longer stories. I often don't feel like they are priced the same as full novels where it seems like I'm not getting my money's worth, especially in audio. I got the ebook of this for free, then promptly forgot I had it and bought the audio on a daily deal. I might not have read it otherwise. I really love the premise of this. I don't read a lot of sci-fi, but what I do tends to be very character-driven space opera. There don't tend to be a lot of robots\/androids. This is still very character-driven. However it's much smaller in scope. Oh and the protagonist is some kind of cyborg who calls himself Murderbot. I liked the humor a lot. It's not so much laugh out loud funny as it is clever\/wry. That suits me just fine. I also really like the humans in this book. The interaction between Murderbot and his humans was what really moved this story rather than the plot. I feel like the crisis could have almost been anything and it wouldn't have mattered. I'm not rushing out to pick up Artificial Condition right away due to it being a novella instead of novel, but it's on my wish list and I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually. 20xx-laser audio-book author-female ...more 13 likes 5 comments"}

Only Murderbot - as he calls himself - is a cyborg, and its its maybe obviously the future, and cosmic colonization has begun, and Archaeologists still exist! And its clearly an allegory about the working class resisting the privileges of the educated middle class. Or at least thats what I saw. Technically also a coming of age story - and written in verbiage unchallenging for 20 or under readers - its a fun little romp, and easily tossed in a day bag meant for the beach."}

Murderbot is assigned to a scientific mission, exploring a new planet, that goes horribly wrong when one of its teams goes radio silent. All it wants, really, is to be left alone to watch its shows and come to terms with its identity, but in the end it can't ignore its feeling of responsibility towards its scientists. The scientists, for their part, are somewhat startled to figure out that Murderbot has a personality. It's a lot to process while they're all busy investigating what the heck happened to the other team and then fighting for their lives. I thought the decisions made by the scientists and Murderbot near the end each made complete sense based on who they were, and the ending was a good jumping off point for the next book in the series, which I will absolutely be reading. 0-genre-scifi 8 likes"}

There's a good reason. The world-building is fascinating. There are humans, enhanced humans and androids. Murderbot works for the Company that supplies them to expeditions to different planets. Various expeditions have different purposes. They may go to collect minerals \/ resources, or to study conditions. Murderbot and his droid counterparts are called SEC units. They provide security for the expeditions. They are weaponized to fight if needed. Murderbot is hilarious, protective of his humans, yet does not want to interact with them. I don't want to spoil the fun but his human expedition is not like the others. There is plenty of action and a surprising new world for Murderbot in this longish novella. My only complaint would be each one is like half a book in this Murderbot Diaries series.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next one, Artificial Condition is already available, with Rogue Protocol releasing on August 7.\u00a0 Without a doubt,\u00a0 I'll be buying and listening to them all.

Instead of a review, though, I'll just leave you with the first paragraph: I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,00 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure."}
{"username":"Liz Mc2","date":1531267200000,"review_text":"Murderbot hooked me from the very first sentence where it says that once it hacked itself so it didn\u2019t have to obey orders, it COULD have gone on a murderous rampage but instead watched a ton of serials and read a bunch of thrillers. I mean, who hasn\u2019t been there, sidetracked by Netflix? This is a relatable construct of robot and cloned organic parts (being a security bot rather than a sexbot, Murderbot explains it does not\u2014they do not?\u2014have sex parts and doesn\u2019t think of itself as having a gender, which does kind of conflate sex and gender). Murderbot tells itself it doesn\u2019t care about its job protecting a survey team, but it can\u2019t help getting interested in them, attached to some of them\u2014they\u2019re nice, unlike other teams it has worked for\u2014and when they are threatened, it steps up to help them. The plot is fast-moving with pretty good action scenes, though I thought the underlying reason for the threat was a bit vague. In the same way, most secondary characters were pretty sketchy. It\u2019s a novella. I loved the way Murderbot tries to figure out how to relate to humans and how to be itself (who\/what is that? How do you know?), and I thought there was a subtle message that genre fiction helped in figuring them out (Murderbot watches a soapy serial that kind of comes in handy when threatened with a real conspiracy). These is a fun, fast story that pokes gently at big questions like what it means to be human, to have agency and freedom. And I know I am going to pay the ridiculous $9.99 novella prices to find out who Murderbot becomes and what it does next. Damn it. sf 3 likes 1 comment"}

{"username":"Lashaan Balasingam","date":1532649600000,"review_text":"You can find my review on my blog by clicking here. Winner of the 2017 Nebula Award for Best Novella, All Systems Red is one of those books that was impossible to ignore with its buzz being almost omnipresent since its release. The praise it was getting was unquestionable and its blurb alone had me hooked and utterly curious to find out what all the fuzz was about. Dying to try novellas again, this series seemed like the perfect re-entry point for me. I mean, how could anything go wrong with an android called a \u201cMurderbot\u201d being the main character? In the end, there\u2019s no denying that this turned out to be addictive and engaging. The journey of this Murderbot is one that develops steadily with a satisfying balance between action and humour. What exactly is All Systems Red about though? This is the story of a SecUnit tasked to protect a team of scientists on their expedition in dangerous fields. Unlike other androids, this one however hacked its governor module (the very component that allows humans to control them) and successfully got its hands on what we would call \u201cfree will\u201d. Instead of turning rampant or escaping its faith as a SecUnit, this android has assigned itself the purpose of protecting its clients at all cost. Remaining inconspicuous among the team is however a struggle, but whenever it can, it will find ways to avoid contact and find peace in isolation. It\u2019s when things go awry with another crew of scientists that this android and its clients find themselves looking for answers, but also pernicious trouble, with unknown danger staring right back at them. For a first installment in The Murderbot Diaries series, All Systems Red does a comprehensive portrayal of artificial intelligence in ways that have rarely been conducted in the past. Instead of having a robot who wants to become human, we find ourselves in front of one that is human. Its personality is incredibly relatable and far more human than some of us could ever be, but this Murderbot only wishes to be left alone in its introverted lifestyle. Stuck trying to hide its true self from a crew of scientists who would never truly understand it, it finds satisfaction in accomplishing its role as a Company-supplied security android in order to stay away from any potential trouble that the knowledge of its free will would have upon it. Interestingly enough, this Murderbot is never referred to as a male or a female throughout the story. While I saw it as a woman all along, I was far too often able to connect myself to its most deepest desires (i.e. being left alone to enjoy some space soap opera). Martha Wells\u2019 writing style also proves to be impeccable in All Systems Red and effortlessly manages to give this android a voice of its own. Without the focus on its gender, she was able to bring the reader to explore subtler details that helped further accentuate the android\u2019s peculiar situation in a world of humans that only sees things from their own selfish position. All Systems Red is a fascinating novella that follows an introverted android in its quest to embrace its true-self while trying to respect its purposes as a Murderbot. What it will come to realize will however force it to embark on an adventure that it might not ever be ready for, as both its purpose and its rights as an android with free will are tested.

{"username":"Ellison","date":1531353600000,"review_text":"Entertaining. The narrator\u2019s tone is light and chatty but its back story is grim - it is not really a robot or an android but a human who has been mechanically enhanced, neutered, and programmed (badly, in this case) to obey whatever orders it is given.

I'm not into shorter books\/novellas but I was told that Tor is reinventing what a novella is so I should check some out. I really enjoyed this. The only con I have is the lack of world building and purpose of these missions (because there is a lack of history).

The whole conflict around Murderbot trying hard to be a full-fledged part of human society, even though he actually hates humans, but he doesn't really and the problem is just that no human has ever really been nice to him - it feels all a bit old hat, and done better. I can't quite put my finger on why, unfortunately. I loved the idea behind the story and the robots being so discriminated on is a fantastic metaphor.

{"username":"Neil","date":1531526400000,"review_text":"This is my third book by Wells, all very different and all very successful. She's one of those journeyman genre writers who has never had a big breakout book but is consistently good. The lead character is a cyborg, a security android with some original human flesh at the core but fitted out with many implants and a governor module that requires it to respond to certain directives. Such beings are sent with humans (mostly augmented their own implants, but still their free will) as the muscle on missions, particularly interplanetary explorations. They are usually looked down on by humans as tools of violence, which doesn't particularly bother them, but the twist here is that the \"murderbot\" in question has hacked its governor module. It's not trying to rebel, but wants to be able to binge watch television programs in peace on long boring missions. This particular mission is a muddle though. During a planetary exploration, the scientists are attacked by some vicious local fauna, and in the aftermath, some bigger problems are discovered. We also discover that our protagonist (who reads like an autistic human, adding another dimension to the tale) has an interesting past, and perhaps deeper reasons for hacking the governor module than we originally guessed. This works as an action novel, or as an exploration of free will in a cyborg future. I happened to read it at the same time as I was reading John Scalzi's Lock In, and the two address similar themes in interesting and different ways. I think Tor is onto something with all of these new novella length series. It's a nice compromise between SF's short story distant past and mega-tome recent past. Very much recommended! 1 like"}

{"username":"Anissa","date":1531785600000,"review_text":"I recall seeing The Murderbot Diaries all over the place when it came out and I never got around to reading it. I have a hard enough time with book series, a novella series is really a way to test my patience. My original plan was to await all of the parts publishing and then read them straight through. It happened that I have four psychological thriller arcs to read and I needed something in between that broke up the theme. Short fiction is best in this case and I was able to read this in almost one sitting. I enjoyed it so much I was tempted to go right into the next but I restrained myself and it'll be awaiting me once I've wrapped another. SecUnit\/Murderbot's voice is clear, witty and wry, while sympathetic. Thoroughly enjoyable. Who knew bots just want to Netflix and chill like people? The mystery here got me and I want to know what's going on with those corporate entities and where this is all going. The team of humans in Murderbot's charge had a good showing here too and I was really glad they survived. Among all my other burning questions: What's next on RaFOSM? Because that sounds like a show I'd enjoy and should be a thing in this world. Recommended to science fiction fans who like sentient robots and AI systems.

{"username":"Claudia","date":1533513600000,"review_text":"I\u2019m against the flow again: I did not resonate with this one; didn\u2019t like the bot either. Too cheesy for my taste. If in a fantasy work I welcome cheesy stuff (if it\u2019s not too much), in a sci-fi one I expect the \u201cwhat if\u201d to surprise me with ideas and worldbuilding. I just don\u2019t care about an emotional bot who\/which watches soap opera... I guess I already have three \u2018robots\u2019 on a pedestal and it\u2019s hard for another to rise up to them: Reynolds\u2019 Hesperus, Asimov\u2019s R. Daneel Olivaw and Herbert\u2019s Erasmus. So, if you like a mystery case on a faraway planet, then this is for you. If you look for a more scientific approach, look somewhere else. sci-fi 33 likes 2 comments"}
